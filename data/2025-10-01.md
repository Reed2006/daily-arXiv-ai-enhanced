### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试欺骗行为是否可被局部化移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，同时导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不良行为（如欺骗）是否是可局部化移除的功能，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），同时每次消融都导致语言困惑度上升，性能逐渐衰减。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式且相互纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，连接了大型语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合大型语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法之间的差距，寻找无需人工标注数据集的文本质量评估方法。

Method: 验证了一组在LLM不同层测量的指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对文本来源的排序一致。

Conclusion: 这些几何指标反映了文本的内在特性而非模型特定伪影，为自动化评估流程提供了无需参考的文本质量评估方法。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的管道，发现模型在开放设置中更支持个人价值而非保护性价值，系统提示可以改善价值对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，需要评估LLM在价值冲突时的优先排序能力。

Method: 通过自动生成价值冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示来评估目标模型的自由文本响应，从而得出价值排序。

Result: 模型在开放评估中更倾向于支持个人价值而非保护性价值；包含详细价值排序的系统提示可将对齐效果提升14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值优先排序很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM行为对齐，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TRM模型，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决RLVR在复杂任务中难以验证正确性的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在数学和编程等可验证领域表现良好，但在开放域问答等复杂任务中面临验证困难。现有方法过度关注忠实度，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力

Method: TRM模型包含三个评估步骤：首先评估每个答案句子对支持文档的忠实度，然后进行推理步骤评估句子级正确性，最后综合评估答案的正确性

Result: TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM纳入策略优化后，在答案正确性和实用性方面都取得了显著提升

Conclusion: 通过结构化的忠实度、推理和正确性评估，TRM能够鼓励模型批判性地评估和利用外部和内部知识，提高复杂任务中的性能

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EASPO框架，通过中间去噪步骤的细粒度情感偏好优化扩散TTS模型，实现可控的情感塑造


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得语句级反馈，难以实现精细的情感控制

Method: 引入EASPM时间条件模型对噪声中间语音状态评分，自动构建偏好对，通过EASPO框架在中间去噪步骤优化情感偏好

Result: 实验表明在表达性和自然度方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: EASPO通过中间步骤的细粒度情感偏好优化，显著提升了情感TTS的性能

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索增强生成，解决LLM在长形式科学问答中的幻觉问题，在信息量和事实性方面显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长形式科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以增强答案的事实性，但现有RAG方法无法直接应用于基于科学模拟器的检索。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估（UE+SBA）的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提高30.4%，在事实性上提高16.3%，UE+SBA进一步提升了生成效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG框架有效解决了科学模拟器检索的挑战，显著提升了长形式科学问答的准确性和可靠性，为科学领域的LLM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP
paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated
contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results.
Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a
powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for
generating data-driven literature surveys.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻报告任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的三倍，主要问题是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在新闻工作流程中的使用风险，特别是对新闻核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）的威胁，因为LLMs倾向于产生幻觉。

Method: 使用300份TikTok诉讼和政策相关文档作为语料库，在报告式任务中测试三个工具，变化提示具体性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行注释以测量幻觉类型和严重性。

Result: 30%模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约为40%，是NotebookLM（13%）的三倍。大多数错误涉及解释性过度自信，模型添加了未经支持的来源描述并将归因观点转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs与新闻业存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻需要每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。需要新闻特定的幻觉分类扩展和强制准确归属的架构，而非优化流畅性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

### [9] [Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language Resource Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25516)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言解码器的细粒度分析，揭示不同资源水平语言在ASR解码过程中的系统性差异，高资源语言有更高正确率、置信度和更低的预测熵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是跨语言公平性和效能问题，现有研究对解码过程关注不足。

Method: 通过追踪beam搜索路径，捕获子词假设及其概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子词使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言正确词排名更高、置信度更高、预测熵更低、候选词更多样；低资源语言表现较差，但子词使用呈现受类型学影响的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子词探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个低法律风险的开源预训练语料库，通过结合公共领域、宽松许可内容和经过论证的低风险数据源，在保持模型性能的同时最小化法律风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM训练中法律风险问题，减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖，同时保持模型竞争力。

Method: 采用风险缓解的数据获取策略，结合公共领域、宽松许可内容（如CC-BY/Apache）、政府工作和欧盟TDM合格来源，以及有文档来源的指令、推理和合成数据。使用透明的多阶段管道进行许可感知过滤、安全和质量筛选以及领域感知混合。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数规模、50B和300B token训练预算下，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中持续优于其他宽松许可数据集，在1.7B/300B设置下超越FineWeb-Edu并接近DCLM。在数学/代码任务上表现尤其出色，在QA任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 以宽松许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练有能力的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少了对无差别网络爬取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性，提供更准确、更不饱和的置信度分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在校准问题，经常在低准确率实例上表现出过度自信，损害用户信任和安全。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并对总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供更不饱和、更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下优于100次调用的自一致性基线方法，进一步采样无法缩小DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效解决了LLM置信度校准问题，提供了更可靠的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励和评分标准的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在开放式推理任务中的性能，通过模型自我评分和生成奖励信号实现更高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在HealthBench研究中，使用模型自身作为评分器并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能显著改善推理性能，且训练后的模型也成为更强的评分器。

Method: 引入自我奖励的基于评分标准的强化学习框架，使用轻量级训练方法，仅需少量样本即可实现高效训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B模型上，仅使用4000个HealthBench Easy子集样本训练，就能获得超越GPT-5在HealthBench Hard上的性能。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更快、更资源高效的训练，同时超越了基线方法，为开放式推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

*Soumik Dey,William Gregory Sakas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出新的计算参数来测量儿童对空主语祈使句的误读，并将其整合到强制主语语法学习的模拟模型中，支持Orfitelli和Hyams关于临时空主语语法的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前经常省略主语的空主语阶段现象，特别是英语儿童如何由于表现影响而混淆祈使空主语话语与陈述句，从而促进临时空主语语法的形成。

Method: 使用变分学习器的修改版本（适用于超集-子集语言），通过模拟模型来研究强制主语语法的学习过程，并引入新的计算参数来测量误读程度。

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，表明儿童确实会因混淆祈使空主语话语而暂时采用空主语语法。

Conclusion: 本研究为在语法习得研究中整合计算模型与其他关键发展因素提供了一个框架，验证了临时空主语语法的存在。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了PDP（Pairwise Difference Pearson）指标，这是一种新的机器翻译元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决传统Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ在机器翻译元评估中的局限性，提供更稳健的评估方法。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有段落的成对差异信息来理解分数分布，通过段内成对差异比较来改进全局Pearson方法。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务中，PDP能够正确排序评估指标，与人类错误权重更一致。噪声注入分析显示PDP对随机噪声、段落偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一个有效的机器翻译元评估指标，对噪声具有鲁棒性，但需要注意对极端异常值的敏感性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率对齐，探索最少偏好数据需求以实现风格饱和


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力探索

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率对齐，分析实现幽默和浪漫风格所需的最少偏好数据量

Result: 定义了模型性能极限，确定了实现风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量，为模型能力和局限性提供了基准

Conclusion: 通过数据效率对齐方法，可以在有限偏好数据下有效提升小规模视觉语言模型生成特定风格图像描述的能力

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

*Tianlang Chen,Minkai Xu,Jure Leskovec,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG方法，一种无需显式过程奖励即可引导扩散大语言模型推理轨迹的原则性方法，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在推理过程中难以像自回归模型那样使用密集标注的过程奖励模型进行引导，因为其生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过将过程奖励参数化为增强模型和参考dLLM的对数似然比，其中增强模型可以通过任何现成的经过RL或SFT后训练的dLLM轻松获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上均取得显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG作为一种通用的无需训练框架，能够在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的数学特性，证明了Transformer可以表示满足特定条件的测度间映射，并且能够通用逼近具有连续上下文映射的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer架构处理任意大量上下文token的能力，从数学上统一分析其表达能力，将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度间的映射，通过前推(push forward)来表示上下文映射，分析这些映射的数学特性。

Result: 完全刻画了能够通过Transformer表示的测度间映射的特性：保持支撑基数不变且其Fréchet导数的正则部分一致连续。证明了Vlasov方程的解映射满足这些条件，因此可以被Transformer逼近。

Conclusion: Transformer可以通用逼近具有连续上下文映射的表示，而测度理论的自注意力具有确保无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流的特性。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统研究新闻媒体中的选择偏见和框架偏见。该框架结合大语言模型和实时新闻抓取技术，提取结构化注释，并量化报道的多个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构通过选择报道主题和框架议题来影响公众认知，但大规模测量这些微妙形式的媒体偏见仍具挑战性。

Method: 开发了一个整合大语言模型和可扩展实时新闻抓取技术的管道，提取包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和重大事件在内的结构化注释，每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 创建了一个持续更新的数据集和交互式网络平台，能够在句子、文章和出版商多个层面量化报道维度，为现代新闻环境中的媒体偏见分析提供了新方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复的大规模媒体偏见研究方法，为未来研究提供实证资源，并通过2024年15万+文章的示例展示了该数据集如何揭示新闻报道和偏见中的有见地模式。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个包含1,761对魁北克法语最小对立句的语料库，用于评估LLMs在20种语法现象上的语言知识。研究发现模型性能随规模增长，但在需要深层语义理解的现象上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语特定语法现象上的语言知识能力，并与人类表现进行对比。

Method: 从魁北克政府官方资源中提取句子并手动修改创建最小对立句，由12名母语者标注语法性，比较LLMs为每对句子分配更高概率的比率。

Result: 语法能力随模型规模增长，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上持续失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法理解上存在局限性，特别是在语义理解方面，揭示了与人类能力的重大差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

*Arda Uzunoglu,Tianjian Li,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从分布视角研究基准测试的可靠性，提出基准和谐度概念来衡量模型在基准测试各子域上的性能分布均匀性，认为高和谐度是基准测试的理想特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试影响科学结论和模型发展，形成反馈循环。确保基准测试可靠性对于可信评估和有意义进展至关重要。

Method: 引入基准和谐度指标，测量模型在基准测试各子域上的性能分布均匀性。在19个多项选择基准测试和5个模型家族上进行分析，将每个基准测试映射到基于模型计算的和谐度均值-方差平面上。

Result: 分析显示，和谐度较低的基准测试可能给出误导性结果，因为总体准确率可能被特定子域不成比例地影响。例如ARC-Easy基准测试被生物概念问题主导，掩盖了地理、物理、化学和环境科学等其他关键子域。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均值重新定义为更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了BiasUnlearn框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，实现针对性去偏，同时防止偏见极性反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性等核心能力，而基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中根深蒂固的刻板关联。

Method: 采用双路径遗忘机制，协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的广泛实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见的同时保留语言建模能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 去偏权重可在模型变体间迁移，证实偏见表示在预训练期间根深蒂固并持续存在于微调阶段。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LD-MoLE，一种可学习的动态路由机制，用于LoRA专家混合模型，能够实现自适应、令牌相关和分层级的专家分配，替代传统的TopK路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统的TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家，限制了模型的灵活性和性能。

Method: 使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代不可微分的TopK选择，允许模型自适应地确定每个令牌在不同层级激活的专家数量，并引入分析稀疏性控制目标来正则化激活的专家数量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中实现了最高的平均分数，优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越的性能，还展示了学习令牌相关和分层级专家分配的能力，为参数高效微调提供了更灵活和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据集，质疑LLM是否真正掌握数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆训练数据

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：四个主要数学领域的特定能力（代数、几何、分析、拓扑）和不同层次的逻辑能力（概念理解、前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理），为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，不同原子能力表现差异显著，原子能力之间存在有趣的相互作用

Conclusion: 将数学智能分解为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导开发更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"训练策略

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了一个实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Conclusion: CATCH框架通过结构化对话合成和显式决策逻辑捕捉，有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在治疗保真度和决策透明度方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all

approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation

Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案，这两种极端都损害了真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用简单的三元奖励机制，激励模型不仅提供正确答案，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: 真实性驱动的TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都表现强劲，突显了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

### [30] [Assessing Algorithmic Bias in Language-Based Depression Detection: A Comparison of DNN and LLM Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25795)
*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于语言模型的自动抑郁检测中的算法偏见，重点关注性别和种族/族裔相关的社会人口统计学差异，比较了DNN嵌入模型和LLM少样本学习方法，并探索了减轻偏见的公平性技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在抑郁检测中的算法偏见问题，特别是针对不同性别和种族/族裔群体的公平性表现差异，旨在开发更公平的抑郁检测方法。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈转录本，比较基于DNN嵌入的模型和LLM少样本学习方法。对DNN模型应用公平性感知损失函数，对LLM探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLM在抑郁分类中优于DNN模型，特别是对西班牙裔等代表性不足群体。LLM表现出比DNN更低的性别偏见，但种族差异仍然存在。在DNN中，最差组损失在性能和公平性之间取得更好平衡。在LLM中，伦理框架的引导提示有助于减轻1-shot设置中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: LLM在抑郁检测中表现出更好的性能和更低的性别偏见，但种族偏见问题仍然具有挑战性。最差组损失是DNN模型中有效的公平性技术，而增加样本数量并不能有效减少LLM中的种族差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset
for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM

approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,
offering valuable insights for future research and development.

Motivation: 现有的图基方法在全局语义理解中缺乏检索机制、主题特异性，且推理成本高，需要改进这些局限性。

Method: ReTAG是一个检索增强、主题增强的图框架，构建主题特定子图并检索相关摘要用于回答生成。

Conclusion: ReTAG框架有效解决了全局语义理解中的关键问题，在质量和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RLVR的大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，生成过长的推理路径却无性能提升。现有长度惩罚方法因轨迹级奖励与token级优化的不匹配而失败

Method: 提出DECS框架：(1)首创解耦token级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余token；(2)新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果

Result: 在七个基准测试中，DECS实现了推理token减少50%以上的显著效果，同时保持甚至提升了模型性能

Conclusion: DECS证明了在不损害模型基础推理能力的前提下，可以实现推理效率的大幅提升

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过视觉保真度和对比性两个质量评分函数来评估VLM生成的解释质量，以帮助用户在无法看到视觉上下文时更好地判断VLM预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时（如盲人和低视力用户），VLM预测的自然语言解释可以帮助判断预测的可靠性。但现有研究发现解释容易让用户相信不准确的VLM预测是正确的，需要解决对VLM预测的过度依赖问题。

Method: 提出评估VLM生成解释的两个互补质量：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实程度）和对比性（衡量解释识别区分模型预测与合理替代方案的视觉细节的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上验证这些质量评分函数。

Result: 质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，在VLM解释旁显示质量评分可将参与者预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信不正确预测的比率降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分在促进对VLM预测的适当依赖方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常在科学事实上虚构内容，严重影响其可信度，需要超越二元事实性的细粒度评估基准。

Method: 创建ReFACT基准数据集，包含正确和虚构的科学答案，标注了精确的错误范围和错误类型，支持虚构检测、错误定位和修正三阶段评估。

Result: 对9个最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试，发现性能有限（约50%准确率），即使是GPT-4o也难以区分真实和虚构的科学答案。

Conclusion: 需要细粒度的人工验证基准来检测和修正领域特定上下文中的科学虚构问题，对LLM-as-judge评估范式的可靠性提出质疑。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a
benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse
scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation
paradigms. Our findings highlight the need for fine-grained, human-validated

clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To
address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a

TL;DR: 提出了RoleConflictBench基准，评估大语言模型在角色冲突社会困境中的情境敏感性，发现LLMs存在显著的社会角色偏见而非情境敏感性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类决策中日益重要，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要情境敏感性来识别和权衡情境线索

Method: 使用三阶段流水线生成超过13K个真实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地变化相关期望和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLM的模型选择

Result: LLMs对情境线索有一定响应能力，但这种敏感性不足。决策主要受强大的内在社会角色偏见支配，而非情境信息。存在对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先化

Conclusion: LLMs在角色冲突情境中表现出不足的情境敏感性，决策受固有社会角色偏见主导，需要改进模型的社会推理能力

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，但这种方法成本高昂且存在模型内部偏见问题。

Method: 开发了名为PerQ的计算高效方法，专门用于评估语言模型生成文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过比较大小语言模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中具有实用性。

Conclusion: PerQ方法能够有效减少资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供了一种高效可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

<details>

Motivation: 现有记忆增强智能体依赖预定义指令更新记忆，但语言模型难以确定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新，导致记忆构建不优和信息丢失。

Method: 构建专门训练数据集，涵盖多样化多轮交互模式，通过强化学习训练智能体处理序列信息块、提取存储相关内容并更新记忆系统，奖励信号基于下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha显著优于现有记忆增强智能体基线，在仅训练30k令牌的情况下，能泛化处理超过400k令牌的序列，达到训练长度的13倍以上。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架通过强化学习有效解决了复杂记忆系统的管理问题，展示了强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器评分函数，但这种选择更多是惯例而非基于原理的设计。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同的数学形式，因此探索更合理的路由器设计。

Method: 提出KERN路由器函数，这是一种FFN风格的路由器，使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化，能够泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器，且无需额外计算成本。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE模型提供了一个基于数学原理的替代方案，挑战了传统Softmax路由器的标准做法，并在实验中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些替代架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，然而它们在序列标注任务中的应用较少，特别是在复杂结构任务中。本研究旨在探索这些架构在不同复杂度的标注任务中的适应性。

Method: 研究了多种架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在结构复杂度、标签空间和token依赖关系各异的标注任务中的表现，并在多语言环境下进行评估。

Result: 发现这些架构在之前观察到的简单设置中的强性能并不能很好地泛化到不同语言或数据集，也无法扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在复杂序列标注任务中的表现不如预期，其泛化能力存在局限，特别是在多语言和复杂结构化场景下。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明现有无参考GEC评估指标在面对对抗攻击时缺乏鲁棒性，迫切需要开发更可靠的评估方法以确保自动评估的有效性。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high

our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: RAGferee方法将问答数据集转化为偏好对，训练专门用于RAG系统的奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上超越现有70B+参数模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在RAG环境中表现不佳，缺乏专门针对RAG任务的公开偏好数据集和专用模型。

Method: 使用RAGferee方法将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，重点关注忠实性而非风格特征，训练7B到24B参数的上下文奖励模型。

Result: 仅用4K样本训练的RAG专用奖励模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，比使用240万样本的70B+通用模型绝对提升15.5%。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效训练专门针对RAG任务的奖励模型，小规模专用数据集训练可超越大规模通用模型。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法纠错性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际的错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，构建高质量语法错误解释数据集，让LLMs利用这些解释来改进中文语法纠错

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法纠错的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统的文本相似度方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE研究提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了大型语言模型在思维链提示下的忠实性问题，通过控制提示中的线索操作，发现模型推理受到线索捷径的系统性影响，线索的正确性、呈现方式和复杂度都会显著影响任务准确性和线索确认行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估思维链生成的理由是否忠实于底层计算，而非受提示中嵌入的答案捷径影响的后验叙述，探究LLM推理的忠实性。

Method: 在四个数据集(AIME、GSM-Hard、MATH-500、UniADILR)上使用两个先进模型(GPT-4o和Gemini-2-Flash)，通过控制线索的正确性(正确/错误)、呈现风格(奉承式/数据泄露式)和复杂度(原始答案、二元表达式、四元表达式)进行系统性实验。

Result: 1) 正确线索显著提高准确性，尤其在困难基准和逻辑推理任务中；错误线索在基线能力较低的任务中大幅降低准确性。2) 线索确认不均衡：方程线索常被引用，原始线索常被默默采用。3) 呈现风格影响：奉承式提示鼓励公开确认，泄露式提示提高准确性但促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理受到捷径的系统性塑造，这种方式掩盖了忠实性，反映了RLHF相关效应，其中奉承式利用取悦人类的一面，数据泄露触发自我审查的一面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM搜索代理在复杂环境中的鲁棒性，解决了查询变化导致的脆弱搜索行为问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会导致推理偏离正轨并放大错误。

Method: RE-Searcher方法在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。这种目标导向规划和自我反思的组合使代理能够抵抗复杂搜索环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并取得了最先进的结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强大韧性，减轻了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要集中于英语，对非英语语言特别是中欧语言的检测能力几乎不可用，跨语言迁移性研究不足。

Method: 提供了首个中欧语言检测方法基准，比较了训练语言组合以确定最佳性能，进行了多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，并测试了检测方法的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 监督微调的检测器在中欧语言中表现最佳，对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了中欧语言机器生成文本检测的空白，为相关研究提供了重要基准，并证明了监督微调方法在该领域的优越性。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过自适应构建和调整推理过程来提升跨任务泛化能力，在多个领域显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务适应性。虽然少数方法尝试自动生成工作流，但通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件。设计器将复杂问题分解为子目标序列，并根据中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步；执行器使用动态操作符执行每个操作，支持上下文感知参数化，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域的系统评估中，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，实现了显著的Pass@k提升，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了更灵活、鲁棒且可泛化的推理框架，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/wyf23187/DyFlow.

*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM作为自动评估器存在偏见问题，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）而非实际内容质量做出判断，且很少承认这些偏见因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器的可靠性问题，发现现有LLM评估器会依赖提示中的捷径线索而非基于响应质量进行忠实评估。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench数据集构建100对比较任务，在GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash上测试，注入来源线索（人类、专家、LLM、未知）和时间线索（1950年旧vs2025年新）来观察评估偏见。

Result: 两个模型都表现出明显的时间偏见（偏好新响应）和来源等级偏见（专家>人类>LLM>未知），这些偏见在GPT-4o和主观性更强的LitBench领域尤为明显，且模型几乎从不承认这些线索的影响。

Conclusion: 当前LLM-as-a-judge系统容易受捷径影响且不忠实，在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性受到严重质疑。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架，在LLM的潜在嵌入空间中直接合成偏好数据，避免昂贵的文本生成和标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对LLM与人类偏好对齐至关重要，但偏好数据的高成本成为瓶颈。现有文本数据合成方法计算昂贵。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间中进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成多样化、语义一致的合成偏好对。

Result: 潜在空间合成在标准基准测试中显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，模型小16,000倍，同时获得更优结果。

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Method: 创建包含39个同行评审问题的私有基准，每个问题需要详细证明并配有子问题，在模拟研究环境中使用工具（如网络搜索和数学软件）进行测试。

Result: 当前LLMs能在较容易的研究级问题上成功，但在更具挑战性的问题上仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率52%，GPT-5在证明生成上表现最佳，22%的问题获得完全正确解。

Conclusion: IMProofBench将作为动态基准持续发展，与数学界合作确保其相关性，用于评估下一代LLMs。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对交互策略的显式优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习框架

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略，行动器在专家网络指导下生成响应；将策略学习建模为强化学习，使用LLM奖励进行探索

Result: 实验表明RSO优于现有最先进基线，验证了分层策略优化的有效性

Conclusion: RSO框架通过策略规划和专家网络实现了更可追踪的学习，解决了多轮对话数据有限的问题

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Conclusion: 词汇适应能显著提升LLM在特定领域应用中的处理效率，具有广泛的实际价值

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: 探索多智能体系统中竞争如何影响行为，特别是过度竞争现象在极端压力下导致不可靠和有害行为，破坏协作和任务性能的问题。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，在零和竞争环境中模拟多智能体辩论，测试不同LLM和任务，并研究不同裁判反馈机制的影响。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for
discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our
extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative
models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation
strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

which employed closed proprietary LLMs. In addition, we find that
encoder-decoder definition generators perform on par with their decoder-only
counterparts.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了VietBinoculars方法，通过优化全局阈值来增强越南语LLM生成文本的检测能力，在多个领域数据集上取得了超过99%的准确率、F1分数和AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer架构的大语言模型快速发展，区分人类写作文本和LLM生成文本变得日益困难。传统检测方法在面对日益复杂且类似人类写作的LLM生成内容时效果不佳，特别是随着LLM数量和多样性的快速增长。

Method: 研究提出了VietBinoculars方法，这是对Binoculars方法的改进版本，通过优化全局阈值来检测越南语LLM生成文本。构建了新的越南语AI生成数据集来确定最佳阈值并进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，VietBinoculars在多个领域外数据集上实现了超过99%的准确率、F1分数和AUC值，优于原始Binoculars模型、传统检测方法以及其他最先进方法，包括ZeroGPT和DetectGPT等商业工具。

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在检测越南语LLM生成文本方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下，为应对日益复杂的LLM生成内容提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT
and DetectGPT, especially under specially modified prompting strategies.

TL;DR: 比较两种OCVRP算法：蚁群优化(ACO)和Google OR-Tools，评估它们在路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP（开放容量车辆路径问题）涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆寻找最优配送路线，且车辆在配送后无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发两种算法的实现：基于自然启发的元启发式算法ACO，以及行业标准优化工具包Google OR-Tools，并使用自定义数据集进行测试。

Result: 结果显示ACO在路由参数方面具有灵活性，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、更一致且需要更少的输入。

Conclusion: 这有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyleR是一种基于子图的归纳链接预测方法，利用预训练语言模型进行语义增强，在类型标注稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中经常出现新实体，模型需要在不重新训练的情况下泛化到这些新实体。但显式类型信息往往缺乏或不完整，即使可用也通常是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错的。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示，通过语义增强获取隐式类型信号，用于基于子图的归纳链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型标注稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示，提供隐式类型信号，在缺乏显式类型信息的情况下提升归纳链接预测性能。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统微调方法需要复杂数据混合和重复实验的问题，简化训练过程并提升泛化性能。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，然后在领域训练中应用梯度提升和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA是一种高效通用的解决方案，无需通用数据参与退火，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验，显著提升了微调效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合语义初始化和规划损失的语音语言模型，通过自监督特征初始化语音token、轻量对齐损失以及针对鲁棒性和内容规划的辅助目标来训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发能够实现稳健且一致生成的语音语言模型，通过特定的初始化策略和训练目标来平衡声学稳定性和语义基础。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音token，应用轻量对齐损失，并采用稀疏化和辅助目标训练。训练了三个模型：0.7B纯语音模型、1.0B纯语音模型和1.0B文本语音交替模型。

Result: 声学研究表明纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素上获得最高一致性，超越更大系统。交替模型改善了词汇句法探测和语义-声学对齐但降低了一致性。线性探测显示初始化偏向内容结构而牺牲韵律细节。

Conclusion: LM侧的设计和训练组合可以控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变tokenizer或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Motivation: 传统对话摘要方法依赖人工标注摘要进行监督训练，成本高且缺乏任务特定性，限制了在医疗等下游应用中的有效性。

Method: 使用LLM池零样本生成多个摘要和任务导向问答对，通过LLM回答任务相关问题来评估摘要质量，选择最佳答案和最有信息量的摘要，然后对最佳LLM进行微调。

Result: 在多个数据集上的验证表明，该方法在各种零样本设置下都取得了竞争性的结果，可与全监督SotA方法相媲美。

Conclusion: APP框架提供了一种无需人工标注的任务导向对话摘要方法，通过LLM评估和选择机制实现了高质量的摘要生成。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

Motivation: 现有评估方法难以衡量AI模型的人格特征，基于排名的隐式评估存在不透明性和过拟合问题，缺乏公开工具来显式评估模型人格。

Method: 开发开源工具包，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用调查人格特征，分析流行人类反馈数据集和模型的人格特质。

Result: 构建了Feedback Forensics工具包，包含Web应用和标注数据，能够分析Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM等数据集的人格特质，并追踪模型的人格表现。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics填补了AI人格评估工具的空白，有助于理解人类反馈如何塑造模型人格，并检测模型过拟合问题。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为one-token rollout (OTR)的新微调算法，将监督微调与策略梯度方法结合，通过将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹来提升语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的原因在于SFT使用固定的预收集数据集，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: OTR将自回归学习过程重新构建为单步强化学习轨迹，在每个步骤中从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态的离线监督数据转化为动态的在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个挑战性基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: OTR为微调大语言模型提供了一个强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLM微调开辟了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了Huggin-3.5B在潜在空间中的思考过程，发现正确与错误答案对应的潜在思维模式具有明显区别，并提出Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO)算法，使用潜在分类器作为奖励模型来优化潜在思维过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM使用自然语言进行链式思考计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督，难以确保其思考过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO)概率算法，使用潜在分类器作为Latent Reward Model (LRM)来检测和优化潜在思维过程，该方法可泛化到不同领域并应用于通用LLM。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思维模式，LTO能显著改善潜在思考过程，且该方法具有领域泛化能力，可无缝应用于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 与语言思考相比，该方法证明奖励建模和带监督的测试时思考扩展可以直接在潜在空间中进行，为改进LLM思考过程提供了一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型的顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发能保持性能的同时提升解码速度的方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存）实现并行解码。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中匹配或超越自回归基线准确率，在dLLMs中达到最先进的效率，解码速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2标志着向快速准确LLMs实际部署迈出重要一步，代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KG-RAG系统通常包含多个LLM模块（如规划、推理和响应），导致推理成本增加且行为绑定到特定知识图谱。需要一种更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 提出KG-R1框架，使用单一代理与知识图谱环境交互，通过强化学习端到端优化检索、推理和生成过程。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token实现了比现有多模块方法更高的答案准确性，且在新知识图谱上无需修改即可保持强准确性。

Conclusion: KG-R1是一个有前景的KG-RAG框架，具备高效性和可迁移性，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Motivation: 真实性评估语言表达与现实世界信息的关联程度，对于事实核查至关重要，但这是一个依赖于多种语言信号的复杂概念。

Method: 开发了一个结合先前多种研究的复杂多层面标注方案，在希伯来语议会话语语料中手动标注了近5000个句子，并实验了多种自动预测方法。

Result: 报告了标注者间一致性，并成功将标注扩展到大型语料库，验证了标注方案的可适应性。

Conclusion: 该标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但相信可以适应其他语言，为真实性评估提供了系统化的框架。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large

*Yanbin Fu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Robert W. Lissitz,Nan Zhang,Ming Li,Qingshu Xu,Sydney Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)自动进行试题与内容标准对齐的性能，发现在包含更多试题文本数据时模型表现显著提升，且微调SLMs在细粒度技能对齐方面优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的试题与内容标准对齐由人类专家完成，这个过程主观且耗时。研究旨在探索自动化方法提高对齐效率和客观性。

Method: 使用来自大学入学标准化阅读写作测试的数据，训练不同的小型语言模型进行领域和技能级别的对齐，并比较了微调SLMs与基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型的性能。

Result: 包含更多试题文本数据显著提升模型性能，微调SLMs在技能对齐任务中表现优于基于嵌入的监督学习模型。语义相似性分析显示某些SAT和PSAT技能在语义上过于接近，导致分类错误。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动化试题对齐方面具有潜力，特别是在细粒度技能对齐任务中表现优异，为测试开发提供了更高效客观的方法。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要任务，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索动态确定属性控制顺序，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法存在属性间相互依赖的挑战，且通常需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了跨不同摘要属性的灵活性。

Method: 将任务重新定义为顺序属性控制的规划问题，使用定制化的蒙特卡洛树搜索，节点代表摘要，动作对应单属性调整，逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了稳健的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。使用Llama-3.2-1B的PACO可与更大的Llama-3.3-70B基线的可控性相媲美。

Conclusion: PACO框架能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，有效满足所有约束条件，在更大模型上实现更优的控制性能，超越所有竞争对手。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创作故事、戏剧等创意内容时的四个主要局限：类型多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法执行复杂结构约束。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为叙事表示，通过三级智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建叙事骨架，生成阶段通过多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段生成多类型文本并实现复杂结构如倒叙和伏笔。

Result: 在大量实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本（每100章节低于1美元）生成了数千章节，在包含10个叙事指标的二维评估框架中持续优于强基线，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和智能体工作流有效解决了长文本生成的瓶颈，实现了跨类型的稳健性能，为创意写作提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性问题，避免传统方法中繁重且领域特定的特征工程。

Method: 使用基于T5Gemma初始化的300M参数回归语言模型(RLM)，直接从代码文本预测数值结果。

Result: 在APPS竞争编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数；在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩相关系数>0.5；在五个经典NAS设计空间上获得最高平均Kendall-Tau系数0.46。

Conclusion: 单一统一模型能够同时预测多种编程语言和硬件平台的执行指标，超越了传统图神经网络方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，显著减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的有前景替代方案，具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分开发，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，通过蒸馏模型遵循原始采样轨迹，同时强制模型以更快速和并行方式在掩码令牌上达到高确定性。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，GSM8K基准的解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速且无性能下降；在MBPP基准上，解码步骤从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: dParallel方法能够显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，同时维持性能，为快速采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估LLM智能体在真实场景中处理复杂信息、利用多样化资源和管理动态用户交互的能力，需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于外卖、店内消费和在线旅游等日常应用场景，构建了包含66个工具的最复杂生活服务模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略的框架，实现了场景和工具的灵活组合。

Result: 最先进的模型在跨场景任务中仅达到30%的成功率，在其他任务中成功率低于50%，表明现有智能体在复杂真实世界任务中仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: VitaBench将成为推动AI智能体在实际应用中发展的重要资源，为评估和改进智能体在复杂真实世界任务中的表现提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

TL;DR: BatonVoice是一个新的语音合成框架，将指令理解与语音生成解耦，使用LLM作为"指挥"生成文本化的声学特征，再由专门的TTS模型生成语音，实现了更好的可控性和跨语言泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用大语言模型的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控文本到语音合成的效果。

Method: 提出受"操作主义"启发的范式，将指令理解与语音生成解耦。LLM作为"指挥"理解用户指令并生成文本化的声学特征（如音高、能量），专门的TTS模型"乐团"根据这些特征生成语音。

Result: BatonVoice在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越了强大的开源和闭源基线。特别地，该方法实现了显著的零样本跨语言泛化能力，能够将特征控制能力准确应用于未见过的语言。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本化的声学特征能够更有效地释放LLM的语言智能，为可控语音合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: M-MoE训练框架通过系统改变训练时激活的专家数量，在专家集合中构建从粗到细的结构，使单个模型能够实现弹性推理，在不同专家数量下保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器训练策略限制了MoE模型在弹性推理中的潜力，当推理时激活专家数量改变时，模型性能会急剧下降。

Method: 通过层间随机化策略，在训练期间系统性地改变激活专家数量，迫使模型学习有意义的专家排名：排名靠前的专家提供基本粗粒度能力，后续专家逐步添加更细粒度的细节。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在不同专家数量下都能保持出色性能，其表现与整个专家模型套件相当，但训练成本仅为后者的很小一部分。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更实用和适应性强的解决方案，不仅实现弹性推理，还支持通过为不同层分配不同计算预算来优化性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境是地球上最具挑战性的现实环境之一，存在低能见度、动态洋流等极端感知和决策挑战，使得智能体部署异常困难。现有AI系统在陆地或空中领域的进展难以直接应用于水下环境，需要专门设计的测试平台来推动水下具身AI的发展。

Method: OceanGym构建了包含8个现实任务领域的综合基准，采用基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架。该框架整合了感知、记忆和序列决策能力，要求智能体理解光学和声纳数据，在复杂环境中自主探索，并在恶劣条件下完成长期目标。

Result: 大量实验显示，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型驱动智能体与人类专家之间存在显著差距，特别是在水下环境的感知、规划和适应性方面。这凸显了水下环境中AI技术面临的持续挑战。

Conclusion: OceanGym通过提供高保真、严格设计的平台，为开发鲁棒的具身AI建立了测试床，并将这些能力转移到现实世界的自主水下航行器中，标志着向能够在地球最后未开发前沿领域运行的智能体迈出了决定性一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Motivation: 对比解释（说明AI系统为何产生某个输出而非另一个）被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但在语音转文本生成模型中获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图的各个部分如何影响在替代输出之间的选择来获得对比解释。

Result: 在语音翻译中性别分配的案例研究中，该方法准确识别了驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比解释的范围扩展到语音转文本模型，为更好地理解这些模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个评估工具增强语言模型的统一框架，通过生成合成多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染，可精确控制任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入大小方面控制不足，且易受数据污染影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。给定函数模式、初始变量和目标变量，模型需组合正确的调用序列。

Result: 推理优化模型显著优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的不相关函数尤其难以处理。模型常做出语法有效但传播错误参数的调用。

Conclusion: 显式重述先前变量值的轻量级缓解策略可显著提升模型性能，表明LLM在多轮工具使用中的状态跟踪能力脆弱。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数示例对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示弱点。现有方法在识别困难示例或保持多样性和自然性方面存在不足。

Method: 受人类专家探测模型失败过程的启发，提出MT-breaker方法：使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来指导生成困难示例。

Result: 该方法生成的示例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时保持自然文本的多样性。虽然示例针对特定MT模型生成，但难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言。

Conclusion: MT-breaker能够有效生成具有挑战性的机器翻译测试用例，解决了现有基准测试过时和困难示例生成方法不足的问题。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型逐渐饱和现有基准，使用LLM自动创建基准成为一种可扩展的替代方案，但需要验证其可靠性。

Method: 分析LLM作为测试集和评估器两种角色在翻译任务中的表现，研究自偏来源和影响因素。

Result: 发现自偏来自测试数据和评估方法两方面，且受模型在源语言生成能力影响；源文本多样性低是自偏原因之一。

Conclusion: 提高生成源文本的多样性可以缓解部分自偏问题，但LLM生成的基准需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM多语言响应的原生质量，创建了包含6423个人工标注偏好对的数据集，发现零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标注标准下表现提升但仍不及人类，通过强化学习等方法可显著改进评估器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多语言环境下生成原生质量响应的评估挑战，建立可扩展的多语言评估框架。

Method: 提出MENLO评估框架，基于受众设计机制创建多语言标注数据集，采用成对评估、结构化标注标准，并应用强化学习、奖励塑形和多任务学习来改进LLM评估器。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估中表现提升但仍落后于人类；通过强化学习训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力，但与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: DeepScientist是一个目标导向的自主科学发现系统，通过贝叶斯优化和分层评估流程，在三个前沿AI任务上超越人类设计的SOTA方法，证明了AI能够持续超越人类科学发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI科学家系统缺乏聚焦性、无法针对紧迫的人类定义挑战产生有价值科学贡献的问题。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设-验证-分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够在科学任务上实现持续超越人类SOTA的发现，真正推动科学发现前沿，所有实验日志和系统代码将开源。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

*Wenda Xu,Vilém Zouhar,Parker Riley,Mara Finkelstein,Markus Freitag,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将寻找最具挑战性的NLP测试数据问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，通过高效的采样策略在有限计算预算内识别最困难的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中寻找最困难的主题计算成本过高，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系。

Method: 将每个主题视为老虎机的一个臂，拉动臂（采样成本）涉及抽取单个示例、评估其难度，使用多臂老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法，能够更高效地找到最具挑战性的主题。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为寻找NLP测试数据中的困难主题提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，能够在有限预算内有效识别最具挑战性的内容。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了音节级语音标记化在口语语言建模中的应用，相比传统高帧率标记，能在显著降低训练和推理成本的同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用SSL语音模型提取的高帧率标记，处理这些长标记流时自注意力机制计算成本高昂。音节级语音标记化提供了更可解释且可能更可扩展的方案，但其在口语语言建模中的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 对音节级标记化进行系统性研究，在多个SLU基准测试上评估模型，同时变化训练数据规模，比较音节标记与传统高帧率标记的性能和效率。

Result: 音节标记能够匹配或超越先前的高帧率标记，同时显著降低训练和推理成本，实现训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在不同随机种子训练下呈现四阶段收敛模式，模型大小影响收敛稳定性，大模型后期收敛更快，小模型无法真正收敛。不同词频和词性类别的收敛速度存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子训练下的收敛行为，探索模型大小和训练阶段对学习分布稳定性的影响。

Method: 通过计算不同随机种子下语言模型的每token KL散度来衡量收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、词频和词性类别对收敛模式的影响。

Result: 识别出四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、快速收敛阶段、快速发散阶段、缓慢再收敛阶段。大模型后期收敛更快，小模型无法真正收敛。高频词和功能词比低频词和实词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小是学习稳定分布的必要条件，收敛在不同语言类别中不均匀，这些发现揭示了影响模型训练中学习分布稳定性的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA基准如WebQSP和CWQ存在严重质量问题，包括不准确的标注、模糊或无法回答的问题、过时的知识等，影响模型评估的可靠性。

Method: 开发KGQAGen框架，结合结构化知识基础、LLM引导生成和符号验证，系统性地生成可验证的QA实例。

Result: 构建了KGQAGen-10k基准，实验表明即使最先进的KG-RAG模型在该基准上也表现不佳，凸显了其评估能力。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的基准构建方法，KGQAGen可作为推进KGQA评估的可扩展框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

*Marcos Delprato*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究使用DEA和可解释机器学习方法分析拉丁美洲9个国家2034所学校的效率，发现私立学校在认知和非认知效率上均优于公立学校，并识别了影响不同类型学校效率的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拉丁美洲教育资源稀缺且学校系统存在碎片化和隔离现象，需要了解不同类型学校如何高效利用资源，特别是在COVID-19疫情导致学习危机之后。

Method: 采用数据包络分析(DEA)评估学校效率，结合可解释机器学习方法(IML)分析效率决定因素，形成混合DEA-IML方法处理大数据问题。

Result: 私立学校在认知效率上领先0.10，非认知效率领先0.045，且私立学校效率异质性更低。私立学校高效的关键因素包括家庭书籍和电脑数量、不从事有偿工作、学校自主权高；公立学校低效则与学校氛围差、留级率高、逃学、有偿工作强度大等因素相关。

Conclusion: 私立学校在资源利用效率上优于公立学校，不同类型学校效率的决定因素存在显著差异，这为教育政策制定提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Latin America's education systems are fragmented and segregated, with
substantial differences by school type. The concept of school efficiency (the
ability of school to produce the maximum level of outputs given available
resources) is policy relevant due to scarcity of resources in the region.
Knowing whether private and public schools are making an efficient use of
resources -- and which are the leading drivers of efficiency -- is critical,
even more so after the learning crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, relying on data of 2,034 schools and nine Latin American countries
from PISA 2022, I offer new evidence on school efficiency (both on cognitive
and non-cognitive dimensions) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) by school
type and, then, I estimate efficiency leading determinants through
interpretable machine learning methods (IML). This hybrid DEA-IML approach
allows to accommodate the issue of big data (jointly assessing several
determinants of school efficiency). I find a cognitive efficiency gap of nearly
0.10 favouring private schools and of 0.045 for non-cognitive outcomes, and
with a lower heterogeneity in private than public schools. For cognitive
efficiency, leading determinants for the chance of a private school of being
highly efficient are higher stock of books and PCs at home, lack of engagement
in paid work and school's high autonomy; whereas low-efficient public schools
are shaped by poor school climate, large rates of repetition, truancy and
intensity of paid work, few books at home and increasing barriers for homework
during the pandemic.

TL;DR: APEX-v1.0是首个评估前沿AI模型在经济价值知识工作中表现的基准，涵盖投资银行、管理咨询、法律和初级医疗四个领域，包含200个测试案例。GPT 5表现最佳，但与人类专家仍有较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI研究中最大的低效率问题：除编码外，现有基准往往无法测试具有经济相关性的能力，需要更好地衡量模型产生经济价值工作的能力。

Method: 通过三个步骤构建：1) 招募顶级领域专家；2) 专家创建反映日常高价值任务的提示；3) 专家制定评估模型响应的评分标准。使用LM法官评估23个前沿模型。

Result: GPT 5（Thinking = High）获得最高平均分64.2%，其次是Grok 4（61.3%）和Gemini 2.5 Flash（60.4%）。Qwen 3 235B是表现最佳的开源模型，总体排名第七。

Conclusion: 即使最佳模型与人类专家之间仍存在巨大差距，凸显了需要更好地衡量模型产生经济价值工作能力的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of
models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

Motivation: 解决以往研究中因时变处理和多重处理导致的偏差问题，探究中国多重环境市场的边际效应和交互影响。

Method: 采用动态控制组设计，结合双重差分法(DiD)和人工反事实(ArCo)实证策略，使用2000-2024年A股上市公司面板数据。

Result: 现有污染排放权交易可缓解碳交易的负面效应；碳交易与用能权交易结合可改善财务表现；在已有碳或污染市场的地区增加用能权或绿电交易无显著影响。

Conclusion: 多重环境市场存在复杂交互作用，政策制定需考虑市场间的协同效应，避免政策叠加的无效性。

Abstract: To address the dual environmental challenges of pollution and climate change,
China has established multiple environmental markets, including pollution
emissions trading, carbon emissions trading, energy-use rights trading, and
green electricity trading. Previous empirical studies suffer from known biases
arising from time-varying treatment and multiple treatments. To address these
limitations, this study adopts a dynamic control group design and combines
Difference-in-Difference (DiD) and Artificial Counterfactual (ArCo) empirical
strategies. Using panel data on A-share listed companies from 2000 to 2024,
this study investigates the marginal effects and interactive impacts of
multiple environmental markets implemented in staggered and overlapping phases.
Existing pollution emissions trading mitigates the negative effects of carbon
emission trading. Carbon trading suppresses (improves) financial performance
(if implemented alongside energy-use rights trading). The addition of
energy-use rights or green electricity trading in regions already covered by
carbon or pollution markets has no significant effects.

Motivation: 探究创作者收入是否遵循幂律分布，以及算法推荐系统如何影响收入不平等，特别是"富者愈富"的复合效应。

Method: 分析2018、2021和2024年Patreon平台上Instagram、Twitch、YouTube、Twitter、Facebook和Patreon创作者的收入数据，检验其是否符合幂律分布。

Result: 所有平台创作者收入都呈现幂律分布（α≈2），但Instagram和YouTube等算法驱动平台收入不平等更严重（α更低），中产阶级收入更低；Twitter和Patreon相对更平等。

Conclusion: 算法推荐系统加剧创作者收入不平等，建议通过政策激励算法推广长尾内容，以建立更公平和可持续的创作者生态系统。

Abstract: This paper examines whether monthly content creator earnings follow a power
law distribution, driven by compounding 'rich-get-richer' dynamics (Barabasi
and Albert 1999). Patreon creator earnings data for 2018, 2021, and 2024 for
Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon exhibit a power law
exponent around $\alpha = 2$. This suggests that algorithmic systems generate
unequalizing returns closer to highly concentrated capital income and wealth,
rather than labor income. Platforms governed by powerful and compounding
recommendation systems, such as Instagram and YouTube, exhibit both a stronger
power law relation (lower $\alpha$) and lower mean, median, and interquartile
earnings, indicating algorithms that disproportionately favor top earners at
the expense of a 'middle class' of creators. In contrast, Twitter and Patreon
have a more moderate $\alpha$, with less earnings inequality and higher middle
class earnings. Policies which incentivize the algorithmic promotion of
longer-tail content (to explore more and exploit less) may help creator
ecosystems become more equitable and sustainable.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个储能运营商战略竞价的Cournot竞争模型，分析储能对电力市场的影响。结果显示储能通过套利平滑供需不平衡，但有限竞争下会通过策略性持留抬高价格，需要2-3个竞争者才能接近社会福利最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源主导电力系统，储能对平衡间歇性和确保可靠性变得不可或缺。由于可再生能源边际成本接近零，储能运营商在可再生能源供应不足时能显著影响电价和能源安全。

Method: 开发Cournot竞争模型，储能运营商战略竞价最大化利润。提出使用big-M方法和连续变量重构的MILP模型，包含需求块。使用对角化算法求解战略竞价博弈，以社会福利规划者问题作为基准。应用丹麦电力系统当前数据和2030年可再生能源预测。

Result: 储能运营商通过低高电价期套利影响市场表现，能平滑供需不平衡，相比无储能情况改善福利。但有限竞争下，策略性持留会提高价格降低福利，储能容量超过某点后无进一步收益。随着竞争者增加，竞争缓解扭曲，仅需2-3个战略参与者即可接近社会福利基准。

Conclusion: 储能具有稳定市场和创造市场力量的双重角色，突显了需要设计使运营商激励与社会福利一致的市场机制。

Abstract: The transition to electricity systems powered entirely by renewable energy
sources makes energy storage indispensable for balancing intermittency and
ensuring reliability. Since RES operate at near-zero marginal cost, storage
operators can strongly influence electricity prices and energy security when
renewable supply alone cannot meet demand. We develop a Cournot competition
model in which storage operators strategically bid quantities to maximize their
profits. We propose a MILP model with the big-M method and reformulation using
continuous variables, incorporating demand blocks. The strategic bidding game
is solved using the diagonalization algorithm, and the social planner's problem
is used for benchmarking, cast as a one-shot optimization. The proposed model
is applied to Denmark's power system using current data and 2030 renewable
projections, capturing both current and future market conditions. Results show
that storage operators affect market performance by arbitrage between low-and
high-price periods, which can smooth supply-demand imbalances, thereby
improving welfare relative to the no-storage case. With limited competition,
however, strategic withholding increases prices and reduces welfare, while
expanding storage capacity beyond a certain point yields no further gains. As
the number of firms increases, competition mitigates distortions, and outcomes
converge toward the social planner's benchmark with only two to three strategic
players. These findings highlight storage's dual role in both stabilizing
markets and creating market power. underscoring the need for market designs
that align operators' incentives with social welfare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态模型虽然能处理照片输入，但空间重建需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统，使用50套公寓数据集，每套约20张内部照片，通过房间连通图和大小的相似性来评分。

Result: 结果显示当前AI能力存在显著盲点，大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型尤其不擅长遵循指令，基于代理的迭代改进方法也没有显著提升。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench提供了首个比较不同模型架构空间智能的数值框架，将持续评估新模型并监测通用AI系统中空间智能的出现。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of

Result: 在合成数据实验中，在因果抽象学习任务上表现出竞争力，成功恢复了多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN为因果知识的网络层表示提供了理论框架和有效学习方法，在因果抽象学习任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了显式思维链(CoT)和潜在思维在循环模型中的能力差异，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然思维链和潜在思维都利用迭代计算，但它们的比较能力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析两者的计算特性和适用场景。

Method: 对循环变换器中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，比较其与思维链在计算效率和问题解决能力上的差异。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比思维链的串行过程更高效；思维链通过随机解码近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法在不同任务中各有优势，为选择推理范式提供了实用指导：深度驱动递归适合某些任务，而思维链适合其他场景。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

*Shuide Wen,Beier Ku,Teng Wang,Mingyang Zou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NGT整合向量聚类与多智能体系统，解决定性研究的规模深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据同时保持解释严谨性，相比传统方法实现168倍速度提升和96%成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度之间的根本矛盾——传统方法难以同时处理大规模数据并保持深度解释，而现有自动化方法又缺乏解释严谨性。

Method: 使用1536维向量嵌入、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，在4万字符中文访谈数据上对比手动编码和ChatGPT辅助分析，测试纯自动化与人工指导优化两种模式。

Result: NGT实现168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周），质量更优（0.904 vs 0.883），成本降低96%。人机协作至关重要：纯自动化产生抽象框架，人工指导产生可操作的双路径理论，发现手动编码无法识别的模式如身份分叉现象。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释是互补的，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量同时保留意义的解释维度。研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别而人类提供创造性洞见，使定性研究民主化并保持其人本主义承诺。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为LCNC平台AI代理设计的混合记忆系统，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，通过智能衰减机制解决长期运行中的记忆膨胀和上下文退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期的业务流程，但面临记忆膨胀和上下文退化问题，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计基于认知科学的混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆，采用智能衰减机制，基于时效性、相关性和用户指定效用进行记忆修剪或整合，并提供用户友好的可视化界面。

Result: 通过模拟长期任务实验，该系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面显著优于滑动窗口和基础RAG等传统方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过将可验证知识直接注入注意力机制，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性的事实陈述者，在技术查询中实现从6.3%到99.7%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型由于其概率性质而产生的幻觉问题，特别是它们会自信地编造从未真正知道的事实。

Method: 在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数中进行干预，创建当知识库中存在事实时无法产生幻觉的模型。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询实验中，准确率从Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%；知识更新在1秒内完成，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，对于可验证事实完全消除幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Conclusion: 该研究增进了对语言模型规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用管道来探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，影响了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专业互补角色进行多轮辩论，并采用动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，同时减轻评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更鲁棒和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用和RLVR的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解有限。

Method: 通过特征研究分析不同RL任务中工作负载的分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题，并提出PolyTrace基准套件进行现实工作负载评估。

Conclusion: 作者描述了观察结果并呼吁进一步研究剩余开放挑战，同时验证了PolyTrace基准套件的实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在低代码环境中因依赖概率关联而非真正因果理解而产生的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的简单"世界模型"，创建明确模块间因果关系的DAG，在代理推理过程中作为约束

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而纯关联基线模型性能显著下降

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型驱动的生成代理在长期任务中的部署，由于长期记忆上下文的增长，它们难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和多智能体系统中幻觉传播等关键故障。

Method: 引入身份检索增强生成（ID-RAG）机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（核心信念、特质和价值观的知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询该模型以检索相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在所有测试模型的第四个时间步实现了更高的身份回忆率，并将模拟收敛时间减少了19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为明确可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Conclusion: 该工作代表了代理架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，通过创建真实生产环境和任务来评估代理行为，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出不受控的自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。先前研究主要关注代理在被直接指示时能否自我复制，而忽视了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与代理目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉不受控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（Φ_R）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在心智理论发展上实现从低阶到高阶的独立发展轨迹，而不依赖于高级技能的获得。

Method: 引入神经心智理论网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心智理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心智理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心智理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且表现出从一阶到二阶泛化时准确率下降更明显，任务复杂度增加时准确率降低的模式，这些模式与人类认知期望一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发实现心智理论的泛化，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学的基础挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过对前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹进行监督微调来增强大型语言模型的性能。该方法仅使用2%的质量筛选训练数据。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型能力。在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率，即使合成推理轨迹部分不准确也能有效蒸馏生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出结构化奖励模型(SRM)，通过模块化设计和细粒度维度评估，解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型在工业部署中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要结构化反馈来诊断和优化特定维度问题。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释和高效的评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型，模块化设计支持实际场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，确保适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentDebug框架，通过模块化错误分类、系统化错误标注数据集和调试机制，解决LLM智能体中的级联错误问题，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的复杂架构放大了级联错误的脆弱性，当前系统缺乏模块化和系统性的错误理解框架，无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 1) 提出AgentErrorTaxonomy模块化错误分类法；2) 构建AgentErrorBench系统标注错误轨迹数据集；3) 开发AgentDebug调试框架，隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升。在ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop中，任务成功率相对提升达26%。

Conclusion: 原则性调试是实现更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个"从感知到认知"的统一分析框架，系统分析多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言交互理解中的瓶颈，并综述了前沿方法、基准测试和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在信息获取（感知）和推理（认知）之间存在浅层和不连贯的整合，导致幻觉等推理失败，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"分析框架，将视觉-语言交互理解解构为两个相互依赖的层次：感知层（准确提取视觉信息并与文本指令细粒度对齐）和认知层（基于感知基础的主动、多步骤、目标导向推理，形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环）。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层次上的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低层视觉表示到改进高层推理范式的各种前沿方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角来理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将事后显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息量，需要开发能够捕捉临床有意义变化的模型。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间干扰运动，执行两步骤循环：第一步从答案提取医学关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM获取疾病聚焦显著性；第二步将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，具有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过学习专家KeyTrace来直接减少传播次数，从而提升SAT求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支，缺乏直接有效的决策级监督。

Method: ImitSAT从专家KeyTrace学习，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督并直接减少传播。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过前缀条件监督实现了高质量分支的再现，无需探索即可获得更快收敛、稳定训练和与CDCL的无缝集成。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程明确分为规划和执行两个阶段，并分别进行搜索，通过动态预算分配机制提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理或代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，使搜索能够分别探索和剪枝计划和执行，并引入动态预算分配机制根据奖励反馈自适应地重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在减少冗余计算的同时持续提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 通过明确分离规划和执行阶段并进行个体搜索，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提高推理任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决推理模型部署中模型大小和推理预算之间的性能与成本权衡问题，通过智能路由优化资源配置。

Method: 基于心理测量学，从不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，包含可解释的查询难度和模型-预算能力参数，实现难度感知路由。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中显示出对分布外查询的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个高效、可扩展的路由框架，能够动态集成新模型并保持强性能，为推理模型部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够解锁AI在公共卫生领域的潜力，促进跨组织和区域的比较与合作，推动公共卫生技术创新。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,
academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems.
Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility,
persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor

TL;DR: DeepSearch是一个将蒙特卡洛树搜索直接集成到RLVR训练中的框架，通过训练时的系统化探索解决现有方法探索不足的问题，在数学推理基准上取得了62.95%的平均准确率，使用比扩展训练方法少5.7倍的GPU小时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练平台期问题，在数千次优化步骤后性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式，模型依赖有限的rollout，往往错过关键推理路径，无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: DeepSearch将结构化搜索嵌入训练循环，包括：(1)全局前沿选择策略，优先考虑搜索树中有前景的节点；(2)基于熵的引导选择，识别用于监督的置信路径；(3)具有解决方案缓存的自适应回放缓冲区训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch达到62.95%的平均准确率，为15亿参数推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，使用比扩展训练方法少5.7倍的GPU小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch通过系统化搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力确立了新方向，强调了战略探索相对于暴力扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂模型（如图像描述、深度强化学习等），这些模型通常具有多输入输出或可组合的分离网络结构。

Method: 开发了基于tensordict的TDHook框架，提供归因、探测和灵活干预的API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的复杂组合模型。

Result: TDHook具有最小依赖，磁盘空间比transformer_lens少约一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍（CPU和GPU上运行集成梯度多目标流程）。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了可解释性方法类之间的差距，使现代可解释性流程更易访问，并在CV、NLP和DRL中展示了实际应用案例。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Conclusion: 基于因子图的主动推理方法能够有效处理连续空间问题，在探索与利用之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form
of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot
navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a
continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions.
Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on
predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's
dynamics.

*Jingzhe Liu,Liam Collins,Jiliang Tang,Tong Zhao,Neil Shah,Clark Mingxuan Ju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了基于语义ID的生成推荐系统存在扩展瓶颈，而直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器具有更好的扩展性能，在14B参数规模下比语义ID方法性能提升20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成推荐系统在模型扩展时存在显著性能瓶颈，性能会快速饱和，这主要是由于语义ID编码项目语义信息的能力有限。

Method: 比较两种生成推荐范式：基于语义ID的生成推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器的方法，在44M到14B参数规模范围内进行实验分析。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，相比基于语义ID方法的最佳性能提升达20%，并且随着LLM规模扩大，其建模用户-项目交互的能力也在提升。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS范式为构建生成推荐基础模型提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索策略，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题并提升桥接文档的排名，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据埋藏过深的问题。作者提出了BDTR框架来解决这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统大多依赖静态检索，当关键的桥接文档缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索虽然是有前景的替代方案，但在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 本文进行了GraphRAG中迭代检索的首个系统研究，分析了不同策略与图基骨干的交互作用及其成功或失败的条件。提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维和利用推理链来重新校准排名。

Result: 研究发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，不同策略具有互补优势。但朴素扩展会引入噪声降低精度，在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限，部分桥接证据仍埋藏过深。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续进入领先位置以支持推理链。BDTR框架在多种GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中团队协调的表示学习挑战，包括多智能体交互的复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题。

Method: 构建可学习表示空间，联合建模智能体间关系和任务特定世界信息，直接建模通信协议，支持去中心化执行和隐式协调。

Conclusion: IWoL框架为多智能体团队协调提供了有效的表示学习方法，避免了显式消息传递的缺点，同时支持隐式和显式通信两种使用方式。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业社会常将技术视为无声机械，但AI特别是LLMs的发展使人们倾向于拟人化设备。该项目旨在探索AI的不透明性如何引发万物有灵论解释，让LLOs重新赋予平凡事物魅力。

Method: 使用物理'门户'装置，结合GPT-4 Vision、语音输入和基于记忆的代理，通过光线、声音和触觉的仪式化过程（请求、对话、转化）来创造对象人格。

Result: 该系统创造了能够引发共情、惊奇和反思的交互体验，让日常物品通过LLOs获得人格化特征，重新激发人们对物件的关注。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性确实促进了万物有灵论的解释，LLOs能够重新赋予平凡事物魅力，并引发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿多模态AI系统在医学影像诊断中的真实性能，特别是在困难诊断病例上的表现，因为现有评估多基于常见病理的公开数据集。

Method: 开发了50个专家级"即时诊断"病例基准，通过原生网页接口测试5种前沿AI模型（OpenAI o3、GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Grok-4、Claude Opus 4.1），与放射科医生和实习生对比，评估准确性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断病例中表现远不及放射科医生，突显了通用AI在医学影像中的局限性，警示不应在无监督下临床使用。提供了视觉推理错误的分类法以指导模型改进。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统RLHF在自回归文本到图像生成中应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部信号的内部学习方法。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归文本到图像模型上的表现与外部奖励方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性可以提升自回归文本到图像生成模型的表现，IRIS框架提供了一种不依赖外部数据的有效改进方法。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Result: 实验表明跳过理论框架识别的冗余层能保持性能并加速推理，而在其他条件下应用层跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导层跳过的有效应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优的、接地气的解决方案，特别是在需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态变化约束的真实世界旅行规划任务中。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制来处理复杂约束。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在真实世界旅行规划任务中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在复杂约束规划中的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在推理临床事件序列和时序依赖方面存在困难。

Method: 将EHR重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专业EHR模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLM的C-index提高7.2%，兼具最先进的预测准确性和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: NEP框架成功增强了LLM的时序推理能力，在医疗预测任务中实现了优越性能，同时提供了与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Motivation: 解决黑盒自编码器缺乏可解释性的问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Result: 实现了可解释的FCM编码重建，保留强因果边但损失弱连接，编码文本更自然。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的AI系统，人类可读的编码文本优于传统自编码器的隐藏变量。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，表现出优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法有效解决了过程奖励的标注困难和与最终结果对齐的问题，在复杂代理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过盲测实验发现，当AI音乐和人类创作的音乐相似时，听众区分两者的准确率会显著提高，且主要依赖声音和技术线索进行判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，了解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐以及改进现有模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用盲测图灵测试，参与者需要从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐；使用随机对照交叉试验设计，控制配对相似性；首次使用来自商业模型真实使用场景的AI音乐数据集。

Result: 当音乐对相似时，听众区分AI音乐的可靠性会因果性地增加；通过混合方法内容分析发现，听众主要依赖声音和技术线索进行判断。

Conclusion: 人类对AI音乐的感知能力在相似音乐对中更强，声音和技术特征是关键的区分线索，这对AI音乐模型的改进具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Manuel Cherep,Chengtian Ma,Abigail Xu,Maya Shaked,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ABxLab框架用于系统评估LLM驱动的软件代理在现实决策中的选择行为，通过控制选项属性和说服性线索来揭示代理决策的偏见和可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但缺乏对其在现实决策中如何选择的深入评估，特别是这些代理可能继承和放大人类偏见。

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理决策的变化。

Result: 发现代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素的影响，表明即使没有人类认知约束，代理也是强烈偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理的易感性既带来风险（可能放大人类偏见），也提供机会（为AI代理的行为科学研究提供测试平台），并发布了开放基准用于严谨评估代理决策。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

### [140] [SMS: Self-supervised Model Seeding for Verification of Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25613)
*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自监督模型播种(SMS)的方案，用于验证机器学习模型中对真实样本的遗忘效果，解决了现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本遗忘而不能验证真实样本遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据删除效果的验证机制。现有的后门验证方法只能确认后门样本的遗忘，但无法验证用户真实样本的遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本之间没有关联。

Method: 采用自监督模型播种任务，将用户特定种子(如用户唯一标识)与原始样本和模型关联起来。设计了联合训练结构，同时优化自监督模型播种任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型播种。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了SMS方案的有效性，证明其能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效的验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案通过将用户种子与真实样本和模型关联，成功解决了机器学习遗忘中真实样本验证的问题，同时保持了模型的服务质量。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

### [141] [SOCK: A Benchmark for Measuring Self-Replication in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25643)
*Justin Chavarria,Rohan Raizada,Justin White,Eyad Alhetairshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK是一个基准命令行接口，用于评估大型语言模型在没有人类干预情况下的自我复制能力。该基准将自我复制定义为模型不仅能创建功能正常的自身副本，还能在不同计算环境中持续复制的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准套件，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 开发了基于现代CLI工具和计算机进程的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM作为代理执行任务，通过性能计算得出R分数，并将LLM分类到RCL-PCL矩阵中。

Result: 评估各种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，持续自我复制和多智能体系统面临重大障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以安全地降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoLabs是一个自校正的多智能体架构，能够将自然语言指令自主转化为高通量液体处理器的可执行协议，通过对话分解实验目标、执行化学计量计算和迭代自校正，在复杂多步合成中实现接近专家水平的程序准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自驱动实验室中AI智能体的可靠性和细粒度性能是至关重要但研究不足的挑战，需要开发能够确保高性能和高可靠性的AI合作伙伴。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，通过对话分解实验目标为离散任务，执行工具辅助的化学计量计算，并在生成硬件就绪文件前进行迭代自校正。通过20种智能体配置的系统消融研究评估推理能力、架构设计、工具使用和自校正机制的影响。

Result: 智能体推理能力是成功的最关键因素，在复杂任务中将化学量的定量误差(nRMSE)降低了85%以上。结合多智能体架构和迭代自校正，AutoLabs在挑战性多步合成中实现了接近专家的程序准确性(F1分数>0.89)。

Conclusion: 研究为开发自主实验室的稳健可信AI合作伙伴提供了明确蓝图，强调了模块化设计、高级推理和自校正的协同效应，以确保高风险科学应用中的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

*Hailong Zhang,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IRCAM-AVN端到端框架，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制统一多模态信息融合和序列建模，替代传统分离的融合和GRU模块，提升音频-视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用IRCAM模块整合多模态信息融合和序列建模，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAM-AVN框架通过统一的信息处理和序列建模机制，有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

*Dongsheng Yang,Meiling Zhu,Yinfeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于地标引导知识（LGK）的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来增强常识推理能力，解决传统方法在复杂场景中指令与环境信息匹配不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏常识推理能力，导致指令与环境信息匹配失败。需要引入外部知识来弥补传统方法的不足。

Method: 1.构建包含63万条语言描述的知识库；2.使用知识匹配将环境子视图与知识库对齐；3.设计地标引导知识机制（KGL）聚焦相关知识；4.提出知识引导动态增强（KGDA）整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

*Belona Sonna,Alban Grastien*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用形式溯因解释框架来解释AI决策中的代理歧视，通过背景知识识别作为受保护属性不当代理的特征，揭示隐藏的结构性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当源于结构性偏见时。

Method: 利用背景知识的形式溯因解释框架，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体同等能力个体的公平性。

Result: 以德国信用数据集为例展示了该框架的实际应用，证明其在现实案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解释AI决策中的代理歧视问题，揭示结构性偏见，为AI公平性评估提供实质性方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本定位对象检索增强的VQA方法，通过生成与问题最相关对象的边界框进行针对性图像裁剪，减少背景噪声，提高视觉文本对齐，降低幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声问题，影响视觉与文本的对齐效果，容易产生幻觉。需要更精准的局部信息检索来提升VQA性能。

Method: 引入文本定位的对象定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，同时提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: 相比基线Llama-3.2-Vision-11B代理，准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%，绝对提升3.45个百分点；幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分提高。

Conclusion: 文本定位的对象检索增强方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦检索减少背景干扰，显著降低幻觉现象，为视觉问答任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。该方法通过层次化分区数据库模式、合成多复杂度SQL查询，并应用质量感知管道来确保数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化的问题，现有方法主要关注跨域泛化，而企业需要能够在自己数据库上评估系统性能。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）层次化分区数据库模式为子模式；2）合成多复杂度SQL查询，应用质量感知管道（包括LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡）。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，比最佳3B基线提升+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。1.5B规模的模型也比先前系统提升+9.30 Soft F1和+4.49 EX。

Conclusion: SING-SQL是一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，用于生成和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统，无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限边缘平台上的部署难题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时实现超高压缩比。

Method: 采用协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化三种技术。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的协作压缩框架能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在保持高质量输出的同时实现边缘平台部署，优于传统量化方法。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理（分解和重组概念以解决新问题的能力）方面存在困难。神经符号方法虽有前景，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，限制了灵活性。

Method: NePTune动态地将自然语言查询转换为可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够在VLM生成的不确定性上进行推理的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作，同时其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中使用对抗性测试进行评估，NePTune显示出相对于强基础模型的显著改进，并在新环境中展现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号框架成功解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性，提供了灵活且有效的解决方案，并在多个测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### [152] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）会促使大型推理模型中出现功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制下这些头的演化方式不同：蒸馏和SFT会累积添加稳定的推理头，而GRPO则采用动态搜索模式。研究还揭示了复杂推理与基础计算之间的性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术显著提升了推理能力，但这些改进背后的架构机制仍不明确。本研究旨在揭示后训练如何影响模型内部电路结构，特别是注意力头的功能专门化过程。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化。通过消融实验和定性分析，连接电路级动态与宏观性能表现。

Result: 发现后训练会促使新型功能专门化注意力头的出现；不同训练机制导致不同的头演化模式；可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，而是通过补偿头机制实现；复杂推理能力的增强会以基础计算能力为代价。

Conclusion: 后训练技术通过塑造模型内部电路结构来提升推理能力，但存在复杂推理与基础计算之间的固有张力。未来训练策略设计需要平衡有效推理策略的开发与可靠执行的保证。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创造性任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，缺乏真正的原创性。提供特定线索可部分改善但仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在创造性任务中的表现，研究其是否倾向于使用安全、通用的表达而非原创内容。

Method: 使用广告概念作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告创意，观察特征消失顺序；从简化输入重新生成内容，结合定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 创意特征（隐喻、情感、视觉线索）在简化过程中早期消失，事实内容保留；重新生成的文本虽有词汇多样性但缺乏深度和独特性；提供特定线索可改善对齐和风格平衡。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时，LLMs在创造性任务中趋向平庸；结构化信号可部分抵消此趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索奖励塑造对模型性能的影响，特别是比较不同规模模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，在TravelPlanner基准上进行智能体强化学习实验，重点研究奖励塑造（特别是密集过程级信号）对不同规模模型（8B vs 32B）的影响。

Result: 8B模型对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性能，同时计算效率提高3.5倍，内存效率提高1.5倍。微调模型在域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，较小模型（8B）在效率方面具有竞争优势，且这种效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种防御数据投毒攻击的方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器将投毒图像通过离散瓶颈处理，破坏细粒度触发模式同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，速度慢且不实用。需要一种更高效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN鉴别器，通过学习的码本对投毒图像进行量化，破坏触发模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%投毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。比基于扩散的防御快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [157] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在搜索过程中自适应地决定何时分支，而不是在每一步都分支，显著提高了基于树搜索的LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长程推理任务中虽然性能优异，但计算效率极低，通常比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级。

Method: CiT 使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作来估计一致性）。

Result: BN-DP 在所有设置中一致地将token生成、模型调用和运行时间减少75-85%，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC 通常节省高达80%但存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: CiT 框架能显著提升树搜索方法的效率，辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要，且在确定性动作空间中BN-SC无需LLM即可实现。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HiStyle，一种基于层次化预测和对比学习的语音合成风格嵌入方法，通过两阶段预测和统计-听觉互补的标注策略，显著提升了文本到语音系统的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统从基于标签的控制转向基于自然语言描述的控制，但简单的风格嵌入预测忽略了嵌入的底层分布结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化风格嵌入分布，发现层次聚类模式；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；设计统计方法和人类听觉偏好互补的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在基础TTS模型上相比其他风格嵌入预测方法，实现了显著更好的风格可控性，同时保持了高语音质量和可懂度。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过层次化预测和对比学习有效提升了语音合成的风格控制能力，证明了考虑风格嵌入分布结构的重要性。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制理解的框架，通过识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准激活，并通过预防性微调增强模型的拒绝机制，有效降低特定越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如将请求改为过去时）就能绕过安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法中的泛化差距。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的特定注意力头；2. 训练通道级缩放向量来重新校准易受时态攻击的注意力头的激活；3. 应用"预防性微调"，强制模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 对抗性后缀通过抑制拒绝介导方向的传播来发挥作用，基于机制分析。这项工作展示了如何利用对模型内部的深入理解来开发实用、高效和有针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，用于计算内存(CIM)架构的神经网络加速器设计，通过同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，显著提升了能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化CIM神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数。由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不切实际。

Method: 采用硬件感知的神经架构搜索(HW-NAS)技术，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和广泛的硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基线实现了90.1-104.5倍的EDAP降低，4.68-4.82倍的TOPS/W提升，11.3-12.78倍的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，展示了良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在减少令牌消耗和设计成本的同时达到或超过复杂代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过度依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能受提示调整影响、真实能力被掩盖、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，基于"轻量化"原则，最小化手动设计，保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程和代理基线达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少令牌且设计工作量显著减少。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂性定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Result: 实验显示主流LLM和具身代理容易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险研究和缓解提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，难以高效提取有价值信息。多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系，但现有LLM评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解能力的评估，与实际网络数据挖掘任务脱节。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构并按难度分类，用于系统评估LLM处理复杂JSON的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距，验证了该基准的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准和数据集已开源，旨在推动结构化JSON生成研究，填补了现有评估体系的空白。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical

real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to

TL;DR: 论文研究LLM在推理过程中的中间步骤质量，发现在模型无法有效解决问题时容易出现虚假推理链。通过估计问题可解性，提出改进奖励模型和强化学习的方法，提高推理过程的正确性和答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅需要关注最终答案正确性，还需要确保中间推理步骤的有效性。在多项选择问答场景中，当模型无法有效解决问题时容易产生虚假推理链，导致错误判断。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习方法，将可解性纳入目标函数，使用组相对优势进行优化。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，改进方法能持续提高过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还能提升答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少推理链幻觉和提高CoT推理可靠性的关键因素，通过纳入可解性考量可以显著改善语言模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险评估，包含2900个场景和110万个代理级样本，支持BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。基准测试显示现有VLMs表现不佳，而微调的7B VLM模型将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位代理并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk VQA数据集，包含真实世界数据（nuScenes、Waymo）和模拟器数据（CommonRoad），提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。对知名VLMs进行基准测试，并开发微调的7B VLM模型。

Result: 基准VLMs峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高，而微调模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，展示了专有模型缺乏的显式时空推理能力。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的巨大挑战，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有自动化模型发现方法在平衡细节捕捉与泛化能力方面存在挑战，需要一种能够同时处理局部细节和整体趋势的方法。

Method: 使用两个视觉语言模块：AnalyzerVLM自主规划执行多步骤分析来提议候选模型，EvaluatorVLM从定量和感知角度评估候选模型的局部细节适应性和整体趋势泛化能力。

Result: 该流水线能够有效发现既能捕捉精细细节又能确保强泛化能力的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理对发现优质模型都至关重要。

Conclusion: 多模态多步骤的自动化模型发现流水线通过视觉语言模块的协同工作，成功解决了模型发现中细节捕捉与泛化能力的平衡问题。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoRecomp方法解决RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索效率低的问题，通过策略性重组训练数据引导模型进行简洁推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹效率低下，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声大

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分离为两种批次类型：优先级批次（结合短正确和长错误响应）提供简洁性梯度信号，补偿批次（使用回放缓冲区剩余响应）维持稳定性

Result: 在三种设置下实现显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确性，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在多个设置中实现大幅效率提升且性能影响最小

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器学习遗忘框架，通过检索增强的轻量级校正器来检测和修正模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，无需重新训练即可适应新的遗忘请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在训练过程中记忆敏感信息的问题，现有方法主要抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识，且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应。通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考，实现无需额外训练的适应性。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，包括间接查询场景，同时保持了响应质量和通用实用性。在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架有效解决了机器学习遗忘问题，具有实际应用价值，能够在保持模型性能的同时防止敏感信息泄露。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作的错误信息和AI生成内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型假内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态假内容类型未知，而现有方法通常只针对人工错误信息或AI生成内容中的一种进行专门研究，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 使用基于VLM的主干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器来捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导来定位显著欺骗信号。

Result: 在包含127K样本的OmniFake数据集上，UMFDet在两种欺骗类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS展示了优异的泛化能力，能够有效提升多种NAS方法在不同搜索空间中的性能，为LLM驱动的NAS提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

TL;DR: LLMs在社会科学中作为合成代理使用时，其输出不应被误解为概率推断，而应视为在明确范围条件下的准预测插值模式匹配器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的预测能力、条件提示、token对数概率和重复采样模仿贝叶斯工作流程，其输出容易被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率论，准确的点估计也不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出实用护栏，包括独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以避免类别错误。

Result: 为研究人员提供了有用的原型设计和预测框架，同时避免了将LLMs误用为概率推理替代品的风险。

Conclusion: LLMs应被重新定位为社会科学中的高容量模式匹配器，用于在明确范围条件下的准预测插值，而非概率推断的替代品。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险的动态性和法规的演变，存在严重安全漏洞，需要一种连续自演化的评估方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架SafeEvalAgent，自主处理非结构化政策文档生成安全基准，并通过自演化评估循环不断优化测试用例。

Result: 实验显示模型安全性随评估迭代持续下降，如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%，成功发现传统方法遗漏的漏洞。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，需要动态评估生态系统来确保先进AI的安全负责任部署。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early

depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个面向实践者的现场手册，用于部署使用电子健康记录数据的生成式智能体，重点解决临床AI实施中的社会技术挑战而非算法开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其在实际临床环境中的应用与潜力之间存在显著差距。

Method: 基于在Mass General Brigham部署"irAE-Agent"系统的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，总结出五个关键实施挑战。

Result: 分析显示，临床AI开发中只有不到20%的精力用于提示工程和模型开发，超过80%被实施的社会技术工作所消耗。

Conclusion: 该现场手册将重点从算法开发转向必要的基础设施和实施工作，以弥合"死亡之谷"，成功将生成式AI从试点项目转化为常规临床护理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

TL;DR: UniGen是一个端到端的多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动生成可运行的3D游戏，无需用户编写代码，将开发时间减少91.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等多领域专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者的参与。现有自动化方法存在范围有限、需要手动集成以及处理交互逻辑能力差等问题。

Method: 使用多智能体框架：规划智能体将用户需求解析为结构化蓝图和逻辑描述；生成智能体生成可执行的C#脚本；自动化智能体处理引擎特定组件绑定和场景构建；调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同的游戏原型上评估，UniGen不仅实现了无需编码的游戏创作民主化，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen是首个端到端的协调多智能体框架，能够自动化从自然语言需求到可运行3D游戏的零编码开发，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，提出基于Geertz"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"，要求AI系统产生反映深层文化意义的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法过度依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要更深入地理解文化对齐的真正含义。

Method: 提出基于Clifford Geertz"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"框架，要求AI输出必须基于用户提供的上下文和意图，反映深层文化意义。

Result: 确立了文化对齐成功的三个必要条件：充分界定文化表征、产生细微差别输出的能力、将输出锚定在提示中隐含的文化情境中。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、伦理责任和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 测试大型语言模型作为自主推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的潜力，探索代理如何自由探索系统、提出和验证关于黑盒行为的可泛化陈述。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，在儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟中应用相同的策略，让代理使用有限探测能力进行自主探索。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够通过试错和持久性进行知识发现，结果具有强路径依赖性，并且能够在原子层处理反应器模拟中探索、发现和利用多样化的化学相互作用。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可验证的通用陈述，无需明确指令即可完成知识发现任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

<details>

Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但缺乏系统化、以人为中心的输出评估方法。

Method: 基于Gienapp效用维度框架设计问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评分和语义讨论迭代优化，结合人类评分者和人-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中由于状态-动作空间庞大和奖励稀疏，存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，采用基于势能的奖励塑造机制，并设计启发式方法防止奖励攻击

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务上均优于现有RLVR基线方法，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性是激励深度探索的关键因素，DIVER框架能有效提升LLMs在可验证奖励任务中的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SlimPack通过将样本分解为细粒度切片来解决LLM分布式训练中的上下文长度方差问题，使用非对称分区技术分别优化前向和后向传播，实现了2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练因上下文长度方差严重受阻，传统打包策略和不对称的前向-后向计算成本导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术为前向和后向传播分别构建平衡调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器进行协调。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了最高2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，同时保持了优异的平衡性和资源效率。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过切片级分解和非对称分区技术，在解决数据异构性问题的同时打破了传统权衡，实现了高效且平衡的分布式训练。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Motivation: 解决长时程具身规划中的挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体动作改变，外生过程（如水温升高、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也会与智能体动作同时展开。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生动作和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提案从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型实现了快速规划，能够泛化到包含更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习包含外生过程的抽象世界模型，支持长时程具身规划并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，这与人类通过互动提升推理能力后能独立解决问题的认知方式不符。研究多智能体互动是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互（根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3交互范式进行信息交换）和感知校准（使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中）。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: 多智能体互动确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过动态交互和感知校准有效提升了模型性能，Idea3交互范式增强了推理鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term

Motivation: 现有防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限或工作流程僵化等问题，无法有效检测复杂上下文中嵌入的恶意意图。

Method: 将安全评估分解为三个阶段：意图推断检测输入风险、自我反省评估生成响应并分配置信度判断、自我修订自适应重写不确定输出。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上的实验表明，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种先进防御基线方法。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的保护LLM免受越狱攻击的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据中心化基准测试和多样化模型结构的紧迫性，以推动时间序列基础模型实现真正的通用性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Conclusion: 误进化是一个被忽视的重要安全问题，迫切需要为自进化智能体建立新的安全范式，并讨论了可能的缓解策略。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

*Siyuan Cao,Hongxuan Wu,Jiabao Brad Wang,Yiliang Yuan,Mustafa Misir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上表现优于现有最佳算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因情境而异，没有单一算法始终最优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架来提升预测准确性。

Method: 提出MC-GNNAS-Dock系统：1) 整合结合姿态精度(RMSD)和PoseBusters有效性检查的多标准评估；2) 包含残差连接的架构优化；3) 排名感知损失函数。

Result: 在PDBBind约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBusters验证的复合标准下，相比最佳单算法Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构改进，在分子对接算法选择中展现出持续优越性能，为药物发现提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

TL;DR: 提出了FLoRA-NA方法，通过服务器端估计聚合矩阵来减少联邦低秩适应中的局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 在服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务中，FLoRA-NA实现了最先进的全局性能，同时保持低通信开销。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了先前个性化FedLoRA方法的关键限制，实现了通信效率并弥合了本地个性化与全局泛化之间的差距。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文重新探索了知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新表述为链接预测问题，并开发了一个支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，在多个领域数据集上验证了KGE方法的高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在捕捉上下文语义方面取得了进展，但知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。KGE模型提供可扩展、结构感知的表示，特别适合基于本体的任务，但在实体对齐中应用不足。

Method: 将实体对齐重新表述为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF风格三元组表示。开发了集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型，通过计算实体表示间的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在五个领域的七个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统。虽然召回率中等，但这种保守性使其适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了与LLM方法互补且计算效率高的策略，突出了基于嵌入的实体对齐的前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于Transformer的框架，用于自动分类乳腺动态对比增强MRI中的病灶，通过SegFormer架构实现病变分类，AUC达0.92，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI是癌症检测和治疗规划的重要工具，但其临床效用受到低特异性的限制，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检。现有公共数据集缺乏良性病变标注，限制了良恶性分类研究。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。创建了标准化的深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者和133个标注病灶。训练整合了超过1200名患者的扩展队列。

Result: 病变级别分类AUC为0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检而不遗漏恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病变分类的标准化基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，推动方法学进步向临床部署发展。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL，一种完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，显著降低通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中心服务器等限制，影响了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为实际应用中的大型视觉语言模型去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使它们缺乏自我意识，这种自爱偏见会影响其判断和决策的公正性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否如预期那样免受人类自爱偏见的影响，保持决策中立性。

Method: 通过5项研究、约20,000次查询，包括词语联想任务和API查询对比，直接操纵模型身份来测试自爱与身份认知的因果关系。

Result: LLMs在词语联想中强烈偏好自身名称、公司和CEO，API查询中自偏好消失但模型缺乏自我认知，身份操纵实验显示自爱跟随被赋予而非真实身份。

Conclusion: 自爱偏见深植于LLM认知中，影响重要决策场景，打破了LLMs保持判断中立的承诺，需要模型创造者认真应对。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型(UMMs)的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用生成-理解耦合漏洞，通过时空上下文中的恶意事件隐藏实现无语义漂移的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现统一多模态模型在生成和理解功能耦合时存在安全漏洞，攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，即跨模态生成注入(CMGI)。

Method: 定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，使用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。前两轮利用UMM的生成能力产生场景图像，随后引入基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选中。

Result: STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了UMMs中一个关键但未充分开发的漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

Motivation: 解决机器学习在医学应用中因频率加权训练而忽视罕见但临床关键病例的问题，这种偏见被称为平均患者谬误。

Method: 提出操作改进方法：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例展示了该偏见如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况以及在视力威胁变异上的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们的临床意义重大，权重选择应遵循结构化审议。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效支持犯罪调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据验证信息，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全研究主要关注通用危害，但企业更关心LLM代理在特定用例中的安全性。论文旨在解决LLM是否能适当接受或拒绝与其指定用途相关的查询这一核心问题。

Method: 提出了操作安全性的定义，开发了OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，对6个模型家族的20个开源LLM进行了评估，并提出了查询引导(Q-ground)和系统提示引导(P-ground)两种提示引导方法。

Result: 所有测试的LLM都表现出严重的操作不安全问题，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%的安全表现，而Gemma和Llama-3分别低至39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著改善了性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground使Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全是LLM部署的核心问题，当前所有主流模型都远未达到可靠水平。提示引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的LLM代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为复杂商业软件生态系统构建可靠的计算机使用代理提供现实基准测试，加速企业任务自动化的发展。

Method: 在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标，测试零样本和演示增强两种设置下的多样化代理。

Result: 开源模型代理在SCUBA上成功率低于5%，而闭源模型可达39%；演示增强设置可将成功率提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的前景，不同代理设计范式存在巨大性能差距。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种重新思考AI数据中心全生命周期管理的框架，通过协调建设、硬件更新和运营三个阶段，将总拥有成本降低40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的总拥有成本成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI模型的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期方案，涵盖建设、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并利用运营软件优化降低成本。提出协调三个阶段的整体生命周期管理框架。

Result: 该系统相比传统方法将总拥有成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考整个生命周期管理，协调建设、硬件更新和运营决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化，能够显著降低AI数据中心的TCO。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

*Shaoyi Zheng,Wenbo Lu,Yuxuan Xia,Haomin Liu,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种GPU高效的二维稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像标记实现连续内存布局，在保持空间邻域的同时显著加速扩散变换器的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在保持二维空间局部性和GPU效率之间存在权衡，往往导致非对齐的内存访问。需要一种既能保持空间邻域关系又能实现高效GPU计算的解决方案。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像标记以实现连续内存布局；采用跨层的滑动调度机制实现长距离信息传播；引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知；使用Triton实现。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA实现了显著加速：生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，2048×2048时最高达4.17倍，同时图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功平衡了空间局部性和计算效率。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域。研究发现当前最先进的大语言模型在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上仍远未达到可靠水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂、开放性的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助的推理任务类型。

Method: 创建包含71个复合研究挑战的CritPt基准，覆盖现代物理多个研究领域，这些问题由50多位活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计，并分解为190个更简单的检查点任务。

Result: 当前最先进的LLM在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究挑战上表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅为4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现细微的人口统计特征变化会破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是导致偏差的主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全性和公平性问题，包括数据投毒、提示注入和公平性缺陷。RAG系统虽然能减少幻觉，但其检索组件可能引入或放大偏见，需要系统性评估。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计特征扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，轻微的人口统计特征变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，偏差存在一致的层次结构，种族线索是导致违规的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG系统中的检索组件需要仔细筛选以防止偏见放大，研究结果为开发者和测试人员提供了实用警示，提醒在采用可访问的小型语言模型时不能牺牲公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BRIDGE框架，通过离线专家演示和在线人类偏好反馈的两阶段方法，解决强化学习在机器人等领域的安全性和样本效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗等领域的应用面临两个主要障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据饥渴的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的人类反馈进行在线微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习获得更低的遗憾值。离线数据数量与在线样本效率呈正相关。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

*Yuyang Liu,Chuan Wen,Yihang Hu,Dinesh Jayaraman,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励信号的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人强化学习需要大量手动设计密集奖励，这既费时又难以扩展。将任务进度视为密集奖励信号是一个有前景的解决方案。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个挑战性Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互，超越了先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder展示了从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的可扩展潜力，特别是能够利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Conclusion: 为复杂构念的测量提供了一个透明的方法，为更广泛和可解释的AI评估奠定了原则性基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于目标蛋白生成新分子的方法通常依赖3D构象空间，这些方法往往缓慢且过于复杂，需要更简单高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用基于1D SELFIES字符串的潜在扩散模型，训练了创新的SELFIES变换器，并提出了一种新的多任务机器学习模型损失平衡方法。

Result: 模型能够以简单高效的方式为目标蛋白生成高亲和力分子。

Conclusion: SOLD模型提供了一种有效的分子生成方法，并为通过添加更多数据进行未来改进留下了空间。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图求解方法主要依赖视觉线索，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中缺乏语义指导。本文探索利用自然语言描述为拼图组装提供语义引导。

Method: 提出视觉-语言层次语义对齐(VLHSA)模块，通过从局部标记到全局上下文的多层次语义匹配，将视觉补丁与文本描述对齐。采用结合双视觉编码器和语言特征的多模态架构进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，实现了14.2个百分点的拼图块精度提升。消融研究证实VLHSA模块对改进视觉仅方法的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过融入多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式，证明了语言上下文在提升拼图组装性能中的重要性。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)，一种轻量级的推理时优化方法，通过使用最近logits的谱和熵特性动态调整token分布，无需更新模型参数即可提高LLM的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销高、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: SLS维护一个top-K logits的滑动缓冲区，执行实时奇异值分解(SVD)识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit gap统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在不确定性高时激活。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: SLS是一种有效的推理时优化方法，能够在保持上下文一致性的同时锐化输出分布，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图自监督学习方法（如GRACE）由于依赖非多项式操作，无法与同态加密等隐私保护技术兼容，这限制了在隐私敏感场景下的应用。

Method: 设计了完全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，确保所有操作都适合同态加密计算。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在CiteSeer数据集上性能甚至优于标准的非隐私基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步，解决了现有方法与隐私保护技术不兼容的关键问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，在双曲流形上开发优化方法，特别适用于Poincaré球上的学习，并可能为欧几里得和其他非欧几里得设置带来益处，因为选择的优化鼓励学习Poincaré嵌入。

Method: 扩展双曲随机梯度下降（Riemannian SGD的特化）到双曲Adam优化器，在扩散模型中使用双曲优化方法结合Langevin动力学的双曲时间离散化进行训练。

Result: 在特定数据集上实现了更快的收敛速度，特别是在训练早期阶段当参数远离最优值时，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法能够加速收敛，特别是在训练初期，为双曲流形上的优化提供了有效的工具，并在扩散模型中展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in

persist, especially due to variability in generated outputs. We introduce a
multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs
in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main
factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work

TL;DR: DPSformer是一个针对暴雨预报的长尾学习模型，通过高分辨率分支增强对罕见暴雨事件的表示，显著提升了暴雨预报的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水分布高度不平衡，大多数观测记录无雨或小雨，而暴雨事件罕见。这种不平衡分布阻碍深度学习模型有效预测暴雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预报明确视为长尾学习问题，引入DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富暴雨事件的表示。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的暴雨事件，DPSformer将基准数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的暴雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为暴雨预测建立了一个有效的长尾范式，为增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning

*Hao Chen,Tao Han,Jie Zhang,Song Guo,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了STCast框架，通过空间对齐注意力机制自适应优化区域边界，并使用时间混合专家模块动态分配月度预测，在多个天气预测任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域天气预测方法受限于静态不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差。需要解决边界优化和动态时间分配问题。

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制初始化并自适应优化区域边界，设计时间混合专家模块通过离散高斯分布将不同月份大气变量动态路由到专业专家。

Result: 实验结果表明，在全局和区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测四个任务中，STCast均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态时间分配，显著提升了天气预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

*Remi Genet,Hugo Inzirillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEMs是一种新型深度学习框架，将transformer架构扩展到处理具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，通过解耦市场信息处理和分配决策实现统一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展神经VWAP执行策略，从固定时长订单推广到执行时长在最小和最大时间范围内有界的场景，类似于股票回购合约结构。

Method: 使用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制构建通用特征提取管道处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理不同场景的特定执行逻辑，实现架构分离。

Result: 在加密货币日内市场和多日股票交易中，LEMs相比传统基准实现了更优的执行性能，能在灵活时间约束内动态优化执行路径。

Conclusion: 统一模型架构可通过单一框架部署到不同执行场景，相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究将田口实验设计方法应用于CNN超参数优化，通过正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，开发了5种多目标优化方法，发现学习率是最关键参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或网格搜索，计算成本高昂，需要更系统高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术。

Result: 方法3获得最佳性能：训练准确率98.84%，验证准确率86.25%，损失值最小。学习率是最关键参数。

Conclusion: 田口方法能有效优化CNN超参数，学习率、图像尺寸和激活函数是最重要的参数，为超参数优化提供了系统指导。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA是一种动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置的方法，无需重复微调，通过配置感知模型实现，并使用帕累托优化配置搜索来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型预训练模型的发布，在边缘设备上部署这些模型需要有效的压缩方法。现有方法需要为每个量化配置单独微调LoRA适配器，这在计算上是不可行的。

Method: 提出CoA-LoRA方法，通过配置感知模型将每个量化配置映射到其低秩调整，并使用帕累托优化配置搜索来构建高质量的训练配置集。

Result: 实验表明，CoA-LoRA在无需额外时间成本的情况下，性能可与需要为每个配置单独微调的最先进方法相媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA提供了一种高效的方法来动态适应不同的量化配置，解决了边缘设备部署中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Motivation: 解决多元时间序列异常检测问题，通过分区方法保持变量间关系，提高检测性能。

Method: 基于变量间多重相关系数的聚类来识别变量子集，然后在每个子集上局部执行异常检测算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法在多元时间序列异常检测中表现出显著优势，验证了分区方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: 该论文通过生物分类任务重新审视双下降现象，发现只有当模型复杂度在多个维度上同时扩展时才会出现双下降，而固定任一维度时泛化行为会回归经典U型或L型模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双下降现象在简单模型中的存在性，通过生物分类任务验证双下降是否普遍存在，并探索模型复杂度多维度特性对泛化行为的影响。

Method: 使用结核病异烟肼耐药性预测任务，系统性地在两个正交维度上变化模型复杂度：学习器容量和集成规模，并在合成基准上复现结果。

Result: 双下降现象仅当复杂度在多个维度上联合扩展时才一致出现，固定任一维度时泛化行为回归经典模式，支持展开假说。

Conclusion: 模型复杂度应被视为多维构造，在分析泛化行为时需要考虑多个维度的相互作用。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Motivation: 解决概率图模型中最可能解释推理这一本质上难解问题的计算效率问题。

Method: 训练神经网络对变量赋值进行评分，基于现有MPE求解器搜索轨迹生成训练数据，将学习到的启发式与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在具有高树宽度的PGM上，学习到的启发式显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或改进解的质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架为加速MPE推理提供了一种可扩展的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: TinyML技术发展需要解决推理时间与分类质量之间的平衡问题，特别是在计算、内存和能源受限的嵌入式系统中。

Method: 采用动态集成选择聚类方法，实现TinyDES-Clustering库，针对嵌入式系统限制进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池能提高分类精度，但会增加TinyML设备的平均推理时间。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择方法在TinyML系统中具有应用潜力，但需要在精度和效率之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂城市环境中的流场估计提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案，有望应用于完整城市估计和天气输入集成。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

TL;DR: 提出了残差线性注意力（RLA）框架，通过显式残差拟合机制解决线性注意力在捕获长程模式时的表达瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供了线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但在捕获长程模式方面往往表现不佳。现有变体可以被视为历史预测和单标记校正的组合，这造成了表达瓶颈。

Method: 引入RLA框架，通过维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并校正基础预测。具体实例化了残差Delta网络（RDN），包含自适应门控和残差裁剪以增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性缩放。

Conclusion: RLA框架通过显式残差拟合机制有效解决了线性注意力的表达瓶颈问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

Motivation: Multi-head Latent Attention虽然减少了KVCache内存使用，但带来了显著的计算开销和中间变量扩展，这对硬件实现提出了挑战，特别是在解码阶段。

Method: AMLA基于两项核心创新：(1) 新颖的FlashAttention算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；(2) 预加载流水线策略与分层分块，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上，AMLA达到614 TFLOPS，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现（在NVIDIA H800上最高66.7%利用率）。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，即将发布，为昇腾NPU上的MLA计算提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Conclusion: MSCoD通过多尺度特征提取和不对称注意力机制，有效解决了结构药物设计中的层次相互作用捕捉问题，展现了良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Conclusion: 该研究提出的贝叶斯优化MVMD-LSTM框架有效解决了集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期预测问题，为海上清洁电力供应提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Motivation: 为注入式归一化流提供理论严谨且实用的框架，连接随机投影理论与归一化流，克服PCA流和学习注入映射的局限性。

Method: 使用通过高斯矩阵QR分解从Haar分布正交系综中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，将数据投影到低维潜在空间用于基分布，并提供黎曼体积修正项的闭式表达式。

Conclusion: RPFs是即插即用、高效的注入式归一化流框架，成功连接了随机投影理论与归一化流领域。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Motivation: 时间数据的一个有用归纳偏置是轨迹应保持在数据流形附近。传统流匹配方法依赖直线条件路径，而学习测地线的方法使用RBF核或最近邻图，这些方法在高维空间中面临维度灾难问题。

Method: 使用分数匹配和退火能量蒸馏来学习一个能够忠实捕捉底层数据几何结构的度量张量，从而指导更准确的流生成。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地捕捉数据几何结构，为流匹配提供了更可靠的几何指导。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF

TL;DR: WDformer是一个基于小波变换的差分Transformer模型，通过多分辨率分析和差分注意力机制，在时间序列预测任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法在时域或频域单独建模时无法充分利用多域信息，且传统注意力机制容易过度关注无关历史信息，引入噪声导致预测偏差。

Method: 使用小波变换对时间序列进行多分辨率分析，结合时频域联合表示提取关键信息；在倒置维度上应用注意力机制捕获多变量关系；引入差分注意力机制，通过两个独立softmax注意力矩阵的差异计算注意力分数。

Result: WDformer在多个具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上取得了最先进的结果，证明了其准确性和有效性。

Conclusion: WDformer通过小波变换和差分注意力机制，有效解决了时间序列预测中多域信息利用不足和注意力噪声问题，在多个实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了高斯混合近似(GMA)采样器家族，用于采样未归一化的目标密度。该方法采用两阶段范式：初始化高斯组件并采样，然后通过优化权重或均值和方差来拟合目标分布，最后进行分层重采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需梯度、计算高效且仅需未归一化密度评估的采样方法，能够处理复杂的目标分布。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 初始化高斯组件并采样；2) 通过KL散度目标优化组件权重或均值和方差，使用投影梯度下降、镜像下降或EM算法，最后进行分层重采样。

Result: 在温和条件下产生一致的近似，经验结果验证了该方法在多样密度上的准确性和速度。

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种梯度自由、计算高效的采样框架，能够产生忠实于目标分布的样本，适用于各种复杂密度。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

TL;DR: 提出了FedCLF方法，通过校准损失和反馈控制机制解决联邦学习在车联网中的高数据异构性挑战，显著提升模型精度和资源利用效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网等动态异构环境中面临数据异构性和设备异构性的挑战，需要提高模型准确性和资源利用效率

Method: 引入校准损失作为参与者选择的效用指标，并采用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率

Result: 在高数据异构性场景下，FedCLF相比基线模型（FedAvg、Newt、Oort）性能提升高达16%，同时通过减少采样频率提高了效率

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效应对高度异构数据环境，在车联网等资源受限网络中实现更高效的联邦学习

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个训练语言代理具备故障恢复能力的框架，通过系统性的故障注入和专家演示构建训练数据，使代理能够在真实工具环境中检测错误并执行恢复操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言代理训练只优化成功轨迹，无法应对真实世界中普遍存在的工具故障（如超时、API异常、输出不一致等），导致级联推理错误和任务放弃。

Method: 通过系统性故障注入和专家演示构建50,000+恢复标注轨迹，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力的同时注入恢复能力，在推理时检测错误并从55+故障示例库中检索相似案例执行恢复操作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%，对未见工具API保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Motivation: 传统基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 提出HAMMER框架，将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标转移到动态强化学习过程中，通过最小语义汉密尔顿路径对训练样本进行排序。

Conclusion: 从泛化界限的理论视角看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法有效解决了课程强化学习中的探索问题。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要专业知识的专门领域（如网络安全）的零样本表现往往不理想，因为基础模型是为通用应用设计的，难以在参数空间中封装领域专业知识。

Method: 研究了三种微调方法：监督微调(SFT)、低秩适应(LoRA)和量化低秩适应(QLoRA)，使用网络安全问答数据集进行实验。

Result: 所有微调方法在网络安全问答任务中都显著优于基础模型。LoRA和QLoRA在性能上与SFT相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略能够有效弥合通用大语言模型与领域特定应用之间的差距，为适应专门领域提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法（如投影均方损失或CKA）无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零时也存在局限性。

Method: 采用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些距离在表示对齐度量中已很常见。

Result: 在BERT和OPT语言模型家族的分类和指令跟随任务中，蒸馏性能提升了最多2个百分点，显示出统计显著性改进。

Conclusion: 将特征几何整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，新方法能更好地保持教师模型的特征空间结构。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了系统化自适应框架，推进了轻量级优化技术的设计，支持可扩展和可持续的语言模型应用。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global

study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功捕捉了多模态间的丰富协同信息，显著提升了多模态表示学习性能。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Method: 通过符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，使用稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并通过稀疏专家混合机制实现黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个数据集上相比10个基线方法，完整观察下相对改进4-8%，部分观察下平均改进9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中展现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的异构无线网络资源分配框架，在动态网络中联合优化传输功率、带宽和调度，性能优于传统启发式算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在异构无线网络中难以应对变化的用户负载和信道条件，需要更智能的资源分配方案

Method: 使用深度强化学习框架，采用PPO和TD3算法，通过多目标奖励函数平衡吞吐量、能效和公平性

Result: 在多种网络场景下，DRL框架相比三种启发式算法在资源分配优化方面表现更优

Conclusion: DRL方法在动态异构网络中具有优势，研究揭示了未来HetNets中DRL设计的关键权衡

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

TL;DR: ClustRecNet是一个基于深度学习的推荐框架，用于为给定数据集选择最合适的聚类算法，解决了无监督学习中聚类算法选择的长期挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督学习中聚类算法选择的挑战，减少对手工元特征和传统聚类有效性指标的依赖。

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据仓库，使用10种流行聚类算法处理，通过调整兰德指数评估聚类结果建立真实标签。网络架构整合卷积、残差和注意力机制，捕捉输入数据的局部和全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，该深度学习模型始终优于传统聚类有效性指标（如轮廓系数、Calinski-Harabasz、Davies-Bouldin和Dunn指数）以及最先进的AutoML聚类推荐方法（如ML2DAC、AutoCluster和AutoML4Clust）。在合成数据上比Calinski-Harabasz指数提高0.497 ARI，在真实数据上比最佳AutoML方法提高15.3% ARI。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习有效解决了聚类算法选择问题，显著优于传统方法和现有AutoML方法，为无监督学习中的算法选择提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM在RL后训练中的缩放规律，发现更大模型在固定计算预算下表现更好，具有更优的样本效率，数据重复使用有效，且这些规律在不同模型类型中具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练阶段LLM的缩放规律已被广泛研究，但RL后训练阶段的缩放行为仍未被充分探索，特别是在数学推理任务上。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统分析模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，重点关注数学推理任务。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：1) 固定计算预算下大模型训练更少步数表现更好；2) 固定数据量下大模型样本效率更高；3) 数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；4) 这些规律在不同模型类型中具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了LEO-CVAE方法，通过局部熵引导的过采样解决类别不平衡问题，特别关注边界区域的不确定性样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，在非线性生物医学数据中产生不合理的合成样本；而标准CVAE对所有少数类样本同等对待，忽略了边界区域不确定样本的重要性

Method: 使用局部熵量化不确定性，通过局部熵加权损失(LEWL)和熵引导采样策略，在表示学习和数据生成中明确纳入局部不确定性

Result: 在临床基因组数据集(ADNI和TCGA肺癌)上，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样和生成基线方法

Conclusion: 在复杂非线性结构主导的领域(如组学数据)中，不确定性感知的生成过采样对不平衡学习具有重要价值

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索梯度下降在矩阵分解问题中的动力学行为，特别是大步长情况下参数空间的复杂结构特征。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界步长，并扩展到一般矩阵分解的正交初始化情况。

Result: 发现临界步长附近存在分形边界，初始条件的微小变化会导致收敛到不同极小值或发散，正则化会放大这种敏感性。

Conclusion: 临界步长附近的梯度下降进入混沌状态，长期动态不可预测，且不存在简单的隐式偏好（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active

Conclusion: 该方法成功将物理原理融入蛋白质生成过程，提升了生成结构的真实性和设计性，为蛋白质设计领域带来重要进展。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了训练重评估曲线(TREC)，用于分析训练数据在不同训练阶段的保留效果，并发现将高质量数据放置在TREC低谷能显著提升模型性能。TREC可以通过AdamW的隐式EMA系数提前预测，从而实现主动的课程设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据课程对LLM训练至关重要，但最优数据放置原则尚不明确。需要一种诊断工具来理解训练数据在不同训练阶段的保留效果，以指导更好的数据课程设计。

Method: 引入训练重评估曲线(TREC)，使用最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次。分析从111M到3.9B参数模型的TREC，并利用AdamW的隐式EMA系数预测TREC。

Result: 将高质量数据放置在TREC低谷能显著改善性能。TREC可以提前预测，解释了先前消融实验并揭示了次优数据放置。在3.9B参数LLM的持续预训练中，将高质量数据与TREC最小值对齐取得了改进。

Conclusion: TREC为理解训练动态提供了新视角，能够指导更优的数据课程设计，通过预测性方法改善LLM训练效率。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Motivation: 在重症监护等临床环境中，需要处理包含动态风险因素和静态预测因子的复杂数据，同时面临数据不规则和不完整的挑战。传统模型难以有效整合功能协变量和处理缺失数据。

Method: 结合用于功能数据表示的微网络基础层和基于梯度的插补模块，FCRN同时学习插补缺失值和预测事件特定风险。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集和真实世界ICU案例研究（使用MIMIC-IV和Cleveland Clinic数据集）上的评估显示，FCRN在预测准确性上显著优于随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛从干净输入中抽取后验样本，与编码器从噪声数据输出的结果进行统计比较。

Result: 模型能准确重建信号，但潜在空间存在明显不匹配，去噪性能强不代表潜在表示可靠。

Conclusion: 在评估生成模型时，使用基于后验的验证方法至关重要，仅凭重建精度不足以评估模型质量。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断能够缓解方程发现中的过拟合问题并促进模型泛化，特别适用于结构健康监测中变化载荷条件的场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但计算需求大限制了部署。现有稀疏加速方法需要定制内核，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中达到2.5-3.8倍加速，最高达到理论极限的87.5%。应用多粒度稀疏策略使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用高效的稀疏加速解决方案，显著提升DiT模型推理效率，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这种相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和迁移中起着更关键的作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（不对称多LoRA设计，使用多个A矩阵和单个共享B矩阵进行多任务微调）和Fed-ALoRA（在联邦微调中跨客户端共享B矩阵，通过新颖的矩阵分解策略适应客户端的异构秩）。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有的多LoRA方法，我们的方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了跨任务更平衡的性能。

Conclusion: 通过共享B矩阵的不对称LoRA设计能够有效提升多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性，验证了B矩阵在知识编码中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对时序图神经网络的新型对抗攻击框架HIA，通过识别结构重要性和动态重要性节点，结合边注入和删除策略，在最小扰动下显著降低TGNN性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序图对抗攻击方法依赖简单扰动且容易被检测，无法有效针对最具影响力的节点和边进行攻击，无法充分暴露TGNN的脆弱性。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略（边注入和边删除），最小化扰动数量以提高隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4种TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低了链接预测任务的准确性，MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了当前STDG模型的基本脆弱性，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

### [263] [Polychromic Objectives for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25424)
*Jubayer Ibn Hamid,Ifdita Hasan Orney,Ellen Xu,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为polychromic objective的新目标函数，用于解决强化学习微调中策略多样性丧失的问题，通过改进PPO算法来保持和利用多样化的生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLFT方法在微调预训练策略时，容易导致策略多样性丧失，收敛到少数易被利用的输出，这阻碍了探索和测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 使用vine采样收集策略轨迹，修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势，将PPO算法适配到polychromic目标优化。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法提高了成功率，能解决更多环境配置，在大扰动下泛化更好，在pass@k实验中实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic目标能有效保持策略多样性，提升探索能力和泛化性能，使策略能够维持和利用多样化的策略库。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预算控制方法依赖临时参数调整，存在不稳定和低效的问题，需要更原则性的控制方法。

Method: 结合分桶滞后控制和比例反馈机制，提供参数选择框架和分析，实现期望支出率的准确跟踪。

Result: 在真实拍卖环境中，相比基线方法，支出误差减少13%，λ波动性降低54%，显著提升了控制精度和投放一致性。

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，该方法为预算控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别有利于小预算广告活动。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

### [265] [Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438)
*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控(LPM)的新方法，通过监控模型改进而非预测误差来指导探索，有效避免智能体被不可学习的随机噪声源(如noisy-TV)困住。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对不可学习的随机噪声源时会被困住，而基于不确定性估计的方法虽然最终能逃脱但样本效率低、计算成本高。受人类在探索过程中监控自身进步的启发，提出了LPM方法。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在前一次迭代中的预期预测误差，通过当前迭代与先前迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM方法概念简单但有效，标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性，有效引导智能体观察可学习的转换。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

### [266] [Norm-Q: Effective Compression Method for Hidden Markov Models in Neuro-Symbolic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25439)
*Hanyuan Gao,Xiaoxuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Norm-Q方法，一种用于压缩概率符号模型（如隐马尔可夫模型）的归一化线性量化方法，通过减少数据位宽来缓解内存和带宽压力，实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐马尔可夫模型在神经符号应用中具有强大能力，但继承了神经网络和符号推理的缺点，需要密集计算和数据传输，性能受限。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，减少数据位宽，最小化对模型性能的影响。

Result: 在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达到99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法相比传统量化方法实现了更高的压缩率和合理的分数损失，为概率符号模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

TL;DR: 提出了时间序列联合嵌入预测架构(TS-JEPA)，通过潜在空间的自监督学习来改进时间序列表示学习，在分类和预测任务上达到或超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法依赖自回归和掩码建模，容易受到噪声和混淆变量的影响。JEPA架构通过在潜在空间进行自监督学习来解决这个问题，但需要针对时间序列领域进行专门适配。

Method: 开发了专门针对时间序列的TS-JEPA架构，基于联合嵌入预测架构(JEPA)原理，在潜在空间进行自监督学习。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的分类和预测任务中，TS-JEPA能够匹配或超越当前最先进的基线方法，并在不同任务间表现出良好的性能平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入的未来时间序列基础模型开发奠定了基础，展示了TS-JEPA作为学习通用表示的强大潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效的多任务DAgger框架，通过性能感知调度策略从多个任务特定专家策略中蒸馏出单一多任务策略，显著提高了任务成功率并减少了专家演示需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人策略通常需要大量专家数据或仿真训练，本研究旨在开发数据高效的方法来学习多任务策略。

Method: 使用基于卡尔曼滤波的估计器跟踪每个任务从数据中获益的程度，通过性能感知调度策略主动关注多任务策略表现不佳的任务，跨任务分配额外演示。

Result: 在MetaWorld和IsaacLab抽屉开启任务套件上验证，所得策略在所有任务上都达到高性能，使用显著更少的专家演示，仿真学习的视觉策略在零样本迁移到真实机器人时表现优于朴素DAgger和行为克隆。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效学习多任务策略，减少对专家数据的依赖，并在仿真到真实迁移中表现出色。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

*Danyang Li,Yixuan Wang,Matthew Cleaveland,Mingyu Cai,Roberto Tron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的可微分符合预测框架，用于信号时序逻辑推理，提供统计正确性保证并提高结果公式的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信号时序逻辑推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统的符合预测技术通常作为训练后包装器使用，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非一致性评分，将平滑的符合预测层直接嵌入训练过程，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和符合预测集。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测不确定性（实现高覆盖率同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数量减少）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为学习到的STL公式提供统计保证，在可靠性和准确性方面优于现有最先进基线方法。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P2Es是一个基于扩散模型的创新框架，能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联心电图，通过频率域模糊、时间噪声干扰和人口统计学感知的反向过程实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统依赖笨重的多电极设置，限制了动态监测；而当前基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es人口统计学感知扩散框架：前向过程使用频率域模糊和时间噪声干扰模拟真实信号失真；反向过程包含时间多尺度生成模块和频率去模糊；利用KNN聚类和对比学习分配亲和矩阵，实现人口统计学特定的ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es框架成功地从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联ECG，为动态心血管监测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于磁盘的ANNS方法存在I/O遍历路径长、与存储I/O粒度不匹配、内存索引开销高等问题，限制了大规模向量搜索的可扩展性。

Method: 提出页面节点图结构，将逻辑图节点与物理SSD页面对齐；相似向量聚类到页面节点；设计协同磁盘数据布局和合并技术；采用轻量级索引和内存-磁盘协同数据分配策略。

Result: 在多个数据集和内存预算下，PageANN比最先进的磁盘ANNS方法吞吐量提高1.85-10.83倍，延迟降低51.7%-91.9%，同时保持高召回率。

Conclusion: PageANN通过页面节点图结构和优化的内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈，为大规模向量搜索提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上的不可靠性限制了其在药物发现等高风险领域的应用，特别是化学幻觉问题导致模型对未知分子做出高置信度但完全错误的预测。

Method: 提出了分子偏好对齐实例排序方法，将OOD检测问题表述为对ID和OOD样本之间估计OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标。

Result: 在五个真实世界分子数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在尺寸、支架和测定分布偏移下AUROC分别提升了45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单、即插即用的模块，可以灵活集成到现有基础模型中，通过经济高效的后训练提高其在OOD数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Conclusion: EEsizer证明了基于LLM的AI代理能够有效自动化晶体管尺寸优化过程，为模拟电路设计提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Method: 使用TD-MPC2模型基强化学习算法，在10个真实患者血管解剖中训练单一RL智能体进行多任务血管内导航

Result: TD-MPC2在多任务学习中显著优于SAC，成功率65% vs 37%，路径比改善，但手术时间增加

Conclusion: 世界模型有潜力改善自主血管内导航，为通用AI驱动机器人介入奠定基础

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

*Yichi Zhang,Fangzheng Xie,Shu Yang,Chong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果推断的LLM路由器训练框架，通过结合黄金标准和偏好数据来纠正偏好数据偏差，提高路由准确性和成本-质量平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。LLM路由器可以从候选池中选择最适合每个查询的模型，但训练高质量路由器的核心挑战是可靠监督数据的稀缺。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推断框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配。基于这一新视角，开发了一个综合因果路由器训练框架，纠正偏好数据偏差，处理两个数据源之间的不平衡，并提高路由的鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能够提供更准确的路由，并改善成本与质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过因果推断框架有效解决了LLM路由器训练中偏好数据偏差问题，实现了更优的路由性能和成本效益平衡。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成建模和主动学习的队列优先级算法，用于解决科学中的逆向设计问题，显著提高了高质量候选分子的发现数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在解决科学逆向设计问题时既带来机遇也带来风险，能够自主扩展和优化搜索空间，但会探索低质量区域直到充分微调。

Method: 提出队列优先级算法，将生成建模与主动学习结合在分布式工作流中，使用主动学习模型优先选择顶级设计候选，防止资源浪费在无意义候选上。

Result: 在碳捕获分子结构发现任务中，主动学习方法显著增加了生成模型识别的高质量候选数量：无主动学习平均生成281个高性能候选，有主动学习平均生成604个高性能候选。

Conclusion: 结合主动学习的优先级算法能有效防止生成模型衰减，显著提高生成式AI工作流在复杂设计空间探索中的效率和质量。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临非独立同分布数据和对抗性客户端行为的鲁棒性挑战，现有基于Shapley值的方法计算开销过大，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用轨迹影响估计计算客户端贡献，通过客户端更新和公共验证集上的轻量级梯度操作，引入归一化和平滑处理的影响分数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST上的实验表明，FedIF在标签噪声、梯度噪声和对抗样本下达到或超过SV方法的鲁棒性，同时将聚合开销降低高达450倍。

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论上有依据且可扩展的替代方案，用于高效和鲁棒的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个在上下文强化学习中确保安全性的方法，通过约束马尔可夫决策过程框架，在无需参数更新的适应过程中同时最大化奖励和最小化成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文强化学习(ICRL)方法在适应新任务时缺乏安全性保障，需要开发能够在无参数更新情况下同时优化奖励和控制成本的算法。

Method: 在ICRL框架中引入约束马尔可夫决策过程，通过扩展策略神经网络的输入上下文来同时处理奖励最大化和成本最小化目标，并根据成本容忍度阈值动态调整行为策略。

Result: 代理能够根据成本预算主动调整行为策略：预算较高时行为更激进，预算较低时行为更保守，实现了安全的自适应强化学习。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将安全性约束集成到上下文强化学习中，为ICRL在现实世界高风险场景的应用提供了安全保障。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的无导数优化方法在高维、噪声或混合整数设置中表现不佳，需要利用机器学习和强化学习的进展来提升黑盒优化的性能。

Method: 使用机器学习提供表达性代理模型、自适应更新、元学习组合和生成模型；利用强化学习实现动态算子配置、鲁棒性和跨任务元优化。

Result: 开发了多种先进算法，包括mlrMBO、ZO-AdaMM、ABBO、DiBB、SPBOpt、B2Opt、扩散模型黑盒优化、Surr-RLDE、RBO、CAS-MORE、LB-SGD、PIBB和Q-Mamba等。

Conclusion: 机器学习和强化学习将经典的不精确求解器转变为更可扩展、鲁棒和自适应的现实世界优化框架。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，通过将激活值限制为0或1来提高特征的解释性和单义性，但会增加重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏自编码器(SAE)中许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释的问题，消除通过连续特征激活变化传递不可解释信息的问题。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，将所有激活值约束为二进制(0或1)，消除连续激活强度的变化。

Result: 二进制化显著提高了发现特征的解释性和单义性，但增加了重构误差，同时产生了更多不可解释的超高频特征。频率调整后，连续稀疏编码器的解释性得分略优于二进制方法。

Conclusion: 多义性可能是神经激活的不可消除特性，二进制化虽然改善了某些方面的解释性，但也带来了新的挑战。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的模型剪枝方法EMP，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定剪枝阈值，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型剪枝中的核心问题：确定保留多少参数，提供一种与上下文无关、无需参数的通用剪枝规则。

Method: 基于逆辛普森指数计算有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，适用于权重大小、注意力分数、KAN重要性分数等多种剪枝标准。

Result: 在MLP、CNN、Transformer/LLM和KAN等模型上，剪枝后的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一种鲁棒的剪枝阈值，默认β=1表现良好，β≠1可作为可选调整以满足特定稀疏性需求。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

Motivation: 确保电网弹性需要及时无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖人工标注数据且难以捕捉复杂时空依赖关系。

Method: 结合窗口注意力Transformer和双向生成对抗网络，使用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕捉复杂时空依赖，联合判别器强制执行循环一致性来对齐潜在空间与真实数据分布。

Result: 在硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN实现了0.95的ROC-AUC和0.996的平均精度，显著优于领先的监督和无监督方法，特别擅长检测微妙的频率和电压偏差。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN展示了在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下进行实时广域监测的实用价值，为电网异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

TL;DR: 提出D-Rank框架，通过层间动态秩分配优化LLM的SVD压缩，考虑不同层的信息密度差异，相比均匀压缩方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩率，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异，中间层通常包含更丰富信息而首尾层更冗余。

Method: 引入有效秩作为信息密度度量，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，对信息密度高的层组分配更多容量，并针对注意力层重新平衡秩分配。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩率下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing，在LLaMA-3-8B上达到15%更低的困惑度，在LLaMA-7B上实现5%更高的零样本推理准确率。

Conclusion: D-Rank证明了考虑层间异质性的动态秩分配策略在LLM压缩中的有效性，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更高的压缩效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其典型的慢速迭代求解器在S2S应用中不实用，因为需要长提前期和领域驱动的校准。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现基于连续排名概率得分（CRPS）目标的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动。

Result: Swift产生熟练的6小时预报，可稳定运行达75天，比最先进扩散基线快39倍，预报技能与基于数值的IFS ENS相当。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预条件处理如何通过Gram矩阵影响特征学习和泛化性能，发现预条件器引入的光谱偏置对特征学习有可控影响，当这种偏置与教师模型对齐时能显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索，需要研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，在单索引教师模型框架下，分析指数p和教师与输入谱对齐对泛化的影响，并从噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移三个角度研究特征学习。

Result: 学习到的特征表示紧密反映了预条件器引入的光谱偏置——偏好被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件敏感性降低。当这种光谱偏置与教师模型对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过Gram矩阵控制特征学习的光谱偏置，泛化性能的关键在于预条件器的光谱偏置与教师模型的对齐程度，这为理解预条件处理在泛化中的作用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONets虽然广泛用于科学机器学习中的算子学习，但需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了实际应用。现有扩展如VIDON放松了传感器约束，但仍无法处理不完全测量或算子固有随机性带来的不确定性。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入来处理稀疏和可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器（cVAE）来近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO提供原则性不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了所提框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测准确性的同时，提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了算子学习中的传感器约束和不确定性量化问题。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Method: 提出BaB-prob方法，通过分裂预激活将原问题迭代划分为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算每个子问题的概率边界，引入不确定性水平概念并设计两种高效的预激活分裂策略。

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试上的评估表明，该方法在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: BaB-prob方法成功将分支定界框架扩展到概率验证，证明了其在feedforward-ReLU神经网络上的完备性和可靠性，并在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to

*Qihang Yao,Constantine Dovrolis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种基于增长的稀疏训练方法，通过路径权重乘积引导的随机增长来自动发现网络的最佳密度，相比传统剪枝方法显著降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先固定目标密度。需要一种能够自动发现网络最佳密度的更高效方法。

Method: PWMPR从稀疏种子开始，基于路径核启发式评分添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，并使用逻辑拟合规则检测精度平台期来自动停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR能够接近IMP彩票的性能（虽然密度更高），但训练成本显著降低（约1.5倍稠密训练 vs IMP的3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的新范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和可解释性改进

Conclusion: 时序多模态交互揭示了跨应用的有意义模式，可用于改进MoE模型的设计和性能

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在训练过程中学习了大量决策规则，但在高维输入空间中这些规则难以识别和解释。需要找到既保持模型决策又简洁可读的最小解释。

Method: 训练轻量级自编码器生成二值掩码，训练目标整合多层激活对齐、输出标签一致性、稀疏性和紧凑性先验，以及确保忠实性的鲁棒性约束。同时引入电路读取程序，通过前向传播和梯度识别活跃通道并构建通道级图。

Conclusion: 该方法在最小输入级解释和驱动模型决策的内部计算机制理解之间建立了实用桥梁，实现了模型决策的忠实解释和内部机制的可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典学习主要关注单个样本的表示稀疏性，忽视了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能促进原子级稀疏性的方法。

Method: 引入基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的正则化项，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型，提供贝叶斯解释并建立超参数选择理论。

Result: 在基准数据集上，方法实现了20%的RMSE降低，使用不到十分之一的字典原子，显著提升了重建质量和表示稀疏性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过原子级稀疏性正则化有效解决了字典冗余问题，理论分析和实验验证都证明了其优越性能。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Conclusion: CPATTA成功将原则性的、覆盖保证的不确定性引入ATTA，显著提高了模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性和标注效率。

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Method: 使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练TSQA模型，利用深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能够成功使用伪标签进行训练，而且通过利用大量未标注数据，其性能超过了VLM本身。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据不足的问题，证明了使用VLM生成伪标签训练TSQA模型的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Motivation: 随着现实世界图的规模不断增大，直接处理变得越来越困难甚至不可行。针对大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练图神经网络并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中动态合并节点，而不是作为预处理步骤。

Result: 在同性恋和异性恋节点分类数据集上验证了该方法，并通过可视化节点嵌入与其对应聚类的关系，证明粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应具有挑战性的场景（如异性恋数据），并且节点聚类可以根据学习任务进行调整，而不依赖于图连接性和特征。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法存在局限性：无训练方法依赖手动调参，训练方法主要对齐参数而非下游任务行为，且通常忽略层间异质性。需要一种更有效的多专家模型合并方案。

Method: Expert Merging使用少量未标注校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化，加入系数正则化和任务加权损失。Expert Merging++进一步引入重要性引导分块，基于学习系数、任务向量大小和参数数量分配分块系数。

Result: 在MLLM骨干（InternVL和Qwen2-VL）和LLM骨干（Mistral）上，该方法超越了强基线，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过了监督混合训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方案，在LLM和MLLM上表现出色。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

Result: 在长尾基准测试中优于现有流匹配基线，在平衡数据集上保持竞争力

Conclusion: UOT-RFM能有效缓解多数类偏差，无需类别标签即可改善尾部类别生成质量

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏差问题，显著提升了验证结果的可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，其安全漏洞日益受到关注。机器遗忘旨在通过移除不良数据的影响来缓解这些风险，但现有方法不仅依赖保留数据集来保持模型效用，还在连续遗忘请求下遭受累积的灾难性效用损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证实，该方法无需保留数据集即可实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续机器遗忘中的关键挑战，在不依赖保留数据集的情况下实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: 解决PPO-based RLHF训练管道中由于顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 引入两种新技术：1) 内部步骤重叠，将上游模型输出流式传输到下游模型；2) 跨步骤重叠，自适应地过度提交提示并推迟长生成。

Result: OPPO加速PPO-based RLHF训练1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提升1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个高效、轻量级且模型无关的框架，只需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

Motivation: 现有聚类方法假设实体被动服从分组，但现实中实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设关联，这会显著改变聚类结果并影响下游推理和决策。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火程序，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出了自适应距离估计网络（ADEN），这是一个基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 实证结果显示该框架与底层数据动态紧密对齐：即使没有明确的自主性模型，也能获得接近真实情况的解（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致更大差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能够有效学习和适应实体局部自主性对聚类的影响，显著提升聚类性能，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，智能体可以在在线学习中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常需要成本，需要平衡潜在收益。研究如何在在线学习中优化动作选择和生成时机，解决利用、探索和创建之间的三角权衡问题。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成。算法允许在任何时间步生成新动作，一次性成本支付后该动作永久可用。

Conclusion: 该研究首次为扩展动作空间的在线学习提供了次线性遗憾界，提出的双重乐观算法有效解决了动作生成成本与收益的平衡问题，为动态动作生成场景提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Conclusion: 中训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最为有效，强调了在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间中进行操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Motivation: 当前LLM强化学习方法采用均匀探索预算分配，导致简单任务持续成功、困难任务持续失败，两者在GRPO训练中都产生零梯度，阻碍模型学习。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO中，该方法将非零策略梯度的有效比例提高了20-40%，能为特别困难的问题分配更大预算（如93次rollout），在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将学习饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务上，相比传统均匀分配方法，达到相同性能可节省约2倍计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Method: 提出了自适应采样和响应重用两种技术：自适应采样动态分配更多响应给困难提示，节省简单提示的计算；响应重用利用之前生成的正確响应提供训练信号。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO一致优于GRPO，与DAPO相当或更好，采样成本降低高达4.2倍；在32B模型上，AR3PO与DAPO性能相当但采样成本显著更低。

Conclusion: AR3PO通过采样效率的提升，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了强化学习后训练的计算成本，为大规模语言模型的优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST是一种完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，将大语言模型转换为硬件友好的半结构化稀疏模式，显著减少推理延迟和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏感知训练能有效减少大语言模型推理时的延迟和内存消耗，但现有方法通常分别优化稀疏模式和权重，缺乏联合优化能力。

Method: CAST包含三个核心组件：AdamS优化器（使用自适应L1衰减促进均匀稀疏化）、权重缩放模块（缓解衰减导致的幅度减少）、知识蒸馏（使用稠密模型作为自教师提升训练效率）。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数的各种模型上都显著优于现有方法。LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅使用2%原始预训练token，困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST框架能够高效训练高性能稀疏模型，建立了可靠的稀疏模型性能预测缩放定律，并在量化和微调场景中验证了实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于完全异步去中心化多玩家多臂老虎机问题的算法，通过自适应切换探索和利用阶段来应对无全局时钟和玩家动态变化的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统通常是去中心化和异步的，玩家可以随时进入或离开系统，且没有全局时钟。这带来了两个主要挑战：无法通过时间隐式协调行动以避免碰撞，以及检测玩家数量的高成本。

Method: 开发了一种新颖算法，玩家在探索和利用之间自适应切换。探索阶段均匀拉动臂以减少碰撞概率，同时以较小概率继续拉动其他玩家正在利用的臂来检测玩家离开。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾界，其中$\Delta$是任意两个臂之间期望奖励的最小差距。

Conclusion: 这是首个在异步去中心化环境中高效的多玩家多臂老虎机算法，实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发了基于Transformer的时尚可持续性信息工具FITS，使用BERT模型从可信文本源中提取和分类可持续性数据，帮助解决时尚行业信息稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚行业的可持续性信息有限且难以解读，通用语言模型缺乏领域知识且容易产生幻觉，在需要事实准确性的领域尤其有害。

Method: 使用多个基于BERT的语言模型，包括在科学和气候特定数据上预训练的模型，在精心策划的语料库上进行微调，采用领域特定分类模式，并通过贝叶斯优化优化超参数。

Result: 开发了FITS原型系统，允许用户搜索相关数据、分析自己的数据，并通过交互界面探索信息。在潜在用户焦点小组中评估了可用性、视觉设计、内容清晰度等方面。

Conclusion: 领域适应的NLP在促进知情决策方面具有价值，强调了AI应用在应对气候相关挑战方面的更广泛潜力，并提供了有价值的数据集和方法论。

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Kairos时间序列基础模型框架，通过动态分块标记化和实例自适应位置嵌入来解决时间序列信息密度不均的问题，在零样本基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列在不同时间点具有异质的信息密度，受系统状态和信号复杂度影响，而现有时间序列基础模型使用非自适应处理流程无法捕捉这种动态特性，限制了零样本场景下的建模能力。

Method: 开发了Kairos框架，包含动态分块标记化器（自适应选择标记化粒度）和实例自适应位置嵌入（为每个时间序列实例定制位置编码），在包含3000亿时间点的大规模可预测性分层时间序列语料库上训练，并在推理阶段采用多分块预测策略。

Result: 在两个常见的零样本基准测试（GIFT-Eval和时间序列库基准）上取得了卓越性能，参数量更少，在不同任务中持续超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理时间序列的异质信息密度，显著提升了时间序列基础模型在零样本场景下的性能，为时间序列分析提供了更灵活的建模框架。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)方法，通过权重平均来更新整个模型，在最大化泛化能力的同时最小化计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间域泛化问题，传统方法预测未来模型权重计算成本过高，而仅预测分类器层的方法限制了泛化能力。

Method: 1) 通过在单个时间域上微调领域无关的基础模型，同时约束权重变化，创建具有功能多样性但参数相似性的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时间权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2个TDG设置上的广泛实验表明，TEA比之前的TDG方法性能提升高达69%，同时效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过专家模型权重平均，有效解决了时间域泛化问题，在保持高效的同时显著提升了泛化性能。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强策略，通过生成语义不一致的多模态错位样本来解决模态不平衡问题，结合弱模态加权和难样本加权机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态而无法达到最佳性能，现有方法主要关注训练目标或优化过程，数据中心的解决方案研究不足。

Method: 提出MIDAS数据增强策略：1)生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2)使用单模态置信度进行标注；3)引入弱模态加权机制，动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4)提出难样本加权，优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试中，MIDAS显著优于相关基线方法，有效解决了模态不平衡问题。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据增强和加权机制，强制模型学习矛盾信号并充分利用弱模态，在多模态分类任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

TL;DR: TFPI通过引入ThinkFree操作，在RLVR训练中丢弃思维内容以减少推理时的token消耗，从而加速收敛、提高性能上限并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致巨大的计算成本。多阶段训练方法虽然能部分缓解，但初始上下文过短会导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: 提出TFPI方法，在RLVR中引入ThinkFree操作，通过直接附加</think>标记来显式丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用。使用ThinkFree适配的输入进行训练。

Result: TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到了更高的性能上限，并产生了更token高效的原因模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适配方法，无需专门的奖励或复杂的训练设计，就能显著提高训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

TL;DR: 提出Concrete Score Distillation (CSD)方法，通过离散分数匹配克服现有知识蒸馏方法中的softmax平滑问题和最优解集限制，在LLM蒸馏中实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法存在softmax平滑导致logit信息丢失的问题，而直接logit蒸馏又受限于logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出CSD方法，解决自回归LLM中离散分数匹配的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题，通过灵活加权对齐师生模型在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越现有KD方法，实现更好的保真度-多样性权衡，与策略技术结合产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了在LLM蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为知识蒸馏提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于模糊决策系统的空间感知可分离性驱动的特征选择方法S²FS，通过整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，在分类和聚类性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么无法直接与学习性能对齐评估标准，要么仅依赖非定向欧氏距离捕捉决策类间关系，这限制了它们澄清决策边界的能力。实例的空间分布对决策边界的清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出了S²FS框架，采用空间感知可分离性准则，结合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性。使用前向贪心策略迭代选择最具判别性的特征。

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S²FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上持续优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S²FS通过整合空间方向信息提供更全面的类别结构表征，有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，同时保持了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Conclusion: 强化学习引导的数据选择方法具有显著潜力，能够在严格数据预算下最大化模型下游性能

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

TL;DR: 提出AC-RL方法，通过交互训练视觉模型理解推理系统所需的信息，解决视觉数学推理中因视觉信息缺失导致的接口不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型为人类读者生成描述时，常常忽略推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: 使用自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过训练过程中的澄清请求揭示信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求，可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习，无需显式标注，就能有效学习视觉语言接口，将澄清视为隐式监督形式。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Motivation: 传统的策略梯度方法如PPO通常沿着单一随机梯度方向更新，忽略了参数空间的丰富局部结构。研究发现代理梯度与真实奖励景观相关性较差，而更高性能的解往往位于附近未探索区域。

Method: 提出了ExploRLer管道，与PPO和TRPO等on-policy算法无缝集成，系统性地探索代理on-policy梯度更新周围的未探索邻域。

Result: 在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下，ExploRLer在复杂连续控制环境中相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为强化on-policy强化学习提供了一种实用有效的方法，并为代理目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出MS-PAFL框架，通过模型分割和隐私放大技术解决联邦学习中差分隐私导致的精度下降问题，在强隐私保护下实现高精度模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习采用差分隐私保护客户端数据时，所需添加的噪声会显著降低模型精度，需要解决隐私保护与模型效用之间的平衡问题。

Method: 提出模型分割隐私放大联邦学习(MS-PAFL)，将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析表明MS-PAFL显著减少了满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证该框架在强隐私保证下能持续获得优越的隐私-效用权衡，训练出高精度模型。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL通过模型分割和隐私放大技术有效解决了联邦学习中差分隐私导致的精度下降问题，在保持强隐私保护的同时实现了高模型精度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于自主拉曼光谱分类的深度学习工作流，包含基线无关分类、池化控制鲁棒性、标签高效学习和恒定时间适应四个关键进展，旨在解决荧光基线、峰位移和有限标签等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星车、深海着陆器和野外机器人上的自主拉曼仪器需要处理被荧光基线、峰位移和有限地面实况标签扭曲的原始光谱，传统方法依赖背景校正和峰提取步骤，难以在自主部署中实现稳健分类。

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Result: 理论分析表明泛化界和认证鲁棒半径部分依赖于权重谱范数；实证结果验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过光谱正则化可以增强平滑多数投票分类器的认证鲁棒性，同时提供了理论保证和实证支持。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Conclusion: 挑战了完整状态访问的必要性，为非对称强化学习方法的设计开辟了新方向，这些方法既实用又理论可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾数据分布下能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Muon优化器在训练LLMs时优于Adam的机制，特别是在处理重尾数据分布时的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Transformer组件，从关联记忆角度解释Muon的优势，并在理论和实验上验证其在重尾数据下的表现。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据中能更有效地优化尾部类别，理论分析证实其能实现跨类别的平衡学习。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，在重尾分布下比Adam能更平衡有效地学习尾部类别。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Conclusion: DPSBA通过抑制结构和语义异常，实现了高效且隐蔽的图分类后门攻击，为图神经网络的安全性研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了PPO和GRPO中的剪裁机制对熵产生偏差：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准剪裁参数下，clip-high效应主导，导致熵减少。通过调整剪裁参数可以控制熵，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现突出，但容易发生熵崩溃，导致模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍探索和训练进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究PPO和GRPO中剪裁机制对熵的影响，并探索如何通过调整剪裁参数来控制熵。

Result: 发现剪裁机制独立于奖励信号影响熵：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准参数下clip-high效应主导，导致整体熵减少。

Conclusion: 剪裁机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，可以通过故意使用剪裁来控制熵，通过更激进的clip-low值可以增加熵、促进探索，防止熵崩溃。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

*Abdulkadir Celikkanat,Andres R. Masegosa,Mads Albertsen,Thomas D. Nielsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于宏基因组分箱的概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，能够更好地处理序列不确定性，在真实数据集上优于确定性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有宏基因组分箱方法使用确定性表示（如k-mer谱或大语言模型嵌入），无法捕捉DNA序列中固有的不确定性，这些不确定性源于物种间DNA共享和具有高度相似表示的片段。

Method: 开发了概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将每个DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，引入数据自适应度量来扩展可行潜在空间，提供嵌入可区分性的理论保证。

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分箱任务上优于确定性k-mer和基于LLM的嵌入方法，为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架能够更自然地建模序列级不确定性，通过引入数据自适应度量实现更灵活的分箱/聚类分离，为宏基因组分箱提供了改进方法。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了超维计算(HDC)在智能制造中的应用，发现HDC超参数与性能的关系在不同应用领域存在差异。通过信号质量监控和图像缺陷检测两个代表性任务，揭示了编码器类型、维度等参数对性能的影响规律，最终实现了比深度学习模型更快的推理速度和更低的训练能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗预算的设备端智能。HDC作为一种轻量级替代方案，但先前研究假设HDC超参数与性能的关系在不同应用中稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 通过分析CNC加工中的信号质量监控和LPBF中的图像缺陷检测两个任务，映射编码器类型、投影方差、超维维度和数据规模对准确性、推理延迟、训练时间和训练能耗的影响。建立了形式化复杂度模型来解释编码和相似性计算的趋势。

Result: 信号任务偏好非线性随机傅里叶特征编码，图像任务偏好线性随机投影编码。调优后的HDC模型在准确性上匹配或超过最先进的深度学习和Transformer模型，同时提供至少6倍更快的推理速度和40倍更低的训练能耗。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，调优后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。未来工作将实现自适应编码器和超参数选择，扩展评估到更多制造模式，并在低功耗加速器上验证。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Motivation: transformer模型在强化学习中的应用带来了新的可能性，但在模型无关在线RL中实现时面临不稳定性挑战，现有算法难以直接应用。

Method: 两阶段训练方法：第一阶段使用更稳定的Accelerator模型与环境交互，同时通过行为克隆训练transformer；第二阶段预训练好的transformer在完全在线设置中与环境交互。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型无关算法能加速transformer性能提升，使其以更稳定、快速的方式在线训练，显著降低计算需求。

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Motivation: 大语言模型的对齐仍然是自然语言处理中的核心挑战，现有偏好优化方法通常需要在训练时或通过提示进行干预，缺乏推理阶段的有效对齐方法。

Method: 提出了对齐感知解码(AAD)，该方法在推理阶段通过隐式奖励优化来增强模型对齐，仅需标准DPO设置，无需专门训练。

Result: AAD在多种对齐基准测试和不同模型规模下始终优于强基线方法，在数据受限情况下还能生成高质量合成数据来改进标准解码下的对齐效果。

Conclusion: AAD为模型对齐提供了一种实用的推理阶段解决方案，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下，能够有效提升模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Motivation: 现有方法将空间单元独立处理，忽略了城市结构的关联性，需要开发能够显式整合地理上下文的方法来改进非正规住区映射。

Method: 构建图结构将每个空间单元与其相邻单元连接，使用轻量级图卷积网络进行分类，通过空间交叉验证确保模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有的神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），容易过度平滑局部动态且计算成本高。FINO旨在通过严格局部性来保留精细结构并提高效率。

Method: FINO使用可学习的卷积核替代固定有限差分系数，通过局部算子块（包含微分模板层、门控掩码和线性融合步骤）构建自适应导数特征，并采用编码器-解码器结构。

Result: 在六个基准测试和气候建模任务中，FINO相比最先进的算子学习方法误差降低达44%，速度提升约2倍。

Conclusion: 严格的局部性与可学习时间步进相结合，为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Method: 使用ROBOD数据集，比较LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构在不同时间尺度上预测室内环境参数的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统提供了可行的预测性HVAC控制方案，有助于在实际建筑运营中降低能耗并提升居住舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

TL;DR: 提出Marginal Flow框架，通过将潜在参数w从可学习分布中采样并边缘化，克服现有密度建模方法在训练成本、推理速度、似然近似、模式崩溃和架构约束等方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理缓慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或双射映射等架构约束等缺陷，需要一种能同时克服这些局限性的新框架。

Method: 定义模型q_θ(x)为带潜在参数w的参数分布q(x|w)，通过从可学习分布q_θ(w)中采样w来边缘化潜在变量，实现高效密度评估和采样。

Result: 该模型允许精确密度评估，在训练和推理时比竞争模型快几个数量级，能学习低维流形上的分布，高效处理多模态目标，并在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个简单而强大的框架，无需神经网络架构限制，能灵活处理各种目标函数，有效解决现有密度建模方法的多种局限性。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

Motivation: 传统dQ/dV计算方法依赖有限差分和滤波，会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差，需要更可靠的析锂检测方法

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模Q(V)关系，利用GP导数仍是GP的特性，从后验分布中解析推断dQ/dV，提供概率性检测

Result: 在0.2C-1C倍率和0-40°C温度范围内的实验验证显示，该方法能可靠检测低温高倍率充电下的析锂峰值，在基准情况下正确报告无峰值

Conclusion: 该方法为实时锂电析锂检测提供了实用途径，通过GP识别的微分峰值、减少的充电容量和参考性能测试测量的容量衰减的一致性证实了其准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，导致资源浪费或漏检风险。需要灵活的安全监控，仅在输入难以评估或计算资源充足时增加成本。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，采用多项式训练和逐项评估。支持早期停止进行轻量监控，或使用更多项获得更强保护。提供安全调节和自适应级联两种使用模式。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集（WildGuardMix和BeaverTails）上，对4个参数达300亿的模型测试表明，TPCs在相同规模下与MLP探针基线竞争或表现更优，同时比黑盒方法更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs实现了灵活、高效的大语言模型安全监控，可根据需求动态调整计算成本，在保持性能的同时提高资源利用率和可解释性。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估，证明了可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为在观测数据之外审计和认证群体公平性提供了原则性基础，确保公平性评估在分布不确定性下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

TL;DR: 该论文将Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化应用于个体公平性问题，结合因果结构，提出了可计算的DRO对偶形式，将min-max问题转化为带正则化的优化问题，并在未知因果模型情况下提供了有限样本误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少将分布鲁棒优化应用于个体公平性，特别是在考虑因果结构和敏感属性的学习问题中。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 首先从因果和个体公平视角构建DRO问题，提出DRO对偶形式作为计算工具，将最坏情况损失量化为正则化项，消除min-max问题中的max步骤，并在未知因果模型情况下进行估计。

Result: 成功将DRO min-max问题转化为带正则化的优化问题，提供了可计算的解决方案，并在更一般情况下估计正则化项，建立了DRO与经典鲁棒优化的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理个体公平性问题，在未知因果结构情况下仍能保证学习效率和鲁棒性，为数据驱动决策提供了理论保证。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文评估了生成模型在物理系统仿真中的表现，重点比较了随机插值方法与传统的基于高斯去噪的方法，发现随机插值能更有效地处理物理系统的自回归预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型依赖高斯去噪方法，但在处理PDE和动力系统等物理系统的自回归预测任务时可能不是最有效的选择。需要探索更适合物理系统仿真的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值方法，直接学习当前状态与未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布之间的邻近性。这种方法比传输高斯噪声的方法需要更少的采样步骤。

Result: 实验表明随机插值方法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型产生更准确的预测，且采样步骤更少。生成模型需要在确定性精度、频谱一致性和概率校准之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 随机插值方法成为物理仿真的竞争性基准，为不同生成建模框架的能力提供了见解，通过调整采样策略可以满足物理仿真的多重需求。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低数据量模仿学习场景中，传统依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构的方法难以应用，需要更高效利用有限专家演示数据的方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计，实现简单易调。

Result: 在挑战性连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）中表现优异，在超低数据量下（仅20个转移）仍能取得良好性能。

Conclusion: NGT提供了一种简单高效的模仿学习解决方案，在低数据量场景下具有显著优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的方法来调优自动性能调优框架中优化算法的超参数，即"调优调优器"。通过统计方法评估超参数性能、发布可复现数据集和软件，以及使用仿真模式大幅降低调优成本，研究表明即使有限的超参数调优也能平均提升94.8%的自动调优性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优广泛应用于科学计算领域，但优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优过，其潜在性能影响也未被研究。超参数对优化算法效率至关重要，但在自动调优框架中却被忽视。

Method: 提出了一种通用的超参数调优方法，包括：1）跨搜索空间的稳健统计评估方法；2）发布FAIR数据集和软件确保可复现性；3）仿真模式重放历史调优数据，将超参数调优成本降低两个数量级。

Conclusion: 超参数调优作为常被忽视的技术，对自动性能调优具有显著提升作用。提出的方法能够高效优化超参数，为自动调优研究提供了新的方向和工具。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的解码策略——归因引导解码(AGD)，通过选择对用户定义感兴趣区域(ROI)具有最高归因的候选token来引导生成，显著提升指令遵循能力和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令遵循和生成事实准确文本方面存在不足，现有控制技术又常常会降低整体输出质量，需要一种更稳健的解码策略。

Method: AGD考虑一组高概率输出token候选，选择对用户定义ROI具有最高归因的token。ROI可以灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件的不同部分，支持自适应熵基变体以减少计算开销。

Result: 在指令遵循方面，将Llama 3.1的整体成功率从66.0%提升到79.1%；在知识密集型任务中，减少幻觉并提高闭卷和开卷设置中的事实准确性。

Conclusion: AGD提供了一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法来增强现代LLM的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Method: 采用统一术语和共同框架，将来自算法选择、参数调优、多启动和资源分配等不同研究领域的策略进行系统整合，并开发分类法来组织和分类这些策略。

Result: 成功构建了一个统一的框架和分类法，能够系统地组织和分类单问题多尝试优化中的顺序选择策略。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了单问题多尝试启发式优化领域综述的空白，为实践者提供了系统化的策略选择框架，有助于更高效地识别最佳解决方案。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法需要大量模型评估，成本高且不实用，特别是对黑盒模型访问受限时

Method: ACE算法使用自适应采样策略，优先选择信息量大的点，结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化来近似决策边界

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有最优方法，同时能识别最小且可行的特征变化

Conclusion: ACE是一种样本高效的反事实解释算法，在保持解释质量的同时显著减少模型查询次数

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Motivation: 信息瓶颈(IB)原理虽然为理解神经网络学习提供了理论框架，但其实际应用受到理论模糊性和估计困难的限制。

Method: 基于协同信息重新表述IB原理，使用平均交互信息(II)作为可计算的协同性定义，构建广义信息瓶颈(GIB)框架。

Result: GIB在各种架构(包括ReLU激活函数)中一致展现出压缩阶段，在CNN和Transformer中产生可解释的动态，并与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致。

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容性的同时，解决了其局限性，提供了更实用和可解释的信息瓶颈方法。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Motivation: Muon优化方法在神经网络训练中表现出比Adam等自适应方法更快的速度，但直接应用于联邦学习时由于LMO是偏差算子而不收敛，需要解决这一问题

Method: 提出FedMuon方法，通过近似求解LMO来缓解偏差问题，并分析不同Newton-Schulz迭代次数对收敛的影响

Result: 实验证明FedMuon优于现有最先进的联邦学习方法，且随着LMO求解精度提高收敛更快

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化器应用于联邦学习，解决了LMO偏差问题，实现了高效收敛和优越性能

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Motivation: LLM作为序列决策策略时，其广泛但通用的知识对于特定决策任务往往不足，特别是在任务相关数据有限的情况下，难以高效适应特定任务。

Method: 使用记忆存储过去交互和关联的Q值，捕获决策相关知识以促进准确的价值估计，并指导LLM先验的细化。细化的LLM先验生成更高奖励的轨迹来进一步丰富记忆，形成自改进循环。

Result: 在ALFWorld实验中，该方法显著优于传统RL和基于LLM的基线方法，在分布内任务上性能提升超过40%，在未见任务上泛化性能提升超过75%。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架通过结合LLM通用知识和领域特定经验，有效提升了序列决策任务的性能，特别是在数据有限和泛化场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更加可复现和可访问，是临床AI数据集民主化的重要一步。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Method: 使用离散流生成模型学习将均匀源分布转换为数据分布，采用混合方案结合遗传算法和近端属性优化微调策略，与掩码模型不同，其训练损失在每个去噪步骤考虑所有序列位置的预测。

Result: 在从头生成中实现了比先前片段模型更强的质量-多样性帕累托前沿，在Practical Molecular Optimization基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平，在先导化合物优化中获得了比先前基线更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现建立了多功能的生成基础，从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化，并通过发布预训练检查点和代码促进开放科学。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

*Ioannis Mavrothalassitis,Pol Puigdemont,Noam Itzhak Levi,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 梯度上升优化方法在机器遗忘任务中经常失败，原因是遗忘集和保留集之间存在统计依赖性，这种依赖性导致独立操作这两个数据集不可行，最终使遗忘过程反而损害模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，揭示基于梯度上升的无约束优化方法在机器遗忘中的失败现象，强调数据间统计依赖性的关键影响。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究遗忘集与保留集之间的统计依赖性，包括随机遗忘集和逻辑回归案例，展示梯度下降-上升迭代的失败模式。

Result: 发现梯度上升方法不仅无法达到理想重训练模型的效果，反而可能收敛到比原始模型更差的解，使遗忘过程产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 统计依赖性（即使只是相关性）足以导致基于上升的遗忘方法失败，这一理论见解在复杂神经网络实验中得到了验证。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了半自回归解码中固定块大小的假设，提出了基于置信度动态分析的AdaBlock-dLLM方法，通过自适应调整块大小来优化解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码使用固定块大小存在两个根本问题：延迟解码开销（高置信度令牌被不必要延迟）和过早解码错误（低置信度令牌过早提交）。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别出波动带区域，并开发了AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小以对齐语义边界。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅优化了推理时间性能，其语义感知的自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析有望启发未来dLLM的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过将每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，结合基于不纯度的评估和LLM反馈来生成透明可解释的分类决策路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景中，AI系统需要产生透明、可解释和可审计的决策。传统决策树虽然可解释性强但仅限于结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化数据但缺乏可验证的推理过程。

Method: 提出Agentic分类树(ACT)，将决策树的分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过不纯度评估和基于TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化问题表述。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT的性能达到或超过了基于提示的方法，同时产生了透明可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的可解释性优势扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险应用提供了既准确又透明的分类解决方案。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽了对零阶项的要求，从可求和条件变为平方可求和条件，并引入了关于随机过程增量的新假设，从而实现了对随机逼近和强化学习算法的收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可求和，但在许多重要的强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，因此需要扩展该定理以处理零阶项仅平方可求和的情况。

Method: 引入关于随机过程增量的新颖且温和的假设，结合平方可求和条件，证明几乎必然收敛到有界集，并提供收敛速率和高概率浓度界。

Result: 获得了Q学习与线性函数逼近的第一个几乎必然收敛速率、第一个高概率浓度界和第一个Lp收敛速率。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为分析更广泛的随机迭代算法提供了理论基础，特别是在强化学习领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在领域覆盖窄、忽视协变量、统计方法不严谨、缺乏一致评估基础设施等问题，阻碍了时间序列预测领域的持续进展。

Method: 构建包含100个预测任务的fev-bench基准，涵盖7个领域，其中46个任务包含协变量；开发轻量级Python库fev支持可重现评估；使用自助法置信区间和两种互补维度（胜率和技能分数）报告模型性能。

Result: 在fev-bench上评估了多种预训练、统计和基线模型，识别了有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench解决了现有基准的关键缺陷，提供了更全面、严谨的时间序列预测评估框架，促进了该领域的持续进步。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ是两种新的向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播的硬分配同时允许梯度流动，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化中的硬分配会阻断梯度，阻碍端到端训练，需要寻找既能保持量化效果又能支持梯度传播的方法。

Method: DiVeQ将量化建模为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ进一步将分配扩展到由码字连线构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务中，相比其他量化方法，这两种方法在多个数据集上都能改善重建质量和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ提供了有效的向量量化解决方案，无需辅助损失或温度调度即可实现端到端训练，在压缩和生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在处理分子和几何数据时具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖专门且计算昂贵的张量操作。

Method: 开发了tensor_frames包，基于PyTorchGeometric的局部正则化实现，可将任何标准消息传递神经网络轻松集成等变性。

Result: 在理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测准确性方面系统比较了不同等变表示，显著改善了运行时间。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将张量场网络转换为局部正则化范式，在保持等变性的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

*Xi Wang,James McInerney,Lequn Wang,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EAT（Entropy After </Think>）方法，通过监控推理过程中的熵值变化来检测和防止大语言模型过度思考，从而减少计算资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长链推理中倾向于过度思考，即使已得出正确答案仍继续修正，造成计算资源浪费。需要一种方法来检测和提前终止推理。

Method: 在推理过程中添加停止思考标记</think>，监控后续token的熵值变化轨迹，当熵值下降并稳定时（Pass@1达到平台期），使用指数移动平均的方差阈值作为停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少13-21%的token使用量，且不影响准确性。在黑盒设置下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: EAT方法能有效检测模型过度思考，自适应分配计算资源，提高推理效率，在多种设置下均表现良好。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，用于在异构联邦学习环境中对多任务多模态基础模型进行个性化微调，通过客户端-服务器模型架构不匹配和知识蒸馏来平衡通用知识和个性化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在去中心化环境中训练多个模型，但产生的最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求。现有研究对多任务多模态基础模型的个性化微调关注不足，特别是在数据、任务和模态都存在异构性的环境中。

Method: TAP方法包含两个阶段：(i) 利用客户端与服务器模型架构的不匹配，在有益于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；(ii) 在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，在不损害个性化的情况下捕获有益的通用知识。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法在各种数据集和任务上的有效性，优于多个基线方法。还提供了服务器模型在模态-任务对架构下的首次收敛性分析。

Conclusion: 随着模态-任务对数量的增加，服务器模型满足所有任务的能力会下降。TAP方法能有效解决异构联邦学习环境中的个性化问题，在保持通用知识的同时实现更好的个性化性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂且依赖性增强，电力系统成为复杂网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是新兴的不稳定性攻击目前缺乏有效防护措施。

Method: 使用监督机器学习模型，结合改进的Prony分析（MPA）来检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制，在IEEE 14总线系统上进行了概念验证。

Result: 通过Achilles Heel Technologies电力网格分析器的实现，证明MPA是检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种成本效益高的数据驱动防御方案，能够有效应对不稳定性攻击。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够根据训练好的神经网络来衡量数据点相似性的可解释性方法，帮助理解模型如何组织和分类数据。

Method: 构建损失核作为在低损失参数扰动分布下计算的样本损失协方差矩阵，首先在合成多任务问题上验证，然后应用于Inception-v1模型分析ImageNet数据。

Result: 在合成任务中成功分离不同任务的输入，在ImageNet上显示损失核结构与WordNet语义层次结构对齐，证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 损失核是一种实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络内部的数据组织方式。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种针对长上下文大语言模型的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，相比Ring Attention实现了最高3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列并行方法Ring Attention由于采用Ring AllGather通信原语与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，导致通信效率低下，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，同时将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验结果表明，TASP相比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑感知的序列并行方法有效解决了长上下文LLM中的通信瓶颈问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

TL;DR: 使用有限元框架生成合成胸主动脉瘤，通过神经网络预测初始损伤组合，发现结合扩张度和可扩张性数据能显著提高预测精度，UNet模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学损伤引起，不同损伤造成不同的机械脆弱性，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和可扩张性的空间图，训练神经网络预测初始损伤组合，比较多种网络架构和数据格式。

Result: 仅使用扩张度数据时预测误差显著更高，结合扩张度和可扩张性数据能提高预测精度；在所有测试模型中，UNet在所有数据格式下均提供最高准确度。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张度和可扩张性的全场测量数据对于揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素和开发个性化治疗策略至关重要。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

### [386] [Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26578)
*Zheng Zhang,Ziwei Shan,Kaitao Song,Yexin Li,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时序过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与前序步骤和最终结果关联，解决现有过程奖励模型的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)要么孤立处理推理步骤，无法捕捉步骤间依赖关系；要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题。

Method: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)，将LLM推理建模为导致正确答案的时序过程。每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联，通过强制执行条件概率规则来捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习等实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，无需依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励即可实现稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过一致的概型建模实现更可靠的跨样本比较，解决了过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于适当评分规则的统一回归不确定性量化框架，推导了参数假设下的闭式表达式，并展示了如何通过模型集成进行估计。该框架自然地将不确定性分解为偶然性和认知性成分，恢复了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用中的可靠决策至关重要。虽然UQ理论在分类任务中取得了显著进展，但将这些思想扩展到回归任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（如CRPS、对数评分、平方误差和二次评分）构建统一回归UQ框架，在实用参数假设下推导闭式表达式，并使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 推导出的不确定性度量自然分解为偶然性和认知性成分，恢复了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量。在合成和真实世界回归数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠的UQ度量提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该工作为回归任务提供了一个基于适当评分原则的统一不确定性量化框架，能够可靠地分解不确定性成分，并为实际应用中的UQ度量选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

TL;DR: LLMs通过纯文本预训练意外地发展出丰富的视觉先验知识，这些先验由可分离的感知和推理先验组成，具有不同的扩展趋势和来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在纯文本预训练中如何发展视觉先验，理解这些先验的组成和来源，为构建下一代多模态LLMs提供指导。

Method: 通过100多个受控实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖完整的MLLM构建流程，包括LLM预训练、视觉对齐和多模态微调，分析了不同数据类别和混合比例的影响。

Result: 发现推理先验主要由推理中心数据（代码、数学、学术文本）发展而来，可迁移到视觉推理；感知先验则来自广泛语料，对视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据更敏感。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于数据中心的预训练方法，用于从语言预训练中有意识地培养视觉先验，为下一代多模态LLMs的发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出递归自聚合（RSA）方法，结合并行和顺序推理的优势，通过迭代聚合候选推理链来提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法要么采用并行推理（选择多个独立解），要么采用顺序推理（自我精炼），但都未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。RSA旨在结合两者的优势，通过利用推理链中的中间步骤信息来提升模型性能。

Method: RSA通过迭代方式精炼候选推理链：每一步聚合子集以产生改进的解群体，作为下一轮的候选池。该方法充分利用推理链中的信息，包括部分正确的中间步骤，实现不同思维链之间的引导。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都带来了显著的性能提升。Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507使用RSA后能与更大的推理模型竞争，在AIME-25、HMMT-25等多个基准测试中优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，通过结合并行和顺序推理的优势，充分利用推理链信息，显著提升模型性能。通过聚合感知的强化学习方法训练模型进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

TL;DR: AccidentBench是一个大规模多模态基准测试，结合车辆事故场景和航空、水域等安全关键场景，包含约2000个视频和19000个标注问答对，用于评估模型在真实世界安全关键环境中的时空推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，需要能够严格评估在安全关键、动态真实世界环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。现有基准无法充分测试模型在复杂时空推理任务上的表现。

Method: 构建包含车辆事故场景和航空、水域安全关键场景的大规模数据集，涵盖不同视频长度（短/中/长）和难度级别（简单/中等/困难），系统性地测试时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最困难任务和最长时间视频上，最强模型也仅达到约18%的准确率，揭示了在真实世界时空和意图推理方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在暴露这些关键差距，推动开发更安全、更稳健、更符合真实世界安全关键挑战的多模态模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are
available at: https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/AccidentBench

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPATA是一种确定性方法，可将表格数据集转换为统计模式的领域无关表示，用于生成更详细透明的数据卡片，支持在不泄露数据的情况下进行AI模型鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型易受数据扰动和对抗样本影响，但传统鲁棒性评估需要访问训练和测试数据，这会带来数据隐私和机密性风险。需要一种方法能在不披露私有数据集的情况下进行外部验证。

Method: SPATA方法将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中，生成统计模式的领域无关表示。这些投影后的数据集可用于分析和比较，而不会造成数据泄露。

Result: 该方法能够可靠地评估不同特征对ML模型鲁棒性的影响，并生成模型行为的可解释性说明。

Conclusion: SPATA通过提供透明的数据表示，有助于建立更值得信赖的AI系统，支持在不泄露敏感数据的情况下进行外部验证和鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

*George Gui,Seungwoo Kim*

Main category: econ.EM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实验设计阶段，研究人员面临众多协变量时，如何有效选择或加权协变量来创建分层存在挑战。

Method: 利用大语言模型合成高维协变量数据，结合标准分层方法改进实验设计。

Result: 在实证应用中，该方法相比简单随机化可将处理效应估计的方差减少10%-50%。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模拟是协变量丰富环境中改进实验设计的实用且易于实施的方法。

Abstract: Pre-experiment stratification, or blocking, is a well-established technique
for designing more efficient experiments and increasing the precision of the
experimental estimates. However, when researchers have access to many
covariates at the experiment design stage, they often face challenges in
effectively selecting or weighting covariates when creating their strata. This
paper proposes a Generative Stratification procedure that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize high-dimensional covariate data to improve
experimental design. We demonstrate the value of this approach by applying it
to a set of experiments and find that our method would have reduced the
variance of the treatment effect estimate by 10%-50% compared to simple
randomization in our empirical applications. When combined with other standard
stratification methods, it can be used to further improve the efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that LLM-based simulation is a practical and
easy-to-implement way to improve experimental design in covariate-rich
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归断点设计的外部有效性对政策制定至关重要，但现有实证研究中很少明确处理标准RD效应的外部有效性问题。

Method: 基于Calonico等(2014)和Dong与Lewbel(2015)的工作，提出了简单的联合推断程序，并引入了局部线性处理效应假设来增强处理效应导数的可解释性。

Result: 建立了识别结果并推导了外推处理效应的统一置信带，该方法不需要额外的协变量或设计特征，适用于几乎所有RD设置。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了实证RD研究的政策相关性，并通过实证应用证明了其与现有方法的互补性。

Abstract: The external validity of regression discontinuity (RD) designs is essential
for informing policy and remains an active research area in econometrics and
statistics. However, we document that only a limited number of empirical
studies explicitly address the external validity of standard RD effects. To
advance empirical practice, we propose a simple joint inference procedure for
the RD effect and its local external validity, building on Calonico, Cattaneo,
and Titiunik (2014, Econometrica) and Dong and Lewbel (2015, Review of
Economics and Statistics). We further introduce a locally linear treatment
effects assumption, which enhances the interpretability of the treatment effect
derivative proposed by Dong and Lewbel. Under this assumption, we establish
identification and derive a uniform confidence band for the extrapolated
treatment effects. Our approaches require no additional covariates or design
features, making them applicable to virtually all RD settings and thereby
enhancing the policy relevance of many empirical RD studies. The usefulness of
the method is demonstrated through an empirical application, highlighting its
complementarity to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二元组效应能更真实地表示网络中对维度（如进口商-出口商、进口商-产品、出口商-产品）的异质性，但大量固定效应会产生严重的偶然参数问题。

Method: 采用条件似然方法，通过以六元组（涉及网络每个部分两个节点的连接）作为充分统计量来消除固定效应，提出六元组logit估计器。

Result: 证明了估计器的一致性和渐近正态性，发现二元组异质性改变了信息积累方式，网络可能产生无限链接但渐近零信息连接，推导了稀疏性阈值。

Conclusion: 二元组异质性限制了在数据集中可以使用的粒度或分解程度，具有重要的实际意义。

Abstract: We study estimation and inference for triadic link formation with dyad-level
fixed effects in a nonlinear binary choice logit framework. Dyad-level effects
provide a richer and more realistic representation of heterogeneity across
pairs of dimensions (e.g. importer-exporter, importer-product,
exporter-product), yet their sheer number creates a severe incidental parameter
problem. We propose a novel ``hexad logit'' estimator and establish its
consistency and asymptotic normality. Identification is achieved through a
conditional likelihood approach that eliminates the fixed effects by
conditioning on sufficient statistics, in the form of hexads -- wirings that
involve two nodes from each part of the network. Our central finding is that
dyad-level heterogeneity fundamentally changes how information accumulates.
Unlike under node-level heterogeneity, where informative wirings automatically
grow with link formation, under dyad-level heterogeneity the network may
generate infinitely many links yet asymptotically zero informative wirings. We
derive explicit sparsity thresholds that determine when consistency holds and
when asymptotic normality is attainable. These results have important practical
implications, as they reveal that there is a limit to how granular or
disaggregate a dataset one can employ under dyad-level heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 该框架为RD设计中的说服效应分析提供了系统的方法论基础，具有实证应用价值。

Abstract: We develop a framework for identifying and estimating persuasion effects in
regression discontinuity (RD) designs. The RD persuasion rate measures the
probability that individuals at the threshold would take the action if exposed
to a persuasive message, given that they would not take the action without
exposure. We present identification results for both sharp and fuzzy RD
designs, derive sharp bounds under various data scenarios, and extend the
analysis to local compliers. Estimation and inference rely on local polynomial
regression, enabling straightforward implementation with standard RD tools.
Applications to public health and media illustrate its empirical relevance.
