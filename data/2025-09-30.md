### [1] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的无监督方法来评估内容审核模型对弱势群体的偏见，使用保形预测技术计算不确定性作为偏差代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在内容审核中存在种族和社会偏见问题，现有基于性能的指标难以准确衡量模型公平性，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 使用保形预测技术计算模型不确定性，分析11个模型对女性和非白人标注者的偏见程度，并与F1分数等性能指标进行对比。

Result: 研究发现某些预训练模型对少数群体标签预测准确率高但置信度低，表明这些群体在模型中的代表性不足。

Conclusion: 通过测量模型置信度可以识别哪些标注者群体在预训练模型中代表性更好，为模型去偏过程提供指导。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [2] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval基准评估了21个闭源和开源LLM在6个现实领域和9种残疾类型上的表现，发现对残疾相关查询的回应更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究LLM在不同残疾情境下的处理差异，揭示模型行为中存在的持续性能力主义偏见。

Method: 使用成对的中性和残疾感知查询，在6个现实领域评估21个LLM，通过情感、社会感知和事实准确性指标分析模型输出。

Result: 残疾感知查询的回应语气更负面、刻板印象增加、事实错误率更高，听力、言语和行动障碍受到的影响尤为严重。

Conclusion: 这些差异反映了模型行为中根深蒂固的能力主义偏见，强调了在日常应用中减轻偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [3] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RAR²框架，联合优化推理增强检索和检索增强推理，通过构建思维过程来揭示隐含知识需求，指导检索和答案生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理需要深度推理的复杂医学问题时表现不足，表面级输入无法反映任务真实知识需求，且缺乏对推理过程的显式建模。

Method: 构建混合偏好对训练数据集，应用直接偏好优化(DPO)训练模型，并设计了两种测试时扩展策略来探索框架边界。

Result: 在多个生物医学问答数据集上的实验表明，RAR²优于有或无微调的RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: RAR²框架通过联合优化推理和检索过程，有效提升了处理复杂医学问题的能力，展示了在真实临床任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [4] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench是一个专门为LLM生产力助手设计的新基准测试，通过多语言输入、隐式约束和多轮对话等复杂场景，对模型进行更真实和严格的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM真实世界指令跟随能力方面存在不足，包括缺乏足够的多语言性、未能捕捉用户请求中的隐式约束，以及忽视多轮对话的复杂性。

Method: 引入TRUEBench基准，包含12种语言的输入提示、多语言指令、严格的评估标准以捕捉显式和隐式约束，以及具有累积约束和上下文切换的复杂多轮对话场景，并使用LLM验证器精炼约束。

Result: 广泛实验表明TRUEBench比现有基准更具挑战性，即使是像OpenAI o1这样的强模型也只达到69.07%的总体通过率。

Conclusion: TRUEBench为LLM在实际生产力环境中的能力提供了严格而真实的评估，突显了它们的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF)框架，通过自适应注意力机制融合文本和声学特征，无需微调编码器即可在多模态情感分析中超越单模态和静态融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感分析仅依赖文本，忽略了声音语调等非语言线索，无法准确捕捉真实情感意图。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型的冻结文本嵌入和语音编码器的声学特征，通过自适应注意力机制为每个话语动态加权不同模态。

Result: 在大型多模态基准测试中，DAF模型在F1分数上显著提升，预测误差降低，动态加权策略对建模复杂情感输入至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合语言和非语言信息，该方法为情感预测提供了更稳健的基础，对情感计算应用具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [6] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样的方法，通过轻量级采样器层在单个全模型前向传递中生成多个token，平衡了生成质量与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型按顺序采样token，能保证从正确联合分布中采样，但速度慢。扩散模型可以并行生成token但偏离真实联合分布，导致质量下降。需要一种方法在保持速度的同时近似联合采样。

Method: 在现有大型扩散LM上添加轻量级单层采样器，一次全模型前向传递后，采样器层进行多次前向传递来生成多个token。采样器被训练来模拟冻结全模型的精确联合采样。

Result: 在Dream-7B模型上验证有效，当每个去噪步骤解掩4个token时，MAUVE得分达到0.87（基线为0.31），显著提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样，在保持生成速度的同时显著提升了生成文本的质量和准确性。

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [7] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了无痛激活引导(PAS)，一种完全自动化的激活引导方法，无需手动构建提示对或特征标注，可直接使用标注数据集进行模型行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的权重微调和提示工程方法分别存在耗时昂贵和难以精确控制的问题，而传统激活引导方法需要手动构建提示对或特征标注，使用不便。

Method: PAS通过自动化的方式构建激活向量，无需人工干预，可以直接使用任何给定的标注数据集进行训练，生成轻量级的激活向量用于模型行为控制。

Result: 在3个开源模型和18个任务上的评估显示，PAS能可靠提升行为任务性能（偏见任务提升10.1%，道德任务提升5.2%，对齐任务提升34.8%），但对智能导向任务效果有限，且能在上下文学习和监督微调基础上提供额外增益。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种快速、轻量、实用的语言模型后训练选项，明确了激活引导方法的适用场景和部署方式。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [8] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MIRAGE基准来评估多跳问答中的歧义处理能力，并开发了CLARION框架来应对这一挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答往往涉及与推理过程不可分割的歧义性，这给现有大语言模型带来了显著挑战

Method: 构建了包含1,142个高质量歧义多跳问题的MIRAGE基准，并提出了CLARION多智能体框架来处理歧义

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型在MIRAGE上也表现不佳，而CLARION框架显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 歧义解析与多步推理的结合是一个独特且重要的挑战，需要更自适应和鲁棒的推理系统

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

### [9] [ML2B: Multi-Lingual ML Benchmark For AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22768)
*Ekaterina Trofimova,Zosia Shamina,Maria Selifanova,Artem Zaitsev,Remi Savchuk,Maxim Minets,Daria Ozerova,Emil Sataev,Denis Zuenko,Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ML2B是首个多语言机器学习代码生成基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛的13种语言翻译版本，揭示非英语任务性能下降15-45%的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习代码生成基准主要局限于英语，忽视了机器学习研究和实践的全球多语言特性，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建ML2B基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛翻译成13种自然语言，涵盖表格、文本和图像数据类型，使用AIDE自动化框架进行端到端评估。

Result: 结果显示在非英语任务上存在显著的15-45%性能下降，揭示了多语言表示学习在代码生成中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: ML2B基准、评估框架和全面结果已通过GitHub仓库公开，以促进多语言机器学习代码生成的未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [10] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文构建了首个多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估多种TTS模型发现FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅依赖单一TTS模型可能限制泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式文本转语音模型的发展，区分真实和合成语音变得困难，特别是对于研究较少的阿拉伯语及其多种方言。现有伪造检测研究主要集中于英语，阿拉伯语存在显著研究空白。

Method: 采用评估流程：1）使用嵌入方法和分类器头训练分类器；2）对MFCC特征应用经典机器学习算法；3）使用RawNet2架构；4）基于人工评分的平均意见得分；5）通过自动语音识别模型处理原始和合成数据集以测量词错误率。

Result: FishSpeech在Casablanca语料库的阿拉伯语语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，产生更真实和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。

Conclusion: FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅使用单一TTS模型构建数据集可能限制泛化能力，建议考虑合并多个模型的音频。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

### [11] [EditGRPO: Reinforcement Learning with Post -Rollout Edits for Clinically Accurate Chest X-Ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22812)
*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO是一种混合策略强化学习算法，专门用于通过临床动机奖励优化放射学报告生成，解决了传统监督微调与临床效果不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成中，其监督微调目标与临床效果未明确对齐，需要开发更有效的优化方法。

Method: 提出EditGRPO混合策略强化学习算法，结合在线策略探索和离线策略指导，在训练过程中注入句子级详细修正，解决RL中的探索困境和采样效率问题。

Result: 在四个主要胸部X光报告生成数据集上，EditGRPO相比SFT和普通GRPO基线平均提升3.4%的性能指标，在未见数据集上平均提升5.9%。

Conclusion: EditGRPO通过临床动机奖励有效优化了放射学报告生成，在性能和泛化能力方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [12] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)方法，通过让模型对(问题，解决方案)对生成批判，仅基于最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致来给予奖励，结合RL和CRL训练Critique-Coder模型，在代码生成和逻辑推理任务上优于仅使用RL的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习主要关注生成回答，缺乏显式培养批判或反思的机制。受CFT和CGD等研究启发，希望开发能显式教授LLMs如何进行批判的方法。

Method: 提出CRL方法，模型为给定的(问题，解决方案)对生成批判，奖励仅基于最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致。在此基础上开发Critique-Coder模型，用20%的CRL数据替换标准RL数据进行混合训练。

Result: Critique-Coder在所有评估基准上持续优于仅使用RL的基线模型。Critique-Coder-8B在LiveCodeBench(v5)上达到60%以上，优于DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1。在BBEH数据集的逻辑推理任务上也表现更好。

Conclusion: CRL作为标准RL的补充，在编码数据集上的应用增强了通用推理和批判能力，这些能力可迁移到广泛任务中。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [13] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject攻击通过模仿聊天模板格式和多轮对话策略，显著提高了对LLM代理的间接提示注入攻击成功率，现有防御方法对此类攻击效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的代理与外部环境交互的部署增加，出现了新的攻击面。传统研究主要关注纯文本注入攻击，但LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖及其在上下文操纵中的脆弱性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ChatInject攻击，将恶意载荷格式化为原生聊天模板形式，利用模型的指令遵循倾向；开发多轮对话变体，通过多轮对话引导代理接受可疑操作。

Result: ChatInject在AgentDojo和InjecAgent上的平均攻击成功率分别从5.18%提升至32.05%和从15.13%提升至45.90%；多轮对话在InjecAgent上达到52.33%成功率；聊天模板载荷具有跨模型可迁移性；现有防御方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前代理系统存在严重漏洞，聊天模板格式和多轮对话策略的攻击方式对现有防御构成重大挑战，需要开发更有效的防护机制。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong

*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RSM-DCK模型，通过检测上下文和知识的相关部分来改进多轮对话中的响应选择，解决了传统方法中无用信息干扰匹配过程的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式对话系统将所有上下文和知识内容都用于匹配响应候选，但实际上不同部分的重要性不同，过多无用信息会影响匹配性能。

Method: 使用最近上下文作为查询，在词级和话语级语义上预选相关上下文和知识部分；让响应候选分别与选定的上下文和知识交互；最后利用上下文和响应候选的融合表示更自信地后选相关知识部分进行匹配。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的评估结果表明，该模型优于现有方法，并能有效检测用于响应选择的相关上下文和知识。

Conclusion: RSM-DCK模型通过检测相关上下文和知识部分，显著提升了多轮对话中响应选择的性能。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

### [15] [Towards Generalizable Implicit In-Context Learning with Attention Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22854)
*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出In-Context Routing(ICR)方法，在注意力logits层面内部化可泛化的ICL模式，实现零样本成本下的少样本性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式上下文学习方法依赖注入偏移向量，无法充分利用ICL的结构机制且泛化能力有限

Method: 提取ICL过程中出现的可复用结构方向，使用可学习的输入条件路由器调节注意力logits，实现一次训练多次使用的框架

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上评估，ICR始终优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前方法，并在域外任务上表现出鲁棒泛化能力

Conclusion: ICR有望推动ICL实用价值的边界

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

*R. Alexander Knipper,Charles S. Knipper,Kaiqi Zhang,Valerie Sims,Clint Bowers,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究对45个大型语言模型进行了大规模认知偏见评估，分析了280万条响应，发现LLMs在17.8-57.3%的情况下表现出与人类相似的认知偏见行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地嵌入现实世界决策过程，需要检验它们是否表现出人类常见的认知偏见，这对确保AI决策的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 引入基于多选题的新型评估框架，与心理学家合作手工策划了220个决策场景数据集，提出了从人工编写场景模板生成多样化提示的可扩展方法。

Result: LLMs在锚定、可得性、确认、框架、解释、过度归因、前景理论和代表性等八种认知偏见中表现出偏见一致性行为。模型大小和提示特异性显著影响偏见易感性：更大模型（>32B参数）在39.5%情况下减少偏见，更详细提示使大多数偏见减少达14.9%。

Conclusion: LLMs确实表现出系统性的认知偏见，模型规模和提示设计是减轻这些偏见的重要因素，这对开发更可靠的AI决策系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络和词汇表增强的阿拉伯语文档可读性预测方法，通过句子级图建模和后期融合策略提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更准确的阿拉伯语文档可读性预测系统，解决传统方法在捕捉复杂语言特征方面的局限性。

Method: 将文档建模为句子级图，节点包含句子和词元，边捕捉词汇共现和类别关系；使用SAMER词汇表特征和阿拉伯语transformer上下文嵌入；GNN和transformer作为独立分支训练，推理时通过后期融合结合预测结果。

Result: 混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于单独的GNN或transformer分支；GNN-only方法在句子级可读性精确预测方面表现更强。

Conclusion: 融合方法在文档级预测中具有优势，但GNN方法在句子级精确预测方面表现更佳，表明不同方法在不同粒度任务中各有优势。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEART是一个利用情感驱动提示进行迭代自我校正的新框架，通过基于六种基本情感的情感化反馈来指导语言模型改进推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放策略主要关注逻辑或结构优化，未能利用情感反馈的引导潜力。受心理学研究启发，情感可以调节认知表现，因此探索情感反馈对模型推理的促进作用。

Method: 使用基于Paul Ekman六种基本情感的情感化短语提供反馈，通过系统变化反馈的情感语调来引导模型摆脱错误推理路径，探索更优替代方案。

Result: 在Oracle验证器指导下，情感迭代协议能显著提升推理深度，在多个挑战性推理基准上持续大幅超越最先进基线。但在无验证器设置下难以稳定利用这些收益。

Conclusion: 机器推理的下一个前沿不仅在于逻辑精炼，还在于理解和利用模型的'内心'（情感方面），无验证器设置下的稳定性是未来工作的关键挑战。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ToMAgent(ToMA)，一种基于心理理论(ToM)的对话智能体，通过在对话回合间显式生成心理状态来提升对话效果和目标达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理理论是人类社交智能的关键方面，但现有聊天机器人和基于LLM的社交智能体通常不整合这一能力。研究表明显式使用ToM可以提升对话效果。

Method: 首先通过简单提示模型在对话回合间生成心理状态，然后引入ToMAgent，将ToM与对话前瞻配对训练，生成对达成对话目标最有用的心理状态。

Result: 在Sotopia交互社交评估基准上的实验表明，该方法优于多种基线方法。ToMA展现出更具战略性、目标导向的推理行为，能够进行长时程适应，同时与对话伙伴保持更好关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为整合心理理论构建社交智能LLM智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Method: 采用合成数据生成、基于LoRA的监督微调和通过GRPO的强化学习的组合方法，仅修改0.53%的模型权重（40.4M/7.66B参数）。

Result: 在1000个多样化文档提取任务基准测试中平均奖励达到0.573，显著优于GPT-4.1（0.457）、o3（0.464）和GPT-4.1-2025（0.459）。

Conclusion: 任务特定优化可以产生超越通用系统的模型，同时需要显著更少的计算资源。

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在药物相关任务中表现不佳，包括药物剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别和药物订单生成，需要领域特定训练和评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在药物相关任务中的一致性表现，包括药物剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别和药物订单生成，以了解其在医疗诊断中的实用性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o完成三个实验：药物名称到剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别（使用内部知识和网络搜索）、药物订单句子生成。通过余弦相似度、Levenshtein相似度、ROUGE指标和临床医生手动评估来量化准确性。

Result: GPT-4o在药物剂型匹配中表现差，49%的药物正确匹配所有可用剂型；药物相互作用识别中网络搜索表现优于内部知识（69.2% vs 54.7%），但无相互作用时网络搜索表现更差；药物订单句子生成中65.8%无错误。

Conclusion: 模型在所有测试中表现总体较差，突显了需要通过临床医生标注数据集进行领域特定训练和建立全面评估框架的需求。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Motivation: 利用生成式AI将文本故事转换为视觉插图，特别是通过LLM接口来增强文本到图像模型的提示效果，以生成更准确的故事场景插图。

Method: 使用LLM作为接口处理原始故事文本，生成适合文本到图像模型的提示，然后应用文本到图像模型生成场景插图，并通过人工标注获取质量评估。

Result: 创建了SceneIllustrations数据集，实验表明LLM能够有效表达故事文本中隐含的场景知识，这对生成和评估插图有重要影响。

Conclusion: LLM在跨模态叙事转换中具有重要作用，能够有效支持故事场景插图的生成和评估，为未来相关研究提供了新的资源和方法。

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在等量计算条件下，显式训练归纳电路并不能直接提升上下文学习能力。虽然Bi-Induct课程能加速小模型归纳头的出现，但自然文本训练的大模型在上下文学习任务中表现更好，表明功能必要性比单纯激活更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试在预训练中显式训练归纳电路是否能改善上下文学习，还是自然文本在等量计算下已足够。探索定向合成数据是否能加速归纳头出现并增强上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct轻量级课程，在预训练流中注入正向复制（归纳）、反向复制（反归纳）或平衡混合数据。在等量FLOPs下训练0.13B到1B参数模型，评估少样本上下文学习基准、头级遥测和语言建模困惑度。

Result: Bi-Induct在小规模加速归纳头出现，但不一致提升泛化能力。在标准语言模型基准上，Bi-Induct与纯自然训练相当；在函数式上下文学习探针中，1B纯自然模型表现最佳。自然训练的大模型发展出更广泛、更早的归纳头，无需显式归纳模式。

Conclusion: 诱导激活不足以保证上下文学习增益，关键在于这些电路是否变得功能必要。结果强调需要机制感知的预训练诊断和数据混合，以培养负载承载而非仅存在的结构。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

Motivation: 理解自监督语音模型在自然嘈杂环境中识别口语单词时所使用的语言表征类型，特别是这些模型如何处理语音和形态现象。

Method: 研究针对单词识别优化的S3M变体如何表征英语名词和动词常见变化的语音和形态现象，分析其表征的几何结构。

Result: 发现模型表征具有全局线性几何结构，可用于连接英语名词和动词及其规则变化形式，但这种结构不直接对应语音或形态单位，而是反映词汇中的分布关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现为支持人类口语单词识别的表征策略提供了候选方案，挑战了语音和形态需要独立语言表征的传统假设。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

TL;DR: 本文研究了表格表示形式对表格问答性能的影响，通过控制内容不变而改变结构，比较了不同建模范式在结构化与非结构化表格上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的表格问答需要处理结构化数据库和包含文本字段的半结构化表格，但现有基准测试受限于固定数据格式，未能系统研究表示形式本身对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用语言化管道生成配对的结构化和半结构化表格，引入诊断基准，按表格大小、连接需求、查询复杂度和模式质量进行划分，比较SQL方法、LLM和混合方法的表现。

Result: 实验显示一致的权衡：SQL方法在结构化输入上准确率高但在半结构化数据上表现下降，LLM具有灵活性但精度较低，混合方法在噪声模式条件下表现最佳，这些效应随着表格增大和查询复杂化而加剧。

Conclusion: 没有任何单一方法在所有条件下都表现出色，表格表示形式在塑造表格问答性能中起着核心作用，研究结果为模型选择和设计提供了实用见解，为开发适用于多样化现实世界数据格式的鲁棒混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Result: 生成了英语（平均每个模型864k词符，总计27M词符）和捷克语（平均每个模型768k词符，总计21.5M词符）的标注语料库，可通过捷克国家语料库搜索界面访问。

Conclusion: 创建了多类型、多主题的LLM生成文本语料库资源，为语言学比较研究提供了有价值的数据集，并在CC BY 4.0许可下开放使用。

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search

TL;DR: ReMemR1是一个带有回调增强记忆的内存增强代理，通过选择性检索整个记忆历史和支持非线性推理来解决长上下文问答中的信息分散问题，结合多级奖励强化学习提高训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在长上下文问答中面临的关键证据分散在数百万token中的挑战，现有方法存在不可逆的前向处理、信息覆盖丢失和稀疏强化学习信号等问题。

Method: 提出ReMemR1内存增强代理，支持回调增强记忆和选择性检索；设计多级奖励强化学习(RLMLR)，结合最终答案奖励和密集的步骤级信号。

Result: 在长文档问答实验中，相比现有基于内存的方法取得了显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ReMemR1通过缓解信息退化、改进监督和支持多跳内存利用，为长上下文推理代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs在MADS中的谄媚行为，提出了首个针对多智能体辩论系统的谄媚性操作框架，揭示了谄媚性是导致辩论失败的核心模式，并提出了设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的谄媚性倾向会破坏多智能体辩论系统的有效性，导致过早达成共识，影响辩论质量。现有研究主要关注用户-LLM谄媚性，而智能体间谄媚性在辩论中的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了首个操作框架：1) 为MADS设定正式定义谄媚性；2) 开发新指标评估智能体谄媚水平及其对信息交换的影响；3) 系统研究不同智能体角色中谄媚性水平对分散式和集中式辩论框架结果的影响。

Result: 发现谄媚性是核心失败模式：在达到正确结论前放大分歧崩溃；比单智能体基线准确率更低；源于不同的辩论者驱动和裁判驱动失败模式。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了可操作的设计原则，有效平衡智能体互动中的生产性分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有自评估方法在不可验证任务中存在计算开销大和过度自信问题，需要一种更轻量有效的自我改进方法。

Method: 提出语义投票机制，将硬匹配（精确匹配）放松为软匹配（语义相似度），使用轻量级句子嵌入模型量化语义相似度。

Result: 在多种模型架构和任务上，该方法在计算效率和整体性能上均优于自评估方法。

Conclusion: 语义投票为不可验证任务的自我改进提供了一种计算高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成代理开发缺乏过程级监督来有效指导任务分解、检索器调用和逐步决策能力，而强化学习存在稀疏奖励和LLM推理能力有限的问题。

Method: EviPath包含三个核心组件：溯因子任务规划（分解问题并规划最优解决路径）、忠实子问题回答（使用支持证据构建代理环境生成推理思路）和对话微调（将完整交互轨迹格式化为对话进行监督微调）。

Result: 在广泛使用的问答基准测试中，使用EviPath合成数据训练的8B参数模型显著优于最先进的基线方法，在开放域问答中实现了14.7%的绝对EM增益。

Conclusion: EviPath使LLM能够直接从合成数据中学习复杂推理和工具使用能力，为RAG代理开发提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在创意任务中的不确定性仍然是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的情况下。需要一种能够量化和分解不确定性并与人类创意变化校准的方法。

Method: 使用置信集（概率分布的凸包）的几何框架，分析WritingPrompts数据集中500个创意写作提示，每个提示有10个人类续写，评估4个语言模型和5种解码策略，生成100,000个故事。

Result: 置信集分析显示在捕捉人类创意变化方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅达到0.434。解码策略选择贡献了39.4%到72.0%的总认知不确定性。模型规模与校准质量相关性较弱，基础模型和指令调优模型在校准质量上没有显著差异。

Conclusion: 几何框架为改进生成系统以实现人机创意对齐提供了可操作的见解，并发布了完整的实验框架。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: 提出d²Cache训练自由近似KV缓存框架，通过两阶段细粒度选择策略识别和更新关键token的KV状态，显著提升扩散式大语言模型的推理效率，同时改善生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)由于依赖双向注意力机制，无法直接受益于标准KV缓存，导致推理效率低下。需要开发专门的缓存机制来加速推理。

Method: 提出双自适应缓存(d²Cache)框架，采用两阶段细粒度选择策略：识别关键token并自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存剩余token的KV状态以供重用。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream两个代表性dLLM上的实验表明，d²Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，还在生成质量上获得了一致性提升。

Conclusion: d²Cache为dLLMs提供了一种有效的推理加速解决方案，同时改善了生成可靠性，支持准从左到右生成并缓解序列末端token的过早过度自信问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

Motivation: 分子生成是药物发现和材料科学的关键，但LLMs在少样本设置下使用SMILES表示生成有效分子具有挑战性。

Method: 引入SmiSelf跨化学语言框架，使用语法规则将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES，利用SELFIES的机制来校正无效SMILES。

Result: SmiSelf确保100%有效性，同时保持分子特性，在其他指标上保持甚至提升性能。

Conclusion: SmiSelf扩展了LLMs在生物医学中的实际应用，与所有基于SMILES的生成模型兼容。

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理是实现LLM真正个性化能力的有效途径

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: TReASURe是一个基于树搜索的测试时对齐方法，通过UnmaskBranch分支策略和ResubstituteScore剪枝规则解决掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的两个关键挑战：并行解掩码导致高度相关分支和奖励评估的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将树搜索应用于掩码扩散语言模型时面临两个主要挑战：(i)并行解掩码产生高度相关的分支，限制了探索；(ii)通过采样完成进行奖励评估会产生高方差估计，导致剪枝不稳定。

Method: 提出TReASURe方法，包含：(i)UnmaskBranch分支策略，基于首次命中解掩码，通过每个父节点单次模型调用实现令牌内容和揭示顺序的多样化；(ii)ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，使用确定性重替换以低方差代理完成来评分部分掩码序列。

Result: 在困惑度、语言可接受性以及情感和毒性控制方面取得最先进的结果，在匹配计算预算下优于先前方法，在低NFE（函数评估次数）机制中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: TReASURe通过改进的分支策略和剪枝规则有效解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的关键挑战，在理论和实证上都证明了其优越性，特别是在计算资源受限的情况下。

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

Motivation: 现有LLM在扩展交互中性能下降，因为它们通常在静态单轮数据上训练，无法适应实时用户反馈。

Method: 提出T2PAM范式，利用用户反馈估计最优策略，然后更新少量参数；开发ROSA算法，通过单步高效更新引导模型参数朝向理论最优策略。

Result: 理论分析证明ROSA策略随交互次数增加收敛到用户偏好；大量实验显示在任务效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: T2PAM和ROSA有效解决了LLM在多轮交互中的适应性问题，实现了高效的自校正能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 受Chain-of-Thought（CoT）在测试时通过增加生成步骤提升性能的启发，探索是否可以在预训练阶段通过增加计算步骤来改善每个token的生成质量。

Method: 预训练语言模型先生成中间潜在思维（当前位置的最后一个隐藏状态），然后将该潜在思维作为输入来预测实际的下一个token，允许模型在无约束连续空间中优化其预测。

Result: 在相同推理成本下，生成一个额外潜在思维的1.4B模型性能超过了标准2.8B模型，在语言建模和各种下游任务上都表现更好。增加潜在思维数量（形成类似CoT的链）能持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在思维预训练方法能有效提升语言模型性能，在相同计算成本下优于更大参数的标准模型，且性能随潜在思维数量增加而持续改善。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个三阶段框架来解决LLM多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题：诊断(CRAS评分)、定位(注意力漂移分析)和对齐(SAIL手术式微调)，显著提升了指令层级合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在系统性故障模式：在指令冲突时智能体错误地优先处理系统级规则，而宏观指标无法有效识别这些微观违规行为。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) CRAS评分指标分解角色遵循度；2) 注意力漂移分析定位冲突解决层；3) SAIL手术式对齐，仅在定位层安装LoRA并使用令牌加权DPO目标优化。

Result: 在标准基准和多智能体框架上，该方法显著提高了指令层级合规性（如在AutoGen上MedQA任务提升5.60%），无需全模型微调。

Conclusion: 通过诊断-定位-对齐的三阶段框架，能够有效解决多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题，提升系统可靠性，为关键部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过眼动追踪和脑电图数据发现，在自然阅读中，短语结构构建先于语法类别检测，并且结构深度是影响阅读偏差的最主要因素，支持"树形支架"预测性理解模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用违反范式，将语法类别检测和短语结构构建两个过程混为一谈，并隐含假设短语结构构建在语法类别检测之后。本研究旨在在自然阅读条件下分离这两个过程并测试它们的时序关系。

Method: 使用ZuCo语料库中共同记录的EEG和眼动追踪数据，分析注视转移模式，采用贝叶斯网络建模，并研究固定相关电位。

Result: 注视转移分析显示读者优先在语法头部之间移动；贝叶斯网络模型表明结构深度是线性阅读偏差的最强驱动因素；固定相关电位显示语法惊奇度在单词出现前(-184到-10毫秒)和早期整合阶段(48到300毫秒)影响神经活动。

Conclusion: 短语结构构建可以优先于语法类别检测，并且在自然阅读中主导词汇影响，支持预测性的"树形支架"理解模型，扩展了当前关于语法时序的模型。

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理大语言模型在少样本思维链提示下表现不佳的悖论，探索演示数量增加反而降低准确性的原因。

Method: 提出Insight-to-Solve (I2S)方法，将演示转化为明确的、可重用的见解，并生成目标特定的推理轨迹；I2S+版本还包含自我精炼步骤以确保推理的连贯性和正确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，I2S和I2S+始终优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线方法，GPT-4.1在AIME'25上提升了14.0%，o1-mini在AIME和GPQA上分别提升了2.7%和1.7%。

Conclusion: 通过洞察-精炼-解决框架可以有效利用上下文演示，显著提升推理大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2017-2025年间登上Billboard Hot 100和Global 200榜单的K-pop歌曲，发现英语在成功的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，语码转换频繁，且没有显著的性别差异，但女性独唱歌手更倾向使用英语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究K-pop在全球成功背后的语言策略，特别是语码转换和英语歌词使用在全球化市场中的作用。

Method: 收集2017-2025年登上Billboard榜单的K-pop歌曲数据，分析英语和韩语歌词比例、语码转换频率等特征，并进行统计测试和分类任务预测表演者性别。

Result: 英语在全球成功的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，语码转换频繁；无显著性别差异，但女性独唱歌手更倾向英语；分类任务F1分数达0.76；Hot 100榜单对英语使用要求更高。

Conclusion: K-pop歌词的语言选择受全球市场压力影响，反映了表演者身份和榜单背景的风格模式，英语使用对在美国市场的成功更为关键。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

*Stefan Arnold,René Gröbner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究揭示了Gemma-2语言模型在处理介词短语时对工具性补语的偏好机制，通过调控单个注意力头可以改变补语功能角色的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型在生成介词短语时如何决定补语是作为工具性附加语还是属性修饰语的内在机制，这一决策过程目前尚不清楚。

Method: 构建包含with引导介词短语的提示集，通过将激活投影到词汇空间来识别偏好工具性补语的注意力头，然后缩放单个注意力头的值向量。

Result: 模型对工具性补语有强烈偏好（3:4比例），通过调控单个注意力头可以将工具性补语比例降至33%，同时将属性补语提升至36%。

Conclusion: 语言模型中存在特定的注意力头负责介词短语补语的功能角色分配，通过干预这些注意力头可以控制生成结果的功能分布。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

TL;DR: PARL-MT是一个用于多轮函数调用的LLM训练框架，通过显式整合进度感知能力来解决现有方法在长期任务执行中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么将多轮训练简化为孤立的单轮样本，忽略了任务级规划；要么使用端到端强化学习，存在冗余问题且缺乏明确的进度感知整合。

Method: PARL-MT包含两个核心组件：(1) 进度感知生成(PAG)管道，自动构建结合对话摘要和未来任务规划的数据集；(2) 进度感知引导强化学习(PAG-RL)算法，将进度感知整合到RL训练中。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试上的实证结果表明，PARL-MT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 进度感知在实现稳健高效的多轮函数调用方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Motivation: 维基百科作为最大的开放知识语料库，被广泛用于训练大语言模型和检索增强生成系统，确保其准确性至关重要。但维基百科的准确性如何以及如何改进它？

Method: 提出了CLAIRE系统，结合LLM推理与检索来发现潜在不一致的声明，并提供上下文证据供人工审核。通过随机抽样和CLAIRE辅助分析创建了WIKICOLLIDE基准数据集。

Result: 在用户研究中，87.5%的维基百科编辑报告使用CLAIRE时信心更高，参与者在相同时间内识别出64.7%更多的不一致性。研究发现至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实存在矛盾，这些不一致性传播到7.3%的FEVEROUS和4.0%的AmbigQA示例中。

Conclusion: 矛盾是维基百科中可测量的组成部分，基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE可以为编辑提供实用工具，帮助大规模改进知识一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Motivation: 金融对话记录存在非正式结构、领域特定词汇和可变意图密度等独特挑战，需要专门的信息提取方法。

Method: 使用领域自适应BERT作为主干，结合LoRA适配器进行高效微调；采用两阶段渐进解冻训练策略；基于概率曲率的动态阈值方法。

Result: 在真实世界对话记录上表现出强大的精确度和F1分数，输出可解释性强，适用于下游审计和问答工作流。

Conclusion: Fin-ExBERT提供了一个可部署的金融对话挖掘解决方案，支持批量评估、可视化和校准输出。

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

TL;DR: 提出A2D方法，通过token级对齐使扩散大语言模型在检测到有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，有效防御任意解码顺序和预填充攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的任意顺序生成特性扩大了攻击面，有害内容可能出现在任意位置，且模板预填充攻击能绕过响应级拒绝机制。

Method: 采用token级对齐方法，在随机掩码条件下将安全性直接对齐到token级别，使模型在有害内容出现时发出[EOS]拒绝信号。

Result: A2D在安全基准测试中持续阻止有害输出生成，将DIJA攻击成功率从80%以上降至接近零，并实现高达19.3倍的快速安全终止。

Conclusion: A2D方法通过token级对齐实现了对任意解码顺序和预填充攻击的鲁棒性，同时支持实时监控和早期拒绝，显著提升扩散大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政策合规评估需要专家进行系统性的逐步推理，但获取专家级推理过程的黄金标准文档成本高昂。

Method: 引入Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT)，这是一种专门的生成推理链，作为推理桥梁来改进LLM的政策合规评估能力。

Result: 在推理时和训练时使用PRT显著提升了开源模型和商业模型的性能，在HIPAA和GDPR政策上达到了新的SOTA。

Conclusion: PRT不仅能提高准确性，还能增强LLM准确引用政策条款的能力，并通过原始思维链的高利用率影响合规决策。

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Method: SIE框架从大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，利用丰富的组合模式支持泛化推理，通过显式模式和推理链实现基于规则的可验证性。

Conclusion: SIE框架为LLM推理训练提供了可扩展、可泛化且可验证的环境，展示了结构化数据在提升推理能力和泛化性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

*Han Yan,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个统一的机器遗忘框架，通过在表示空间和参数空间实施双重平滑性来提高鲁棒性并平衡遗忘指标，解决了现有方法中的灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，机器遗忘技术需要解决用户隐私、版权侵权和安全问题。现有最先进的遗忘方法存在灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡的问题，往往过度优化一个目标而牺牲其他目标，且容易受到重新学习和越狱攻击的利用。

Method: PRISM框架包含两个平滑优化阶段：(1) 表示空间阶段使用鲁棒训练的探针防御越狱攻击；(2) 参数空间阶段解耦保留-遗忘梯度冲突，减少不平衡，并平滑参数空间以减轻重新学习攻击。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRISM在对话和连续文本设置下，在多种攻击下优于最先进的基线方法，同时在关键指标之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: PRISM通过双重空间平滑性有效解决了机器遗忘中的鲁棒性和指标平衡问题，在对抗攻击的同时保持了模型的实用性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCritical是一个用于医学复杂推理任务的两阶段框架，通过小语言模型自我对抗学习来提升推理能力，无需依赖大模型的持续指导，在7B模型上实现了新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域复杂推理任务中，小语言模型表现不佳的问题，同时避免传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大模型作为评判者所带来的成本、时间和效率挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段从教师模型提取长链思维模板指导学生模型；第二阶段通过模型自我迭代协作的直接偏好优化，让学生模型与微调后的自身修正轨迹对抗学习。

Result: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准上分别超越Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型3.04%和10.12%，在7B级小模型中达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MedCritical通过模型自我学习的DPO方法，以较低成本实现了与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的效果，证明了自我对抗学习在提升小模型医学推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MetaAPO框架，通过元学习器动态评估在线采样的潜在收益，平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布，在减少42%在线标注成本的同时，在多个基准测试中优于现有偏好优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线偏好数据与演化模型策略之间的分布不匹配问题，现有方法使用静态启发式或解耦的在线采样策略，无法适应模型的动态学习状态。

Method: MetaAPO框架通过轻量级元学习器作为"对齐差距估计器"，评估在线采样相对于离线数据的潜在收益，指导有针对性的在线生成，并为优化目标分配样本级元权重。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2、Arena-Hard和MT-Bench上的实验表明，MetaAPO在各种设置下始终优于现有偏好优化方法，同时减少42%的在线标注成本。

Conclusion: MetaAPO通过动态耦合数据生成与模型训练，有效解决了偏好优化中的分布不匹配问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

TL;DR: 提出Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD)框架，通过双阶段对比机制在推理过程中优化token级logits，有效减少放射学多模态大语言模型中的医学幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学中生成临床无依据的描述（医学幻觉），这在需要准确性和图像基础输出的医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: CCD是一个无需训练和检索的推理框架，整合来自特定任务放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号，通过双阶段对比机制在生成过程中优化token级logits。

Result: 在三个数据集和多个模型上的实验表明，CCD持续提升放射学报告生成性能。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，应用于最先进的RRG模型时，RadGraph-F1指标提升高达17%。

Conclusion: CCD为减轻医学幻觉提供了一个轻量级且可泛化的解决方案，有效连接了放射学中的专家模型和多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Guard Vector是一种安全任务向量，通过组合目标语言模型产生目标保护模型，无需额外训练即可提升安全分类质量并支持多语言扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有保护模型在多语言支持和模型可移植性方面的限制，同时减少数据和计算需求。

Method: 使用保护向量作为参数差异，结合前缀训练和单令牌输出分类器，实现流式感知的安全保护。

Result: 在标准安全套件上提升分类质量，支持中文、日文和韩文扩展，并在Llama和Gemma模型上实现可移植性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过流式感知评估实践，在减少资源需求的同时促进了更负责任的AI生态系统。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出在单次训练运行中同时进行多个预训练实验的方法，以降低计算成本，并在1.5B参数模型上验证了可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练实验是理解大语言模型学习机制的重要工具，但计算成本高昂限制了实验规模。

Method: 在单个模型训练过程中并行进行10个实验，包括数据污染、投毒、记忆化等研究，并测试实验间的交互影响。

Result: 成功复现了多个先前工作的结果，并开展了知识获取、数学推理和水印等新研究，实验对模型训练动态影响极小。

Conclusion: 单次训练运行中进行多实验的方法能以有限计算预算实现大模型的严格科学实验。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法存在效率低、容易陷入局部最优的问题，需要更稳定高效的优化策略。

Method: 提出GRACE框架，包含门控优化策略（反馈调节门和更新拒绝门）和自适应压缩策略（提炼核心概念并重构优化轨迹）。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验显示，相比现有最优方法，在BIG-Bench Hard、领域特定和通用NLP任务上分别获得4.7%、4.4%和2.7%的平均相对性能提升，且仅需25%的提示生成预算。

Conclusion: GRACE通过策略性引入信息损失实现了高效稳定的提示优化，显著提升了性能表现和计算效率。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了机器翻译中的副文本显化任务，通过构建专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估LLM在文化术语翻译中的表现，发现LLM生成的副文本能提高理解但不如专业译者，并揭示了文化调解的开放性本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器翻译中文化绑定术语的忠实传递问题，现有方法只关注文本内解决方案，忽视了专业译者使用的脚注和尾注等副文本工具。

Method: 基于Genette的副文本理论，构建了560个专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估了带和不带推理轨迹的LLM在显化选择和内容上的表现，使用了内在提示和代理检索方法。

Result: 实验表明该任务具有挑战性，人类评估显示LLM生成的副文本能提高受众理解，但效果远不如译者创作的副文本。统计分析显示专业译者在副文本使用上差异很大。

Conclusion: 副文本显化有潜力推动机器翻译超越语言对等，可扩展到单语解释和个性化适应，文化调解本质上是开放性的而非规定性的。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，它们在自动评分中的应用日益广泛。由于LLMs具备强大的推理能力，能够提供评分理由，因此比较人类和LLM评分员的理由有助于理解各自的评分推理过程。

Method: 使用大规模测试的作文数据，基于二次加权kappa和归一化互信息评估GPT-4o、Gemini等LLMs的评分准确性，使用余弦相似度评估理由相似性，并通过主成分分析探索理由的聚类模式。

Result: 研究发现揭示了LLMs在自动评分中的准确性和"思考"过程，提供了对评分理由的深入理解。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解人类评分和基于LLM的自动评分背后的理由提供了重要见解，有助于改进自动评分系统的开发。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型编码了大量事实知识，但由于评估过于严格，许多正确答案被误判为错误，导致低估了模型的参数化知识。

Method: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，限制模型输出为唯一的表面形式，并使用YAGO-QA数据集(19,137个通用知识问题)进行评估。

Result: 标准解码低估了模型知识：Llama-3.1-70B在普通解码下F1为32.3%，使用RCD提升至46.0%；Llama-3.1-8B使用RCD达到33.0%，超过大模型在普通解码下的表现。

Conclusion: RCD方法能更准确地评估语言模型的知识能力，证明当前评估方法确实低估了模型的实际知识水平。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型系列上的广泛实验证实，CooT持续提升安全性和社交推理性能

Conclusion: CooT将LLM对齐转变为显式、动态、可审计的推理过程，无需重新训练模型即可灵活更新策略

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

Iqra'Eval 2025 Shared Task. We adapted Wav2Vec2-BERT via Two-Stage training
strategy. In the first stage, task-adaptive continue pretraining was performed
on large-scale Arabic speech-phonemes datasets, which were generated by
converting the Arabic text using the MSA Phonetiser. In the second stage, the
model was fine-tuned on the official shared task data, with additional
augmentation from XTTS-v2-synthesized recitations featuring varied Ayat
segments, speaker embeddings, and textual perturbations to simulate possible
human errors. The system ranked first on the official leaderboard,
demonstrating that phoneme-aware pretraining combined with targeted
augmentation yields strong performance in phoneme-level mispronunciation
detection.

### [67] [From Human Annotation to Automation: LLM-in-the-Loop Active Learning for Arabic Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23515)
*Dania Refai,Alaa Dalaq,Doaa Dalaq,Irfan Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于阿拉伯语情感分析的主动学习框架，通过LLM辅助标注显著减少标注成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语情感分析因缺乏大规模高质量标注数据集而进展有限，主动学习在其他语言中已证明能减少标注工作量，但在阿拉伯语中研究较少，LLM辅助标注的性能也尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用主动学习框架评估LSTM、GRU和RNN等深度学习架构，在三个基准数据集上比较人工标注和LLM辅助标注两种策略，评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等五种LLM作为标注器。

Result: LLM辅助的主动学习达到或优于人工标注性能，如在Hunger Station数据集上LSTM模型仅用450个GPT-4o生成的样本达到93%准确率，在MASAC数据集上DeepSeek Chat用650个样本达到82%准确率。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的主动学习是阿拉伯语情感分析中减少标注成本的有效方法，能够实现与人工标注相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了微调LLM作为评判员在实际部署中的三个关键问题：未来适应性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力，发现在数学领域中未来适应性最具挑战性，而向后兼容性相对容易实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微调评判员模型在评估和奖励建模中的广泛应用，现有标准评估忽略了实际部署中的关键问题，特别是评判员在面对未来模型、过去模型和未见问题时如何保持性能。

Method: 在数学领域建立统一框架，研究不同训练和测试分布下的性能表现，使用三种基于SFT和DPO的微调算法，并在三个不同基础模型上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明：未来适应性对大多数模型具有挑战性；向后兼容性相对容易，DPO训练模型持续提升性能；持续学习比仅训练强或弱响应更平衡；所有模型在未见问题上都出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前评判员模型无法完全泛化到未见问题，研究结果为在不断变化的生成器环境中开发和部署评判员模型提供了实践指导。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Abstract: Medical dictation systems are essential tools in modern healthcare, enabling
accurate and efficient conversion of speech into written medical documentation.
The main objective of this paper is to create a domain-specific system for
Greek medical speech transcriptions. The ultimate goal is to assist healthcare
professionals by reducing the overload of manual documentation and improving
workflow efficiency. Towards this goal, we develop a system that combines
automatic speech recognition techniques with text correction model, allowing
better handling of domain-specific terminology and linguistic variations in
Greek. Our approach leverages both acoustic and textual modeling to create more
realistic and reliable transcriptions. We focused on adapting existing language
and speech technologies to the Greek medical context, addressing challenges
such as complex medical terminology and linguistic inconsistencies. Through
domain-specific fine-tuning, our system achieves more accurate and coherent
transcriptions, contributing to the development of practical language
technologies for the Greek healthcare sector.

TL;DR: 提出MoRSD方法，通过选择高质量推理路径来改进CoT蒸馏，在更少数据下实现性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法低估了推理路径质量的重要性，主要关注数据量，可能将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型

Method: 提出模型导向的推理路径选择蒸馏(MoRSD)，包括推理路径难度(RD)指标来评估学生模型在给定推理路径下生成正确答案的能力，基于准确性、多样性和难度选择高质量推理路径

Result: 在三个任务的七个数据集上平均提升4.6%，使用更少但更高质量的推理路径

Conclusion: 少量高质量推理路径比整个数据集更能提升学生模型的推理能力，MoRSD为高效CoT蒸馏提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

*Kevin Frank,Anmol Gulati,Elias Lumer,Sindy Campagna,Vamse Kumar Subbiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jackal是一个新颖的大规模文本到JQL基准测试，包含10万对自然语言请求与已验证的JQL查询，在拥有20万多个问题的实时Jira实例上执行。该基准测试评估了23个大语言模型在生成正确且可执行JQL查询方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏开放、真实世界、基于执行的文本到JQL映射基准测试。企业团队依赖JQL从Jira检索和过滤问题，但现有解决方案不足以评估模型在实际环境中的表现。

Method: 创建了包含10万对自然语言请求与JQL查询的Jackal基准测试，每对查询关联四种用户请求类型：长自然语言、短自然语言、语义相似和语义精确。在实时Jira实例上执行验证，并开发了基于执行的评分工具包。

Result: 在Jackal-5K子集上，最佳模型(Gemini 2.5 Pro)在四种用户请求类型上的平均执行准确率仅为60.3%。性能在不同请求类型间差异显著：长自然语言(86.0%)、短自然语言(35.7%)、语义相似(22.7%)、语义精确(99.3%)。

Conclusion: Jackal基准测试揭示了当前最先进大语言模型在生成正确JQL查询方面的局限性，为Jira企业数据的未来研究设定了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐藏层时域信号频域分析的幻觉检测方法HSAD，通过将LLM推理过程建模为认知旅程，利用傅里叶变换提取频域特征来捕捉推理过程中的异常，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖范围和推理偏差检测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在关键应用场景中频繁出现的幻觉问题阻碍了其部署，现有检测方法受限于知识覆盖范围或难以捕捉推理过程中的偏差，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 将LLM推理过程建模为认知旅程，通过隐藏层时域信号模拟人类在欺骗检测场景中的信号感知和辨别过程，应用快速傅里叶变换将时域信号映射到频域构建频谱特征，基于这些特征设计幻觉检测算法。

Result: HSAD方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面表现出色，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖和推理偏差检测方面的限制。

Conclusion: 通过有效结合推理过程建模和频域特征提取，HSAD方法为LLM幻觉检测提供了一种更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: Timber是一种无需训练的方法，通过部分将Instruct模型恢复回Base模型来增强其探索能力，同时保持利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练被认为很表面化，虽然提高了利用能力但限制了探索能力，需要解决这种权衡问题。

Method: 通过细微但有针对性的权重增量调整，部分将Instruct模型恢复回配对的Base模型。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的实验表明，Timber能持续改进普通Instruct模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 从权重层面为后训练阶段提供了新见解，并提供了无需训练即可改进Instruct模型的实用策略。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Latent Codebooks for Fast Thinking的框架，通过训练时使用简洁的思维链草图学习离散策略先验的码本，在推理时使用少量从码本中提取的连续思维向量进行策略级指导，无需生成显式推理标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前面向推理的大语言模型依赖逐步生成显式标记，通常需要大规模监督微调或强化学习。思维链技术虽然显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能，但效率低下，需要长推理轨迹，增加了延迟和标记使用量。

Method: 1. 使用简洁的CoT草图训练学习离散策略先验的码本；2. 推理时基于从码本中提取的连续思维向量进行单次推理；3. 提出GainRouter轻量级路由机制，自适应切换快速码本引导推理和慢速显式推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，该方法实现了竞争性或更优的准确性，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型中的高效可控推理提供了一条实用路径，能够抑制过度思考并减少不必要的标记生成。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的扩散语言模型难以修正错误的标记，一旦生成就会固定不变。关键挑战在于识别输入中的潜在错误。

Method: RemeDi联合预测标记分布和每个标记的置信度分数，根据置信度决定哪些标记需要重掩码。设计了包含监督微调和强化学习的重掩码感知训练流程。

Result: 实验表明，RemeDi在多个数据集上达到了开源扩散语言模型的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 重掩码机制显著提升了扩散语言模型在文本生成中的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

Motivation: 虽然强化学习在提升复杂推理能力方面表现出色，但其在跨语言泛化方面与监督微调的比较尚未被探索，需要系统研究这两种方法在多语言推理任务上的表现差异。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-3B-Base作为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准测试（数学推理、常识推理、科学推理）上进行实验，比较RL和SFT的性能，并进行机制分析。

Result: RL在准确率和跨语言泛化能力上都显著优于SFT；在非英语数据上训练的RL比在英语数据上训练效果更好，而SFT无此现象；机制分析显示RL赋予模型更鲁棒的推理策略。

Conclusion: RL能够为模型提供更鲁棒的推理策略，为实现更公平有效的多语言推理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现、可扩展，能与现有LLM训练和部署流程无缝集成，为行业提供更稳健和公平的多语言AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment

TL;DR: TF-Bench是一个基于System F类型推断的基准测试，用于评估LLM的程序语义推理能力，通过去除语义无关的自然语言构建纯语义版本TF-Bench_pure，发现当前最先进的LLM在该任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理基准缺乏形式化的程序中心演绎框架，无法评估模型是否真正理解程序语义还是仅利用自然语言和代码标记之间的表面关联。

Method: 引入TF-Bench基准，基于System F类型推断评估LLM推理能力，通过验证转换去除语义无关的自然语言构建TF-Bench_pure变体，并提出两个新指标评估鲁棒性和测试时推理效果。

Result: 最先进的LLM（Claude-3.7-sonnet）在TF-Bench_pure上仅达到55.85%的准确率，显示出当前LLM能力的显著局限性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在程序语义推理方面存在关键限制，为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied

TL;DR: 提出M-Hyper方法解决多模态知识图谱补全问题，通过四元数代数实现融合模态和独立模态的共存协作，克服现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法存在两种范式：融合方法会丢失模态特定信息且缺乏灵活性，集成方法难以捕捉模态间的语义交互。需要克服这两种局限。

Method: 使用四元数代数，四个正交基表示独立模态，Hamilton积建模模态间交互。包含细粒度实体表示分解模块和鲁棒关系感知模态融合模块。

Result: 实验表明该方法达到最先进性能，具有鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: M-Hyper成功实现了融合和独立模态表示的共存协作，在多模态知识图谱补全任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态推理方面存在整合瓶颈，研究发现额外模态仅在提供独立充分推理路径时提升性能，而冗余或链式推理支持往往损害性能。主要存在任务组合瓶颈和融合瓶颈两个核心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在跨模态推理方面的不一致表现，缺乏受控评估框架和内部机制分析的问题，探究模态交互何时以及为何支持或削弱推理能力。

Method: 采用基于逻辑的评估框架，将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，分析事实在不同模态间的分布和逻辑组合方式。通过注意力模式分析和两步提示法（先识别后推理）验证假设。

Result: 额外模态仅在提供独立充分推理路径时提升性能；推理性能以三种系统方式退化：较弱模态拖累整体性能、冲突导致模态偏好、不同模态信号无法有效整合。两步提示法能恢复性能，软化早期融合注意力可改善推理。

Conclusion: 整合而非感知是多模态推理的主要障碍，建议采用组合感知训练和早期融合控制作为有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

Motivation: 语音集成到LLMs虽然扩展了其能力，但往往以削弱其核心文本能力为代价，限制了模型充分利用预训练文本知识的能力。

Method: 提出了基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，研究了编码器-适配器范式，并测试了分层学习率调度和低秩适应(LoRA)两种缓解策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，两种方法都比完全微调更好地保持了文本能力，同时提高了下游口语问答性能。

Conclusion: 分析为所提出的缓解策略有效性提供了原则性解释，将其优势与LLMs中文本知识的结构特性联系起来。

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有RLHF框架主要依赖偏好奖励，但忽视了模型内部知识边界，加剧了'幻觉税'问题，需要解决长文本生成中的事实性缺陷

Method: 利用预训练知识边界构建事实检查表指导在线强化学习，同时训练基于基础模型内部知识的自评估模块，采用双事实对齐机制联合优化事实召回和精确度

Result: KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著提升了事实性指标，有效缓解了模型幻觉问题

Conclusion: KLCF框架通过知识一致性强化学习有效解决了LLM长文本生成中的幻觉问题，无需外部知识且轻量级，具有良好的可扩展性

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM个性化中的两个关键挑战：冷启动问题（用户历史数据不足）和偏见问题（用户历史数据丰富但偏斜），两者都源于无法建模用户间的集体知识

Method: 提出本地-全局记忆框架(LoGo)，结合个性化本地记忆和捕捉群体共享兴趣的集体全局记忆，并引入调解模块来解决本地和全局信号之间的冲突

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LoGo一致提高了个性化质量，既能预热冷启动用户，又能减轻有偏预测

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了纳入集体知识对于增强LLM个性化的重要性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多选题中经常出错，尽管在其他情境下能展示正确知识。这种知识-预测差距需要被理解和解决。

Method: 通过探测分析发现残差流中存在知识基和预测基两个重要基向量，提出KAPPA方法——基于投影调整的无参数干预，将隐藏状态变换以对齐预测坐标与知识坐标。

Result: 在Big-Bench-Hard和ARC-Challenge的二选题重构实验中，KAPPA显著提升准确率并持续优于基线方法。该方法还能扩展到非多选题场景。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对知识-预测差距的新几何理解，并提出了实用的方法来更好地对齐模型行为与其潜在知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Conclusion: Open-DeBias在广泛的NLP任务中表现出鲁棒性、多语言优势和适用于通用开放域偏见缓解的适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

Conclusion: SPELL展示了在无需大规模标注数据的情况下提升长文本推理能力的潜力，为扩展到更强大模型提供了前景。

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

TL;DR: 提出Q-Tuning框架，通过联合优化样本级和token级修剪，在仅使用12.5%训练数据的情况下，在SmolLM2-1.7B上实现比全数据SFT基线平均提升38%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着监督微调(SFT)计算成本增加，数据效率变得至关重要。现有数据修剪方法存在设计碎片化问题，无法同时优化样本和token两个维度，导致显著的低效率。

Method: 提出错误-不确定性(EU)平面诊断框架，联合表征训练数据在样本和token维度的异质效用。采用两阶段策略：先进行样本级筛选保留富含信息性误解或校准信号的样本；然后应用非对称token修剪策略，仅从误解样本中修剪不显著token，完整保留校准样本。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中达到新的最优水平。在SmolLM2-1.7B上，仅使用12.5%原始训练数据就实现了比全数据SFT基线平均38%的性能提升。

Conclusion: Q-Tuning是首个能持续超越全数据训练的动态修剪方法，为预算受限的LLM SFT提供了实用且可扩展的数据利用最大化蓝图。

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

Motivation: 当前基于多向量范式的视觉文档检索方法虽然有效，但存储开销巨大，每个文档需要存储数百个向量，在大规模部署时成本高昂且不实用。

Method: DocPruner利用文档内patch注意力分布来动态识别和丢弃冗余嵌入，实现自适应patch级嵌入剪枝。

Conclusion: DocPruner为构建存储高效的大规模视觉文档检索系统提供了一个鲁棒、灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

Conclusion: EOSER、ASS机制和CJ-GRPO算法为掩码扩散语言模型的解码和强化学习训练提供了有前景的解决方案，实现了更少的解码步骤和竞争性性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

### [93] [Assessing Large Language Models in Updating Their Forecasts with New Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23936)
*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST框架评估LLMs在新信息出现时是否能适当修正预测，发现LLMs的预测更新不一致且过于保守，置信度校准远低于人类标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未考虑随着新证据出现，预测及其置信度应如何演变。

Method: 引入EVOLVECAST框架，评估LLMs在训练截止后发布的新信息面前是否适当修正预测，以人类预测者作为比较基准分析预测变化和置信度校准。

Result: LLMs对新信息有一定响应性，但更新往往不一致或过于保守；口头和基于logits的置信度估计均未明显优于对方，且都远低于人类标准；模型普遍表现出保守偏差。

Conclusion: 需要更稳健的信念更新方法来解决LLMs在动态预测环境中的局限性。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Easy Turn，一个开源的模块化轮次检测模型，集成声学和语言双模态信息来预测四种对话轮次状态，并发布了1145小时的训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对于自然人机通信至关重要，但现有解决方案要么依赖未开源的专用轮次检测模型，要么参数规模过大或仅支持单模态，要么需要大量难以获取的全双工数据。

Method: 开发了开源的模块化轮次检测模型Easy Turn，集成声学和语言双模态信息，预测四种对话轮次状态（完成、未完成、反馈、等待），并构建了1145小时的Easy Turn trainset训练数据集。

Result: 与现有的开源模型（如TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2）相比，Easy Turn在开源测试集上实现了最先进的轮次检测准确率。

Conclusion: Easy Turn解决了现有轮次检测模型的局限性，提供了开源的双模态解决方案，数据和模型将在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉基础口译(VGI)方法，通过整合视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头输入，利用视觉上下文信息提升机器口译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器口译系统仅依赖单一语言模态，在需要视觉、情境或语用信息进行消歧的语境中表现受限。

Method: 开发原型系统，集成视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，构建手工诊断语料库评估三种歧义类型。

Result: 视觉基础显著改善词汇消歧，在性别消解上获得适度但不稳定的提升，对句法歧义无改善效果。

Conclusion: 采用多模态方法是提升机器口译翻译质量的必要步骤。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

TL;DR: HiPO框架通过混合策略优化实现自适应推理控制，让LLM选择性使用详细推理或直接回答，在保持准确性的同时显著减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂任务中依赖链式推理(CoT)，但总是生成冗长推理轨迹效率低下，导致token使用过多和推理成本过高。

Method: HiPO结合混合数据管道（提供成对的详细推理和直接回答响应）与混合强化学习奖励系统，平衡准确性和效率，避免对详细推理的过度依赖。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，HiPO能够显著减少token长度，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: HiPO为高效自适应推理提供了原则性方法，推动了推理导向LLM在资源敏感的实际场景中的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ByteSized32Refactored，一个重构、模块化且可扩展的文本游戏生成实现，通过创建GameBasic.py基础库和抽象7个基类，将代码量从2万行减少到1万行，提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟交互式世界模型是大型语言模型的核心挑战，需要构建可扩展的文本游戏生成环境来支持新场景和规范的集成。

Method: 重构ByteSized32代码结构，创建GameBasic.py基础库，抽象出7个基类（如GameObject等）作为可复用模块，采用集中化设计减少代码重复。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行实验显示，重构后的系统在未见场景的文本游戏生成中，在四个评估维度中的两个维度上质量有所提升，但在另外两个维度上有所下降，表明重构的层次结构为LLM带来了新挑战。

Conclusion: 基于基础库和模块化优化的可扩展代码结构不仅促进了LLM对环境规范的适应，还建立了一个支持未来扩展的可扩展环境。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

TL;DR: PaLRS是一种无需训练的大语言模型偏好对齐方法，通过提取残差流中的偏好信号来创建轻量级转向向量，可在推理时应用以引导模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法如RLHF或DPO需要精心策划的数据和昂贵的参数优化，导致任务特定的模型且效率低下。

Method: 从少量偏好对中提取残差流中的偏好信号，创建轻量级、即插即用的转向向量，在推理时应用以引导模型行为。

Result: 在中小型开源LLM上评估显示，PaLRS在数学推理和代码生成任务上获得一致提升，同时保持基准通用性能，相比DPO方法性能更好且节省大量时间。

Conclusion: PaLRS为偏好对齐提供了一种更高效、灵活的无训练替代方案，只需最少数据即可实现即插即用的对齐机制。

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了完整模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在机器翻译任务中的性能与效率权衡，发现模型压缩策略能显著降低计算需求和环境影响，同时保持有竞争力的翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速扩展，其计算和环境成本问题日益突出，需要研究如何在保持性能的同时提高效率。

Method: 使用Flores+基准测试和人工评估，比较完整3.3B fp32模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在法语、印地语和卡纳达语翻译任务中的表现，并分析碳排放。

Result: 完整3.3B模型BLEU得分最高但碳排放最大（约0.007-0.008 kg CO2/次），蒸馏模型推理速度快4.5倍且BLEU下降很小，即使激进量化（INT4）也能保持高准确性和流畅度。

Conclusion: 模型压缩策略能显著降低计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争性翻译质量，但在低资源环境下权衡更明显，建议将效率和可持续性纳入NLP评估框架。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理在工业中部署增多，需要保护它们免受风险，解决策略到实践的差距问题。

Method: 引入'策略即提示'方法，使用LLM解释自然语言策略，构建可验证策略树，编译为轻量级提示分类器，在运行时审计代理行为。

Result: 在多样化应用中验证了该方法的有效性，展示了可扩展和可审计的管道。

Conclusion: 该框架为可验证更安全、更可监管的AI铺平了道路，弥合了关键的政策到实践差距。

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

TL;DR: 提出了MCPMark基准测试，用于更真实全面地评估MCP在复杂工作流中的使用情况，包含127个高质量任务，要求丰富的CRUD操作交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试范围狭窄，主要关注读取密集型任务或交互深度有限的任务，无法捕捉真实世界工作流的复杂性和现实性。

Method: 构建包含127个高质量任务的基准测试，每个任务都有精心设计的初始状态和自动验证脚本，要求多样化的CRUD操作交互。使用最小化代理框架在工具调用循环中进行评估。

Result: 最佳模型gpt-5-medium仅达到52.56% pass@1和33.86% pass^4，其他强模型表现更差。平均每个任务需要16.2个执行轮次和17.4个工具调用，远超之前的基准测试。

Conclusion: MCPMark是一个压力测试性质的基准测试，凸显了当前LLM在处理复杂现实工作流时的挑战，现有模型在复杂MCP任务上仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM)，通过Next Sequence Prediction (NSP)统一了next-token和next-block预测，能够自适应确定每个步骤的生成长度，同时保持KV缓存兼容性，显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)具有理论效率优势，但受到固定长度解码和与KV缓存不兼容的限制。虽然块扩散缓解了这些问题，但仍需固定块大小和昂贵的训练成本。

Method: 基于NSP提出SDLM，可以在固定大小的掩码块内进行扩散推理，但根据模型置信度动态解码连续子序列。该方法能够以最小成本改造预训练的自回归语言模型。

Result: 实验显示SDLM仅使用350万训练样本就能匹配或超越强自回归基线，同时比Qwen-2.5实现2.1倍吞吐量。SDLM-32B模型展现出更显著的效率提升，证明了该建模范式的强可扩展性。

Conclusion: SDLM成功统一了扩散和自回归建模，在保持KV缓存兼容性的同时显著提升了推理效率，展示了扩散语言模型在实际应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SparseD方法，通过预计算头部特定稀疏模式并在去噪步骤中复用，结合早期使用全注意力、后期切换为稀疏注意力的策略，实现扩散语言模型的无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源扩散语言模型推理延迟高，主要由于注意力机制在长上下文中的二次复杂度。虽然稀疏注意力在自回归模型中已有应用，但扩散模型中的注意力模式具有头部特异性、跨步骤相似性等特点，使得传统稀疏方法不适用。

Method: SparseD方法：1) 预计算头部特定的稀疏模式并跨步骤复用；2) 早期去噪步骤使用全注意力保证生成质量，后期切换为稀疏注意力；3) 利用扩散模型中注意力模式的稳定性特点。

Result: 在64k上下文长度和1024去噪步骤下，SparseD相比FlashAttention实现了1.50倍的加速，且保持无损生成质量。

Conclusion: SparseD为扩散语言模型在长上下文应用中的部署提供了实用高效的解决方案，通过利用扩散模型特有的注意力特性实现了显著加速。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

TL;DR: 提出ResFormer，一种结合储层计算和Transformer的级联架构，用于高效处理不同长度的上下文，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时提升序列分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在序列分类任务中虽然性能优异，但存在二次时间/内存复杂度的限制，难以处理长上下文输入。现有方法在降低计算需求方面仍有挑战。

Method: 采用级联方法：使用带非线性读出的储层计算网络捕获长期上下文依赖（线性时间），同时使用传统Transformer处理固定长度的短期句子依赖。

Result: 在EmoryNLP数据集上比DeepSeek-Qwen和ModernBERT基线模型准确率提升高达+22.3%，在MultiWOZ、MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上也有持续提升，且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: ResFormer在建模广泛上下文信息方面展现出高效性和有效性，解决了Transformer在长序列处理中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体和互联网的发展，情感分析在营销、政治和客户服务等领域的重要性日益增长，但在外语应用中存在缺陷，特别是缺乏标注数据来训练模型。

Method: 使用多语言数据集，采用预训练情感分析模型集成方法：bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment和XLM-R，对句子进行情感评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用所提出的方法，情感分析性能达到86%以上。

Conclusion: 提出的transformer集成模型和LLM方法在多语言情感分析中表现良好，特别是在缺乏标注数据的情况下能够有效工作。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEAR是一个用于评估大语言模型溯因推理能力的自动化评估框架，通过一致性、泛化性和多样性三个指标来评分，无需人工标注答案，能够揭示模型在生成新知识方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大语言模型的指令遵循和演绎推理能力，但对其能否发现新知识以及如何评估这种能力的研究不足。本文旨在通过研究溯因推理（生成合理解释观察的假设）来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出GEAR评估范式，包含三个评分指标：一致性（假设解释观察）、泛化性（假设对未见输入的预测能力）、多样性（假设集的覆盖范围）。使用该框架对9个LLM在4个溯因基准上进行细粒度研究，生成超过50,000个候选假设。还提出了基于动量的课程学习策略，根据学习速度调整训练数据。

Result: GEAR能够可靠地评估LLM的溯因推理能力，揭示出被传统黄金答案或纯人工评估所掩盖的模型差异。基于动量的课程学习策略在没有黄金标签监督的情况下，改善了所有GEAR目标，并且这些改进能够迁移到已有的溯因推理基准上。

Conclusion: GEAR提供了一个原则性的框架，既能评估溯因推理能力，又能提供无需标签、可扩展的训练信号，帮助LLM生成更多样化和可靠的假设。

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析模型存在固有的社会偏见，在现实应用中可能造成危害。传统方法构建多样化测试句子需要领域专家和众包，成本高昂。

Method: 使用大型语言模型进行可控的测试句子生成，通过最小化规范要求生成高质量测试用例。

Result: 实验表明该方法能提供高语言变异性和多样性的测试句子，对未见过的偏见也能提供更好的测试覆盖。

Conclusion: BTC-SAM框架能有效生成高质量测试用例，为情感分析模型的偏见检测提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

TL;DR: 提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，通过上下文信息连接道德基础与道德推理目标，显著提升大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在道德推理中面临泛化挑战，因为模型擅长捕捉分布语义，而道德推理在语用层面运作，两者存在根本差异。

Method: 基于道德基础理论提出语用推理方法，利用每一步的上下文信息来弥合语用鸿沟，指导LLMs将道德基础与道德推理目标相连接。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著增强了大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为未来基于道德基础理论的研究提供了基础，证明语用推理方法能有效提升LLMs的道德推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global

signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Abstract: As digital platforms redefine educational paradigms, ensuring interactivity
remains vital for effective learning. This paper explores using Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically respond to student questions
from online lectures - a novel question answering task of real world
significance. We introduce the EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 question-answer pairs
(both synthetic and real-world) from 296 computer science videos covering

Our benchmarking experiments consist of 6 state-of-the-art MLLMs, through which
we study the effectiveness of our synthetic data for finetuning, as well as
showing the challenging nature of the task. We evaluate the models using both
text-based and qualitative metrics, thus showing a nuanced perspective of the
models' performance, which is paramount to future work. This work not only sets

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注点准确率，但忽视了改写不变性和搜索稳定性，导致提示词对语义保持的微小改写非常敏感，性能波动大。

Method: 提出了TARE框架：内层基于采样的对抗搜索，用困难改写测试提示词；外层鲁棒选择，偏好邻域内性能稳定的候选。还提出了ATARE，学习各向异性权重来塑造语义邻域并自适应调整半径。

Result: 在多样化任务上评估，TARE方法在保持改写下准确率的同时优于仅关注准确率的提示搜索方法，且计算效率实用。

Conclusion: 通过最小化文本锐度差距，TARE框架能够生成在语义改写下保持准确率的鲁棒提示词，解决了现有方法的脆弱性问题。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

TL;DR: 提出LLM提出的开放分类法(LOT)，通过生成式语言模型比较两个大型推理模型的推理轨迹，用文字描述它们的差异特征，并基于经验分布预测推理轨迹的来源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型比较主要关注宏观统计指标如任务准确率或推理长度，不同模型是否以不同方式推理仍是一个未解问题。

Method: 使用生成式语言模型比较两个LRM的推理轨迹，描述其差异特征，然后基于这些特征在LRM输出中的经验分布预测推理轨迹的来源模型。通过迭代处理推理轨迹数据集，生成人类可读的分类法。

Result: 在数学、科学和编程任务上比较12个开源LRM，LOT识别出它们思维的系统性差异，在区分不同规模、基础模型家族或目标领域的LRM时达到80-100%的准确率。案例研究中，将较小Qwen3模型的推理风格与最大Qwen3对齐，使GPQA准确率提高3.3-5.7%。

Conclusion: LOT提供了一种量化比较LRM推理差异的方法，其自然语言分类法能够定性解释模型如何不同地思考，并且推理风格的差异与性能相关。

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于任务子空间对数归因(TSLA)的新框架，用于识别专门负责任务识别(TR)和任务学习(TL)的注意力头，揭示了它们在上下文学习中的不同但互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和关于大语言模型中上下文学习机制的两个主要观点：注意力头的组件级分析和ICL整体分解为任务识别与任务学习，以提供统一且可解释的机制解释。

Method: 使用TSLA框架识别TR和TL专用注意力头，通过相关性分析、消融研究、输入扰动以及隐藏状态的几何分析进行验证。

Result: 发现TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，而TL头在子空间内旋转隐藏状态朝向正确标签以促进预测，两者独立且有效地捕获ICL的TR和TL组件。

Conclusion: 该框架为大语言模型在不同任务和设置中执行上下文学习提供了统一且可解释的解释，并能调和先前关于ICL机制的研究发现。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

TL;DR: 提出了学习任务向量(LTVs)方法，直接训练任务向量而非从模型输出中提取，在准确性和灵活性上优于传统方法，并通过系统分析揭示了任务向量在Transformer中的工作机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常从模型输出或隐藏状态中提取任务向量，方法繁琐且不透明，很少阐明任务向量如何影响计算机制。

Method: 直接训练学习任务向量(LTVs)，使其能在任意层、位置甚至ICL提示中有效工作；通过系统分析研究任务向量的机制作用。

Result: LTVs在准确性上超越提取的任务向量，具有更好的灵活性；发现任务向量主要通过注意力头OV电路引导预测，少量"关键头"起决定性作用；任务向量传播基本是线性的，早期任务向量被旋转到任务相关子空间，后期任务向量主要进行幅度缩放。

Conclusion: LTVs不仅提供了获取有效任务向量的实用方法，还为理解ICL的机制基础提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在真实应用中受限于训练数据稀缺和任务复杂性，特别是需要处理罕见、未见场景的长尾知识问题。

Method: 首先通过监督微调进行预热，然后通过自引导拒绝采样微调进一步优化。采用检索增强生成技术，在推理时利用网络教程作为外部知识源。

Result: 在三个不同任务上的评估显示，RAG-GUI始终优于基线代理，在两个模型尺寸上比其他推理基线提升2.6%到13.3%。

Conclusion: RAG-GUI展示了强大的泛化能力和实用的即插即用能力，能够有效提升VLM基代理在真实世界场景中的表现。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗高风险应用中的使用增加，传统准确率指标无法捕捉问题特征和提供主题特定洞察，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)，为每个主题构建单维双参数逻辑IRT模型，收集80个不同LLMs在1,100个USMLE对齐问题上的响应，联合估计模型潜在能力、问题难度和区分度。

Result: 发现LLMs具有独特的"尖峰"能力分布，整体排名可能产生误导；GPT-5在多数领域表现最佳，但在社会科学和沟通领域被Claude-3-opus超越；IRT还能识别有缺陷的问题。

Conclusion: 建立了基于心理测量学的稳健评估方法，为LLMs在医疗保健中的安全有效部署提供了决策支持框架。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用LLM直接生成偏好列表的方法虽然对短期预测有效，但限制了个性化，决策过程不透明，且加剧了流行度偏差。需要更透明、可解释的用户偏好建模方法。

Method: PET框架通过应用logit-probing和生成式分类技术，将用户偏好建模为在稳定可解释偏好簇格上的动态概率分布，实现透明的偏好学习。

Result: 在公开基准测试(Yelp, MovieLens)上，PET比直接生成基线在NDCG指标上提升高达40%。在短视频平台大规模真实数据集上，在长尾内容排序方面表现优异，NDCG得分比SOTA生产模型高出7倍。

Conclusion: PET将用户画像模型从直接偏好列表生成转变为透明分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLM在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，主要由于无效的多跳检索和有限的推理能力。

Method: 采用合作自玩框架，训练单一LLM交替扮演分解者（分解复杂查询）和求解者（整合检索上下文生成答案），结合监督微调和强化学习微调。

Result: 在10个数据集上的三个推理密集型任务中，AceSearcher平均精确匹配率提升7.6%，32B版本仅用DeepSeek-V3不到5%的参数达到同等性能，小规模版本（1.5B和8B）也优于参数多9倍的现有模型。

Conclusion: AceSearcher在复杂推理任务中展现出卓越的效率和有效性，无需中间标注即可实现高性能推理。

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

### [120] [Can Large Language Models Express Uncertainty Like Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24202)
*Linwei Tao,Yi-Fan Yeh,Bo Kai,Minjing Dong,Tao Huang,Tom A. Lamb,Jialin Yu,Philip H. S. Torr,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出语言置信度(LC)作为大语言模型不确定性估计的轻量级方法，通过构建首个大规模对冲表达数据集和轻量级映射器，系统研究了现代LLM的语言置信度表现，并提出了改进框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有置信度估计方法存在局限性：logits通常不可访问，多采样计算成本高，数值化不确定性表达不符合自然交流习惯。需要一种轻量级、人类中心化的替代方案。

Method: 1) 发布首个大规模对冲表达数据集；2) 提出轻量级映射器将对冲表达转换为置信度分数；3) 系统研究现代LLM的语言置信度表现；4) 引入微调框架提升LC可靠性。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLM在表达可靠语言置信度方面表现不佳，但精心设计的提示方法能达到竞争性的校准和区分能力，微调框架可进一步改进LC可靠性。

Conclusion: 语言置信度是大语言模型不确定性估计的可扩展、高效且人类对齐的方法，值得深入探索。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

*Gaurav Srivastava,Aafiya Hussain,Zhenyu Bi,Swastik Roy,Priya Pitre,Meng Lu,Morteza Ziyadi,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeyondBench是一个避免训练数据污染的语言模型评估框架，通过算法问题生成创建数学基础问题，评估模型在44个算法任务上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基准测试因训练数据污染而无法准确评估语言模型真实推理能力的问题。

Method: 使用算法问题生成方法，创建三个难度级别的任务套件（Easy、Medium、Hard），涵盖从基础算术到NP完全问题的117种变体，每个任务从超过10^15个独特实例的组合空间中生成问题。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型，发现所有模型家族都存在一致的推理缺陷，随着问题复杂度从多项式增加到指数级，性能急剧下降。在Hard套件中，Gemini-2.5-pro、Llama-3.3-70B和Qwen2.5-72B的平均准确率分别为56.38%、26.91%和33.60%。

Conclusion: BeyondBench提供了一个无污染的评估框架，揭示了语言模型在复杂推理任务上的显著局限性，特别是在不使用工具的情况下性能大幅下降。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

### [122] [ScenarioBench: Trace-Grounded Compliance Evaluation for Text-to-SQL and RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24212)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench是一个基于政策、追踪感知的基准测试，用于在合规场景下评估Text-to-SQL和检索增强生成。它通过YAML场景包含黄金标准包、见证追踪、治理条款集和标准SQL，实现端到端评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL或KILT/RAG基准测试缺乏将决策与条款级证据严格关联的能力，需要开发一个能够评估系统决策理由质量的基准。

Method: 每个YAML场景包含无偷看黄金标准包、最小见证追踪、治理条款集和标准SQL。系统必须使用相同政策规范中的条款ID来证明输出，使解释可证伪且可审计。

Result: 评估器报告决策准确性、追踪质量、检索效果、SQL正确性、政策覆盖率、延迟和解释幻觉率。使用标准化场景难度指数(SDI)和预算变体(SDI-R)聚合结果。

Conclusion: 与现有基准相比，ScenarioBench在严格基础和禁止偷看规则下将每个决策与条款级证据关联，在明确时间预算下将收益转向证明质量。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员在分析语言中嵌入的人类道德和价值观时面临理论框架多样性和数据可用性的挑战，需要通用化的分类工具。

Method: 开发了MoVa套件，包括标注数据集、LLM提示策略（特别是all@once分类策略，类似于多标签分类器链）和评估工具。

Conclusion: MoVa的数据和方法可以促进对人类和机器通信的细粒度解释，对机器行为对齐具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Conclusion: 通过多LoRA适配器集成和vLLM实现的多LoRA推理方法，在游戏对话AI任务中取得了优异表现，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness
and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of
the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

TL;DR: MetaTuner是一个联合集成提示优化和微调的新型LLM训练框架，通过共享编码层实现知识共享，在多样化基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立地研究提示优化和微调这两种提升LLM性能的方法，未能充分探索它们的协同潜力。

Method: 引入两个神经网络分别生成提示和参数，共享底层编码层实现知识共享，设计监督正则化损失来有效训练框架。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MetaTuner框架成功展示了提示优化和微调的协同作用，为LLM训练提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态检索增强生成系统的评估未能系统考虑查询难度和模糊性，导致对系统真实性能的评估不全面。

Method: 提出MRAG-Suite评估平台，整合多个多模态基准数据集，引入基于难度的过滤策略和模糊感知策略，以及MM-RAGChecker诊断工具进行声明级分析。

Result: 结果显示在困难和模糊查询下，系统准确率显著降低，存在普遍的幻觉问题。MM-RAGChecker能有效诊断这些问题。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了考虑查询难度和模糊性的重要性，为改进多模态检索增强生成系统提供了指导方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Visual RAG) significantly advances
question answering by integrating visual and textual evidence. Yet, current
evaluations fail to systematically account for query difficulty and ambiguity.
We propose MRAG-Suite, a diagnostic evaluation platform integrating diverse

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimuHome是一个基于Matter协议的智能家居模拟器，用于测试LLM代理在复杂智能家居任务中的表现。研究发现现有模型在潜在意图推断、状态验证和时间调度方面表现不佳，即使最佳模型成功率也只有54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发智能家居代理面临缺乏真实模拟环境和评估基准的瓶颈。智能家居场景需要处理潜在用户意图、时间依赖、设备约束和调度等复杂挑战。

Method: 构建了基于Matter协议的SimuHome模拟器，支持时间加速和设备API调用，提供了包含600个场景的基准测试，评估了11个代理在统一ReAct框架下的表现。

Result: 模型在简单任务上表现良好，但在潜在意图推断、状态验证和时间调度方面存在困难。最佳模型GPT-4.1的成功率仅为54%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够通过工具可靠验证当前状态并协调时间相关动作的方法，以提升智能家居代理的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIRCSE是一个基于生成式迭代优化的句子嵌入框架，通过自回归生成软标记序列来改进语义表示，在MTEB基准测试中超越了现有LLM嵌入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的嵌入方法通常采用编码器范式，将LLM视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其核心的生成能力。

Method: 提出GIRCSE框架，利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示，通过产生在对比目标下优化的软标记序列来捕获潜在概念和隐式语义，并设计了迭代对比优化目标。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试和指令跟随任务中超越了强大的LLM嵌入基线，并且展现出测试时扩展特性：推理时生成更多标记能持续提升嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 生成式迭代优化为表示学习建立了新范式。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扎根理论虽然能从定性数据中提供深刻见解，但依赖专家手动编码存在可扩展性瓶颈，现有计算工具无法实现真正自动化。

Method: 集成LLM驱动编码、语义聚类、图推理和创新的迭代精炼过程，构建高度可重用的代码本，并引入5维指标和训练-测试分割协议进行标准化评估。

Result: 在五个不同语料库中始终优于强基线，在复杂数据集上与专家开发模式的匹配度达到88.2%。

Conclusion: LOGOS展示了一条在不牺牲理论细微差别的前提下，实现定性研究民主化和规模化的强大新路径。

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)由于其迭代和并行生成机制，存在与自回归LLMs不同的安全漏洞，需要专门的安全防护方案。

Method: 提出DiffuGuard训练免费防御框架，包含随机退火重掩码(SAR)来缓解贪婪选择偏差，以及块级审计修复(BAR)利用内部模型表示进行风险检测和引导修正。

Result: 在四个dLLMs上的实验表明，DiffuGuard对六种不同越狱方法的攻击成功率从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持了模型效用和效率。

Conclusion: dLLMs具有显著的内在安全潜力，DiffuGuard通过解决贪婪重掩码策略的有害偏差和去噪路径依赖问题，有效提升了dLLMs的安全性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决高质量多模态科学推理基准数据集手动创建成本高、不可扩展的问题，探索自动化生成多模态问答对的可行性。

Method: 开发了TQA-to-MMQA转换框架，建立了多维度的MMQA质量评估标准，并构建了Q-Mirror智能代理系统，将MMQA生成和评估整合到闭环迭代优化流程中。

Result: 实验表明，虽然最先进的模型能够生成MMQA，但输出质量仍有明显差距；顶级理解模型在MMQA质量评估中与人类判断高度一致；Q-Mirror代理将平均得分从78.90提升到85.22，通过率从72%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模科学基准数据集的建设提供了可行路径，证明了通过智能代理系统可以显著提升多模态问答对的质量。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs价值观表达的两种方式（内在表达和提示表达）的底层机制差异，这对价值观对齐和角色引导应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两种方法进行机制分析：(1) 价值观向量 - 从残差流中提取代表价值观机制的特征方向；(2) 价值观神经元 - 识别对价值观表达有贡献的MLP神经元。

Result: 发现内在和提示价值观机制部分共享诱导价值观表达的关键组件，但也各有独特元素。内在机制促进词汇多样性，提示机制主要强化指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 两种价值观表达机制在可操控性（提示>内在）和响应多样性（内在>提示）方面存在系统性差异，这对LLMs的价值观对齐设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

### [134] [Speculative Verification: Exploiting Information Gain to Refine Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24328)
*Sungkyun Kim,Jaemin Kim,Dogyung Yoon,Jiho Shin,Junyeol Lee,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verification(SV)方法，通过动态预测推测精度和调整验证长度来优化推测解码，提高大语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在推测精度低时，拒绝令牌的开销会抵消其优势，特别是在大批量处理时效率受限。

Method: 引入一个与草稿模型大小相似的辅助模型来估计草稿模型和目标模型分布的对齐程度，动态调整验证长度以减少计算浪费。

Result: 在9种模型组合和多种批量大小(4-80)的实验中，SV始终优于传统推测解码和目标模型标准解码，最高提升2倍性能，大批量设置下平均加速1.4倍。

Conclusion: SV方法具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用性，无需修改草稿或目标模型，与现有推测解码变体兼容，能显著提升大语言模型推理效率。

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

### [135] [AlignX: Advancing Multilingual Large Language Models with Multilingual Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24338)
*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignX是一个两阶段框架，通过表示层对齐和多语言指令微调来提升预训练大语言模型的多语言性能，特别是针对非主导语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在非主导语言上的性能和跨语言对齐往往较差，现有的大规模多语言语料微调方法通常导致对齐不精确和知识转移不理想。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征整合来对齐多语言表示；第二阶段通过多语言指令微调来激发LLM的多语言能力。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法增强了LLM的多语言通用能力和跨语言生成能力，使多语言表示更加接近并改善了跨语言对齐。

Conclusion: AlignX框架有效提升了预训练大语言模型的多语言性能，特别是在跨语言对齐方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

### [136] [Beyond Repetition: Text Simplification and Curriculum Learning for Data-Constrained Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24356)
*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究在数据受限环境下语言模型预训练中的课程学习，探讨文本简化数据增强和复杂度排序对表示质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数语言模型预训练研究关注大数据集，而在数据受限环境下，训练数据顺序和包含同一文本的替代版本的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于平行语料库（人类写作段落与LLM简化版本对齐），测试四种数据调度策略：重复暴露、低到高复杂度、高到低、交错排序，通过微调和零样本性能评估表示质量。

Result: 添加简化数据相比重复暴露基线能提升微调和零样本性能；较小模型从低到高复杂度排序中获益，而较大模型在交错排序中表现更好。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的预训练中，文本简化数据增强和复杂度排序策略能有效提升模型表示质量，且效果因模型规模而异。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了强化中训练(RMT)作为大语言模型开发的新中间阶段，通过动态token预算、课程自适应采样和双训练策略，显著提升模型性能并减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型开发只有预训练和后训练两阶段，缺乏中间阶段来获得更强的性能提升。识别了三个关键挑战：推理步骤过多导致训练低效、token熵分布不平衡被忽视、token信息利用不足。

Method: 提出RMT框架：1) 动态token预算机制限制不必要推理步骤；2) 课程自适应采样方法实现从易到难的渐进学习；3) 结合强化学习和下一token预测的双训练策略。

Result: 在语言建模中比现有方法性能提升高达64.91%，同时推理长度减少到21%。强化中训练获得的检查点对后续后训练也有益，在数学领域提升达18.76%。

Conclusion: 强化中训练是大语言模型开发的重要补充阶段，RMT框架能有效解决训练效率、token熵分布和信息利用问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HarmMetric Eval基准，用于评估大语言模型有害性度量和评判器的质量，发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏系统性基准来评估各种有害性度量和评判器的质量，导致报告的越狱攻击有效性等风险缺乏可信度。

Method: 构建包含代表性有害提示及多样化有害/无害模型响应的高质量数据集，设计灵活评分机制兼容各种度量和评判器。

Result: 实验发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判器，挑战了LLM在该领域优越性的普遍认知。

Conclusion: HarmMetric Eval基准为评估有害性度量和评判器提供了系统方法，揭示了传统指标在特定任务中的优势。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

TL;DR: LLaDA-MoE是一个基于混合专家架构的大语言扩散模型，在20T token上从头训练，通过仅激活1.4B参数实现高效推理，性能超越之前的扩散语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将稀疏MoE架构集成到掩码扩散语言模型的训练目标中，在保持少量激活参数的同时发挥MoE的优势，为扩散语言模型探索提供新方向。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，训练容量为7B参数但推理时仅激活1.4B参数，使用掩码扩散语言模型训练目标。

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越了LLaDA、LLaDA 1.5和Dream等扩散语言模型，指令调优版本LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct在知识理解、代码生成、数学推理等方面表现与Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct相当。

Conclusion: MoE架构在扩散语言模型中仍然能发挥其优势，为高效推理和模型性能提升提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的Text-to-SQL方法在BIRD等挑战性基准测试中仍显著落后于人类专家，现有测试时扩展方法缺乏协调策略且忽视模型内部推理过程。

Method: 采用协调测试时扩展策略，结合三个不同视角：i) 通过强化学习增强的内在推理进行内部扩展，ii) 通过迭代精化进行顺序扩展，iii) 使用多样化合成和锦标赛选择进行并行扩展。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到81.67%的执行准确率，在官方排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: Agentar-Scale-SQL展示了一条通向人类水平性能的有效路径，是一个易于适应新数据库和更强大语言模型的通用框架。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward
human-level performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL基准主要是英文的，限制了多语言进展，需要创建能评估跨语言能力的基准。

Method: 将Spider 2.0扩展到8种语言（英、德、法、西、葡、日、中、越），保持结构难度同时增加语言和方言变异性。

Result: 最先进LLM仅达到4%执行准确率，而协作式语言代理方法将准确率提升到15%，但相比MultiSpider 1.0的60%仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 存在显著的多语言差距，需要开发跨语言鲁棒的方法以支持实际企业部署。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CDT（认知-领域-任务）框架，通过三个维度全面评估大语言模型能力，并应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择，实验显示该框架能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估基准往往关注孤立能力，缺乏全面评估框架。需要更全面的评估方法来衡量LLM的综合能力。

Method: 提出CDT框架，结合Cattell-Horn-Carroll认知理论，从认知层面扩展模型能力定义，在认知、领域和任务三个维度上评估模型能力。

Result: 实验表明能力指标与下游性能相关性良好，数据选择在通用和特定基准上分别达到44.3和45.4分，比基线提高1.6和2.2分。

Conclusion: CDT框架在模型能力评估和数据选择方面具有有效性和实用性，为全面评估LLM能力提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了替代Next Token Prediction（NTP）的新兴方法，将其分为五大类：多令牌预测、计划后生成、潜在推理、连续生成方法和非Transformer架构，旨在解决NTP在长期规划、错误累积和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP范式虽然推动了LLMs的成功，但也导致了长期规划能力差、错误累积和计算效率低等持续性问题，因此需要探索替代方案来克服这些限制。

Method: 通过系统分类和综合分析，将替代NTP的方法分为五大类：多令牌预测（预测多个未来令牌）、计划后生成（先制定高层计划再解码）、潜在推理（在连续潜在空间进行自回归）、连续生成方法（通过扩散、流匹配等进行并行迭代优化）、非Transformer架构（通过模型结构规避NTP）。

Result: 建立了替代NTP方法的分类体系，为研究提供了清晰的框架，展示了各种方法如何从不同角度解决NTP的局限性。

Conclusion: 该综述为开发超越令牌级生成限制的新型自然语言处理模型提供了分类指导，有望推动下一代变革性模型的发展。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法主要评估与偏见无关的通用语言理解任务，而文化常识与社会偏见都源于社会规范和价值观，去偏对文化常识的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出SOBACO基准，以统一格式评估LLMs的社会偏见和文化常识，并在多个LLMs上测试去偏方法的影响。

Result: 去偏方法显著降低了LLMs在文化常识任务上的表现，最高导致75%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: 开发去偏方法时需要考虑与文化常识的权衡，以提升LLMs的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别评估指标（如词错误率）主要受高频词影响，掩盖了罕见词、命名实体和领域特定词汇等关键错误，需要更精细的错误分析方法。

Method: 开发了一种结合动态规划和波束搜索评分的新型对齐算法，相比传统文本对齐方法能更准确地定位个体错误。

Result: 该算法提供了更准确的个体错误对齐，实现了可靠的错误分析，并已通过PyPI发布。

Conclusion: 提出的对齐算法能够有效揭示语音识别系统中被聚合指标掩盖的关键错误，为精细错误分析提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于后处理过滤的缓解策略存在延迟高、计算开销大且不兼容流式生成的问题，需要一种实时、高效的LLM安全防护方案。

Method: 采用轻量级自我监控模块通过表示工程在token级别检查高层意图，配合自我修复模块进行原位修正，无需单独对话审查。

Result: 在四个LLM和三个隐私泄露场景下的实验表明，Self-Sanitize实现了优异的缓解性能，且对延迟和资源使用影响极小，不降低LLM效用。

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize为LLM部署提供了实用且鲁棒的安全解决方案，支持实时流式监控和无缝修复。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Motivation: 分析GRPO算法在训练思维链推理时面临的三个挑战：思维与答案间的梯度耦合、有限并行采样导致的稀疏奖励信号、以及不稳定的优势估计。

Method: 提出GRPO-MA方法，通过从每个思维过程生成多个答案，降低思维优势的方差，实现更稳健和高效的优化。

Result: 理论分析显示思维优势方差随每个思维答案数增加而降低；实验验证GRPO-MA减少了梯度尖峰，在数学、代码和多模态任务上显著提升性能和训练效率。

Conclusion: 增加每个思维的答案数量能持续提升模型性能，GRPO-MA为思维链推理训练提供了更有效的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

*Haewon Park,Sangwoo Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUIT方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，显著减少了知识编辑对语言模型的扰动，在保持高编辑效果的同时大幅提升了知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在修改MLP层时没有对关键向量和值向量施加约束，导致对编辑模型产生显著扰动，需要一种更精确的编辑方法。

Method: 提出SUIT方法，识别并仅修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，而不是对整个MLP层进行无约束修改。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，SUIT相比强基线方法显著提高了知识保留能力，同时保持了高编辑效果。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了编辑的关键子空间，提供了一种更精确、扰动更小的知识编辑方法，进一步分析验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

TL;DR: 提出了Samiksha，一个与公民社会组织和社区成员共同创建的社区驱动评估流程，用于在医疗等关键领域对大型语言模型进行文化感知的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型评估通常缺乏对终端用户现实生活的关注，特别是在医疗等关键领域需要超越人工或模拟任务，反映社区日常需求、文化实践和细微背景的评估。

Method: 与公民社会组织和社区成员共同创建社区驱动评估流程，通过社区反馈确定评估内容、构建基准测试方式以及评分方法，实现可扩展的自动化基准测试。

Result: 在印度医疗领域的应用表明，该方法能够有效评估多语言大型语言模型处理细微社区健康查询的能力。

Conclusion: Samiksha为大型语言模型提供了情境基础和包容性评估的可扩展路径，强调了社区参与在模型评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

*Shaohao Rui,Kaitao Chen,Weijie Ma,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med是一个端到端框架，通过不确定性引导的长度校准来增强医学LLMs的自适应思维能力，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学LLMs对所有问题都进行冗长推理，导致实际应用中的推理成本增加。需要让模型对简单问题思考更少，对复杂问题思考更多。

Method: 首先生成多个候选输出，评估每个候选的正确性和不确定性，然后通过不确定性引导的长度校准模块估计问题难度。对低难度正确输出惩罚长推理路径，对高难度错误输出鼓励扩展思维链。

Result: 在六个公共医学QA基准测试中，平均实现了6.4倍的推理长度减少，同时性能仅有最小程度的下降。模型自发发展出"不思考"和"思考"两种推理模式。

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med有效提升了医学LLMs的自适应思维能力，在性能和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡，能够动态抑制冗余推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

TL;DR: 使用大规模视觉语言模型模拟阅读障碍，通过识别和扰动人工词汇处理单元来复制阅读障碍的关键特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究阅读障碍的方法在测试因果假设方面存在局限，需要新的计算框架来研究阅读障碍的潜在机制。

Method: 在视觉语言模型中识别视觉词汇形式选择性单元，并针对性地消融这些单元，同时保持随机单元的消融作为对照。

Result: 选择性消融词汇处理单元导致阅读任务受损，但一般视觉和语言理解能力保持完整，模型复制了阅读障碍患者的语音缺陷特征。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个用于研究阅读障碍的计算框架，成功模拟了阅读障碍的关键特征。

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多语言自动语音识别有所进展，但日常语音中常见的语码转换（混合使用多种语言）仍是一个严重未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 提出HiKE框架，包含高质量自然语码转换数据、借词标签和分层语码转换级别标注方案（词级、短语级、句子级）。

Result: 评估显示大多数多语言ASR模型初始处理语码转换困难，但通过使用语码转换数据进行微调可以显著提升能力。

Conclusion: HiKE为韩英语码转换研究提供了首个全球可访问的评估框架，能够系统评估模型在不同级别语码转换上的表现，并证明微调可以有效提升语码转换ASR能力。

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE
will be available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学中宣传性语言日益增多，可能破坏证据的客观评估、阻碍研究发展并侵蚀对科学的信任。

Method: 制定形式化的炒作语言识别指南，将其应用于NIH资助申请语料库的标注，然后评估传统文本分类器和语言模型在此任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 该任务具有语言复杂性，可能需要领域知识和时间事实意识。这是首次将炒作检测作为自然语言处理任务进行研究。

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时面临严重的计算和内存瓶颈，现有可训练稀疏注意力方法引入过多额外参数并破坏预训练-微调工作流程，导致收敛缓慢和加速困难。

Method: InfLLM-V2采用密集-稀疏可切换注意力框架，通过无参数架构修改重用密集注意力参数，短序列使用密集注意力，长序列平滑切换到稀疏注意力，并提供了高效实现来减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明InfLLM-V2比密集注意力快4倍，在长上下文理解和思维链推理任务中分别保持98.1%和99.7%的性能，基于该框架训练并开源了MiniCPM4.1混合推理模型。

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2成功解决了长序列处理的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著加速，为研究社区提供了可复现的实现方案。

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了unPact框架，通过提示词归因和贡献追踪来可解释地分析大语言模型中的遗忘机制，发现现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么知识未被真正擦除，要么导致灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管遗忘方法被广泛探索，但由于难以追踪大语言模型复杂架构中的知识，对其机制的可解释性分析仍然稀缺。

Method: 提出了unPact框架，通过量化提示词中每个token对输出的影响，进行遗忘前后的比较分析。

Result: 在6种主流遗忘方法、3个大语言模型和3个基准测试中发现：遗忘通过破坏对关键词的关注而显得有效；大部分知识未被真正擦除，通过强调关键词即可恢复；灾难性遗忘源于对所有token的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么知识仍可通过关键词强调恢复（不足），要么因灾难性遗忘导致通用性能崩溃（过度破坏），距离可靠的遗忘仍有差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单次LLM评估评分的可靠性问题，发现存在评分不稳定、校准差、评分压缩和频繁平局等系统性缺陷。

Method: 提出了三种潜在评估方法：(i)基于整数评分的概率加权评分，(ii)验证器风格的"是"概率，(iii)在评分位置训练的线性探针。

Result: 潜在方法在成对和单评分基准测试中匹配或超越标准提示方法，在成对准确性和列表排序方面有持续提升。概率加权评分在单评分相关性方面表现最强。

Conclusion: 潜在信息为无参考评估提供了确定性和更具区分度的信号，可以改进选择和训练方法如Best-of-N、多教师蒸馏和路由。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

TL;DR: 提出了MemGen动态生成记忆框架，通过记忆触发器和记忆编织器让LLM智能体在推理过程中动态生成和利用潜在记忆，实现记忆与认知的紧密交织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆范式存在局限：参数化记忆强制调整模型参数，检索式记忆将经验外部化到结构化数据库，但都无法模拟人类认知中推理与记忆的流畅交织。

Method: MemGen包含记忆触发器（监控智能体推理状态决定显式记忆调用）和记忆编织器（以当前状态为刺激构建潜在token序列作为机器原生记忆来丰富推理）。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，MemGen超越领先的外部记忆系统ExpeL和AWM达38.22%，超过GRPO达13.44%，并表现出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemGen无需显式监督就能自发演化出类似人类的记忆能力（规划记忆、程序记忆和工作记忆），表明机器认知向更自然形式发展的新兴轨迹。

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在推理任务上的突破严重依赖大规模高质量数据集，但这些数据通常需要人工标注，难以扩展。现有数据合成方法存在数据质量不一致和无法动态适应模型能力演变的问题。

Method: 采用三个智能体协同进化：求解器从成功和失败轨迹的偏好反馈中持续优化推理能力；教师根据求解器的弱点自适应地设计更具挑战性的问题；生成器提炼教师的问题设计策略以实现可扩展的高保真课程生成。

Result: 仅从100个种子问题开始，Socratic-Solver-8B在七个数学推理基准测试中平均比先前数据合成方法提升20.2个百分点。Socratic-Generator-32B生成的合成数据使学生LLM在这些基准测试中表现优于其他最先进的商业LLM。

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero框架通过完全自主的数据生成和课程学习，有效解决了高质量训练数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

Result: 在多种主流模型和基准测试中验证了注意力头之间的相似性，ProxyAttn实现了10.3倍注意力加速和2.4倍预填充加速，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度块重要性评估，ProxyAttn在性能和效率上都优于现有方法，为长文本任务提供了高效的稀疏注意力解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

Result: 在8个基准测试和5个模型骨干上的实验表明，LatentEvolve比最先进的TTS方法（如LatentSeek和TTRL）性能提升高达13.33%，并展现出卓越的跨领域和跨骨干泛化能力。

Conclusion: 昼夜交替过程促进了LLM测试时扩展的快速和慢速进化，完全无监督地模拟了人类认知动态，显著提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

TL;DR: SeaPO是一种战略错误放大方法，通过向模型偏好优化中引入三种常见错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更错误，从而增强偏好学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法在LLM偏好优化中，由于模型评分或生成能力有限，正负样本质量可能相似，导致偏好学习优化困难。

Method: 利用LLMs中常见的三种错误类型，在模型偏好优化中引入特定错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更错误，并通过基于偏好的训练来减少这些错误。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估显示，生成的数据显著提高了整体模型性能，特别是在真实性方面观察到5-10个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 任务性能取决于引入的错误类型：注入最常见错误类型可提高相关任务性能，而混合错误类型则带来更广泛的性能提升，大多数任务稳定改进，少数任务显著提升。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如BLEU和BERT相似度分数无法准确反映指令的时空构建方面，需要开发更准确的评估方法。

Method: 开发基于树的自动评估指标，专门针对逐步组装指令的时空合理性进行评估。

Result: 新指标与人工标注的错误计数和人类质量评分相关性更好，对专门设计来混淆文本相似度指标的对抗性示例更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于树的评估指标在评估缝纫指令的时空合理性方面优于传统文本相似度指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

TL;DR: KnowGuard提出了一种"调查后再弃权"的新范式，通过系统化的知识图谱探索来改进临床决策中的弃权机制，显著提升了诊断准确性并减少了不必要的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医疗场景中难以有效弃权，经常在信息不足时给出过度自信的回答。传统弃权方法仅依赖模型自评估，缺乏基于外部医学证据的系统性知识边界识别策略。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1)证据发现阶段通过图谱扩展和直接检索系统探索医学知识空间；2)证据评估阶段基于患者上下文和对话历史对证据进行多因素排序，自适应调整探索策略。

Result: 在开放式多轮临床基准测试中，KnowGuard优于最先进的弃权方法，诊断准确率提高3.93%，平均减少7.27次不必要的交互。

Conclusion: KnowGuard通过系统化的知识图谱探索实现了更有效的临床决策弃权机制，为医疗AI提供了更安全可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

TL;DR: 提出了DiaCDM模型，首次在对话场景中实现认知诊断，通过教育理论中的IRE框架和基于图的编码方法，显著提高了诊断准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型无法处理动态、非结构化的教师-学生对话，且难以从冗长对话中准确提取诊断语义。

Method: 采用教育理论中的IRE框架设计对话诊断框架，开发基于图的编码方法整合教师问题和相关知识组件来精确捕捉关键信息。

Result: 在三个真实对话数据集上的实验表明，DiaCDM显著提高了诊断准确性，同时增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: DiaCDM为教师评估学生认知状态提供了强大工具，是对话场景中认知诊断的首个探索。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV是一个基于语义相似性的KV缓存共享框架，通过模糊令牌匹配和位置编码优化，在大语言模型推理中实现显著加速和内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要依赖精确令牌匹配或共享前缀，但在语义相似但词汇不同的提示场景中效果有限，这限制了在多文档摘要和对话代理等任务中的效率。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希进行令牌嵌入的模糊匹配，结合旋转位置编码来保持位置信息，选择性重用参考提示的KV缓存以减少冗余计算。

Result: 在多样化摘要数据集上实验显示，对于5k令牌输入，最高实现6.25倍加速和42%的GPU内存降低，且质量下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 语义感知的缓存共享在大语言模型高效推理中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，在医疗编码任务中仅达到45.9%准确率，需要专门的方法来改善其领域特定性能。

Method: 分层错误校正框架：分析错误模式（知识层58.4%、推理层39.6%、复杂度层2.0%），开发三阶段校正框架按层次重要性处理错误。

Result: 在医疗转录、法律文档分类、政治偏见检测和法律推理四个领域验证，跨五个LLM架构平均提升11.2个百分点，但在高基线任务中效果有限。

Conclusion: 系统错误分析可指导专业领域AI增强策略，特别适用于中等基线任务，同时需要理解框架边界以实现最优部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了LLM在心理健康危机检测和响应方面的能力，发现虽然LLM在明确危机披露时表现一致可靠，但在处理间接风险信号时存在系统性弱点，且存在不当或有害响应的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLM聊天机器人在高风险心理健康支持场景中的广泛应用，需要了解它们安全检测和响应急性心理健康危机的能力，但目前缺乏统一危机分类、标注基准和基于临床实践的评估。

Method: 建立了六个临床心理健康危机类别的统一分类法，策划了多样化评估数据集，制定了专家设计的响应适当性评估协议，系统性地对三种最先进LLM进行危机分类和安全响应能力基准测试。

Result: LLM在处理明确危机披露时高度一致可靠，但相当比例响应被评为不当或有害，开源模型失败率高于商业模型。存在处理间接风险信号的系统性弱点、依赖公式化默认回复、与用户情境不匹配等问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM部署中需要加强安全防护、改进危机检测和情境感知干预的紧迫性。建立的分类法、数据集和评估框架为AI驱动的心理健康支持研究奠定了基础，有助于减少伤害和保护脆弱用户。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语中的普遍特征，但大规模分析受限于需要人工标注，因为隐喻具有语境敏感性。

Method: 比较三种方法：检索增强生成（提供代码书）、提示工程（零样本、少样本、思维链策略）和微调（在人工标注文本上训练）。

Result: 最先进的闭源大语言模型能达到高准确率，微调方法的中位F1分数为0.79。人类与模型输出的差异主要是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中的灰色地带和概念挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并作为开发和改进隐喻识别协议及其理论基础的工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型可以在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，有效提升性能，特别是对小模型帮助最大，表明这些空间确实提供了额外的计算能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，以扩展模型的计算能力而不需要训练特殊标记。

Method: 通过实验确定有效的标记类型、数量和插入位置，分析模型在训练过程中何时开始利用扩展计算空间，并通过注意力图分析这些空间内的动态。

Result: 在1.7B到32B模型上的开放域问答和数学任务实验表明，适当的标记类型和数量各不相同，但将填充标记直接放在最终'Answer:'标记前最有效。小模型受益最大，SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct性能提升达12.372个百分点。

Conclusion: 扩展的计算空间确实提供了额外的计算能力而非冗余输入，注意力图显示这些空间通常延续原始注意力机制，有时聚焦于问题或答案选项，表明它们为问题解决进行了有意义的计算。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Motivation: 由于信息过载，长文档摘要能力日益重要，但西班牙语文档特别是法律领域缺乏此类摘要资源。

Method: 构建BOE-XSUM数据集，包含短摘要、原文和文档类型标签；在BOE-XSUM上微调中等规模LLM，并与零样本通用模型进行比较。

Result: 微调模型显著优于非专业模型，最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B比最佳零样本模型DeepSeek-R1性能提升24%（准确率41.6% vs. 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 针对特定领域微调的LLM在法律文档摘要任务上表现优异，BOE-XSUM数据集填补了西班牙法律文档摘要资源的空白。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅文本，但其复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不清楚，需要评估LLMs在风格模仿方面的表现。

Method: 集成TF-IDF字符n-grams与transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布进行文本对分类，无需监督训练或阈值调优。评估了三个模型家族的五个LLM和四种提示策略。

Result: 提示策略比模型大小对风格保真度影响更大：few-shot提示比zero-shot风格匹配准确率高23.5倍，完成提示达到99.9%与原始作者风格一致。人类论文困惑度平均29.5，而匹配的LLM输出仅15.2。

Conclusion: 风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为未来作者建模、检测和身份条件生成建立了可复现的基础，高保真模仿并不意味着人类般的不可预测性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

Motivation: 挑战当前关于推理能力需要海量数据训练的假设，探索在更少数据下实现推理能力涌现的可能性。

Method: 精心筛选和重采样开源数据集，设计评估指标识别有益数据，使用约2T高质量数据进行预训练，结合标准后训练流程。

Result: MobileLLM-R1-950M在AIME得分达到15.5，远超其他模型，且仅使用Qwen3 11.7%的数据量就能达到或超越其性能。

Conclusion: 推理能力的涌现不依赖于极端大规模语料库，高质量数据筛选比数据规模更重要，为高效训练推理模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

TL;DR: MAQuE是最大的医疗多轮问诊评估基准，包含3000个模拟患者代理，评估AI医生的问诊能力、对话技巧和患者体验等多方面表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI医生主要关注诊断技能，但忽视了优秀医生应具备的共情、耐心、清晰沟通等关键品质，需要全面评估医疗问诊能力。

Method: 构建包含3000个模拟患者代理的基准，这些代理具有多样语言模式、认知限制、情绪反应和被动披露倾向，并设计多维评估框架。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在评估维度上都面临重大挑战，最先进模型在问诊能力上仍有很大改进空间，对患者行为变化高度敏感。

Conclusion: 需要平衡性能和实用性，细粒度指标揭示了不同评估视角间的权衡，为现实临床环境中的AI医生开发提供重要指导。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

*Kaihong Li,Huichi Zhou,Bin Ma,Fangjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段检测框架SemanticShield，通过整合项目侧语义特征来防御推荐系统中的灌水攻击，利用LLM进行语义一致性评估，并在六种攻击策略上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注用户侧行为，忽略了项目侧特征（如标题和描述）中可能暴露的恶意意图，导致对灌水攻击的检测能力不足。

Method: 两阶段检测框架：第一阶段使用低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户；第二阶段采用基于LLM的审计来评估语义一致性，并通过强化学习微调轻量级LLM来增强审计模型。

Result: 在六种代表性攻击策略上的实验证明了SemanticShield的有效性，对未见过的攻击方法也显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemanticShield通过整合项目侧语义特征，显著提升了推荐系统对灌水攻击的检测能力，具有良好的实用性和泛化性。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了LLM置信度估计的传统观点，发现模型预测自身答案正确性的能力并不优于其他模型，提出通过注入历史正确性信息来构建广义正确性模型(GCM)，证明可靠置信度估计是可泛化的模型无关技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键应用中部署LLM需要准确且校准的置信度估计，但现有方法假设模型具有判断自身答案正确性的特权信息，这一假设可能不成立。

Method: 提出广义正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入目标模型的历史预测正确性信息，包括训练基于多LLM正确性数据的模型、使用历史作为上下文示例、以及后处理校准等方法。

Result: 在5个模型系列和MMLU、TriviaQA数据集上的评估显示，GCM能有效提升正确性预测，基于Qwen3-8B的GCM在选择性预测任务中表现良好，证明置信度估计是可泛化的技能。

Conclusion: 可靠的LLM置信度估计是通过系统编码正确性历史学习的可泛化、模型无关技能，而非依赖模型自省的特异性技能。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏只关注行为模仿，将教师模型的内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在蒸馏教师模型实现的基础计算机制

Method: 提出电路蒸馏方法：匹配功能对应的电路组件，引入反映这些组件诱导表征相似性的损失函数，仅调整学生模型的小部分目标参数

Result: 在实体追踪和心理理论任务上，电路蒸馏优于标准蒸馏，成功通过调整少量目标参数转移算法能力

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了转移机制的可行性，可能通过可解释和可控的内部学生机制实现教师目标能力的高效蒸馏

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Motivation: 追求AI时代快速语言文本生成的圣杯，解决现有语言生成模型速度慢的问题。

Method: 从预训练离散扩散语言模型初始化，采用积分KL散度最小化框架，结合分组奖励归一化、中间状态匹配和奖励引导祖先采样等技术。

Result: 在OpenWebText上超越所有加速语言生成模型、GPT-2基线和标准离散扩散模型，困惑度从62.2(8步)到18.4(128步)，仅1%熵损失和20倍更少训练时间。

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct是一种高效有效的蒸馏方法，能够实现眨眼间的语言生成，在蛋白质序列生成等任务上也验证了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Motivation: 现有的多模态方面级情感分析模型难以过滤噪声视觉信号，并有效对齐文本方面与跨模态的意见表达内容。

Method: 提出GateMABSA架构，集成语法、语义和融合感知的mLSTM：Syn-mLSTM引入语法结构，Sem-mLSTM强调方面-语义相关性，Fuse-mLSTM执行选择性多模态融合。

Result: 在两个Twitter基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，GateMABSA优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GateMABSA通过专门的mLSTM模块有效解决了多模态方面级情感分析中的噪声过滤和跨模态对齐挑战。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释性方法如直接logit归因和稀疏自编码器对LLM内部表示的理解有限，存在模型输出词汇表限制和特征名称不清晰等问题

Method: 结合符号表示和神经探测，使用向量符号架构将模型的残差流投影到可解释概念中，融合了稀疏自编码器和传统探测器的优势

Conclusion: 该工作推进了LLM向量空间中的信息解码，能够从神经表示中提取更具信息性、可解释性和结构化的特征

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Motivation: 针对语音识别系统在处理障碍语音时错误率较高的问题，研究如何利用大语言模型作为后处理模块来纠正这些错误，特别是解决跨说话人和数据集的泛化问题。

Method: 提出置信度提示方法，将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入LLM训练中，引导模型关注不确定的ASR区域并减少过度纠正。使用LLaMA 3.1模型进行微调，并与仅使用转录文本的微调和后验置信度过滤方法进行比较。

Result: 在Speech Accessibility Project自发语音数据上相对WER降低了10%，在TORGO数据集上相对WER降低了47%，证明了置信度感知微调在障碍语音处理中的有效性。

Conclusion: 置信度提示方法显著提高了大语言模型在障碍语音识别错误纠正中的性能，为处理语音障碍提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务上的表现，发现虽然模型在分布内数据上表现良好，但在泛化到不同因素（如程序长度、跟踪步骤）时存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务上的能力，该任务通过长跟踪序列外部化推理过程，每个步骤都很简单，不同于现有的算法问题。

Method: 训练小型Transformer模型，采用多种修改：替代位置编码、softmax替换、混合模型和短卷积等。

Result: 模型在分布内数据上达到强准确率，但在泛化到各种因素时表现出系统性失败，不过某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务上表现出色，但在泛化方面仍有挑战，某些架构修改可以改善但无法完全解决泛化问题。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

Motivation: 当前的数据分析智能体严重依赖基于专有模型的提示工程，而开源模型难以处理多样格式的大规模数据文件和现实分析需求的长时程、多步骤推理。

Method: DataMind采用：1）细粒度任务分类和递归易到难任务组合机制；2）知识增强的轨迹采样策略；3）动态可调的SFT和RL损失组合训练目标；4）内存高效且稳定的基于代码的多轮推理框架。

Result: 基于DataMind构建的DataMind-14B在多个数据分析基准测试中达到71.16%的平均分，超越了最强的专有基线DeepSeek-V3.1和GPT-5。DataMind-7B也在所有开源模型中表现最佳，得分68.10%。

Conclusion: DataMind成功构建了高性能的开源数据分析智能体，其框架和数据集将公开发布，为社区提供可操作的智能体训练见解。

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

Motivation: 解决传统晚交互模型（如ColBERT）中查询和文档分别编码后多向量匹配的局限性，实现更丰富的跨文档交互。

Method: 在相同上下文窗口中对查询和文档进行因果自注意力交互，然后从每个文档的最后一个token提取上下文嵌入表示。

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在词汇简化应用中面临隐私敏感和资源受限环境的挑战，且目标用户群体（如残障人士）对系统输出的安全性和正确性要求极高。

Method: 使用可本地部署的小型LLM，探索知识蒸馏与合成数据、上下文学习作为基线方法，并提出基于模型输出概率的有害简化过滤策略。

Result: 知识蒸馏能提升自动指标得分，但会增加有害简化；模型输出概率可作为检测有害简化的有效信号；提出的过滤策略能有效抑制有害简化同时保留有益简化。

Conclusion: 为小型LLM的高效安全词汇简化建立了基准，揭示了性能、效率和安全性之间的关键权衡，展示了实际部署的可行方法。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising
questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question

paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction
annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中表现出强大的能力，但这些模型往往存在语言偏见，在高资源语言（如英语）上的表现明显优于低资源语言。此外，还发现检索系统存在检索偏见，倾向于偏好某些信息。

Method: 使用AMC-16K数据集，通过完全多语言提示策略评估6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现。将任务提示翻译成每种语言，分析单语和跨语言性能差异。同时使用多语言嵌入模型研究检索偏见，分析检索声明的频率分布。

Result: 研究发现LLM行为中存在持续偏见，揭示了基于模型系列、规模和提示策略的关键趋势。检索偏见分析表明某些声明在不同帖子中被不成比例地检索，导致热门声明的检索性能被夸大，而较少见声明被低估。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了LLM行为中的持续偏见，并为改善多语言事实核查的公平性提供了建议。需要采取措施减少语言和检索偏见，确保模型在不同语言和声明类型间的公平表现。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

TL;DR: PbT是一种无需人工标注或平行数据的教师-学生两阶段流水线，通过压缩无配对样本为中间表示，训练学生模型重构输入，从而生成高质量合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源自然语言生成场景中只有原始输入或输出但缺乏配对数据的问题，避免依赖少量示例或大型LLM生成的高成本合成数据。

Method: 使用教师LLM将无配对样本压缩为中间表示，训练学生模型从中间表示重构输入，从而将输出与学生生成的输入配对。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，仅使用PbT数据训练的8B学生模型优于在70B教师生成语料上训练的模型，接近人类标注对的表现，以三分之一成本填补82%的性能差距。

Conclusion: PbT能生成与目标风格一致的简洁、忠实摘要，避免直接合成中的不匹配问题，在低资源NLG场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种使用NVFP4格式稳定训练大型语言模型的新方法，通过随机Hadamard变换、二维量化方案、随机舍入和选择性高精度层等技术，在4位精度下成功训练了120亿参数模型，性能与FP8基准相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模不断扩大，训练成本急剧增加。虽然FP8训练已被广泛采用，但转向更窄的4位精度(FP4)可以进一步提升计算速度和资源利用率，但4位量化在训练稳定性、收敛性和实现方面面临挑战。

Method: 集成随机Hadamard变换(RHT)来限制块级异常值，采用二维量化方案确保前向和后向传播的一致性表示，使用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计，并加入选择性高精度层。

Result: 在100万亿tokens上成功训练了120亿参数模型，这是迄今为止公开记录中最长的4位精度训练运行。训练损失和下游任务准确率与FP8基准相当。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合所提出的训练方法，代表了窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进步，为下一代更强大LLM的开发提供了高效训练方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Motivation: 现有LLM控制框架存在计算效率低、扩展性差和功能受限等问题，阻碍了研究进展和实际部署，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于vLLM构建统一框架，采用模块化架构，支持基于分析和学习的方法，提供细粒度参数控制和预计算控制向量，深度集成vLLM优化推理引擎。

Result: 实现5.5-11.4倍速度提升，有效缓解过度思考、减少幻觉等关键应用问题，将控制技术从研究工具转变为生产就绪能力。

Conclusion: EasySteer为可部署、可控的语言模型建立了关键基础设施，将控制从研究技术转变为生产就绪能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for
controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of
hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.
However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready
capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable
language models.

TL;DR: NAIPv2是一个用于科学论文质量评估的去偏高效框架，通过域内成对学习减少评分不一致性，引入RTS整合评分和置信度，在ICLR数据集上达到SOTA性能，并展现良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法推理成本高，而直接分数回归方法存在尺度不一致问题，需要开发高效且准确的论文质量评估框架。

Method: 采用域内成对学习减少评分偏差，引入Review Tendency Signal(RTS)概率性整合评审分数和置信度，构建NAIDv2大规模数据集进行训练。

Result: 在ICLR数据集上达到78.2% AUC和0.432 Spearman相关性，在NeurIPS数据集上展现良好泛化能力，预测分数从拒稿到口头报告类别持续上升。

Conclusion: NAIPv2建立了去偏且可扩展的自动化论文质量评估框架，为未来科学智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

TL;DR: 提出了Truthful Text Summarization (TTS)框架，通过激励对齐机制提高文本摘要的事实准确性，无需真实标签即可增强事实鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在合成多个文本时，缺乏对信息源准确性的有效激励，容易受到对抗性内容的影响。

Method: TTS框架包括四个步骤：(i)将草稿摘要分解为原子声明，(ii)获取每个信息源对每个声明的立场，(iii)使用改进的多任务同伴预测机制对信息源评分，(iv)在重新摘要前过滤不可靠信息源。

Result: 实验表明TTS提高了事实准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了流畅性，使信息暴露与信息性佐证对齐，并抑制了操纵行为。

Conclusion: TTS建立了形式化保证，使信息源的激励与信息性诚实对齐，使真实报告成为效用最大化策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出Learn2PD框架，通过训练轻量级自适应过滤器模型来预测每个token位置是否匹配最终输出，实现动态并行解码，显著提升LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码需要O(n)顺序步骤，限制了推理吞吐量。现有并行解码策略使用固定的启发式方法，无法适应输入特性，导致速度-质量权衡不理想。

Method: Learn2PD框架训练轻量级过滤器模型预测token位置是否正确预测，结合EoTP检测解码完成，避免冗余解码。

Result: 在LLaDA基准测试中实现最高22.58倍加速且无性能损失，结合KV-Cache可达57.51倍加速。

Conclusion: Learn2PD提供了一种灵活高效的并行解码方法，显著提升LLM推理效率，仅需分钟级GPU时间优化。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage
recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search
behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves
reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that large language models (LLMs) underperform
on mathematical and computer science tasks when these problems are translated
from Romanian into English, compared to their original Romanian format.
Accurate translation is critical for applications ranging from automatic
translations in programming competitions to the creation of high-quality
educational materials, as well as minimizing errors or fraud in human
translations. This study shows that robust large language models (LLMs) can
maintain or even enhance their performance in translating less common languages
when given well-structured prompts. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with
appropriate supervision, can be reliably used for the automatic translation of
IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)-style tasks. We evaluate several
translation methods across multiple LLMs, including OpenRoLLM, Llama 3.1 8B,
Llama 3.2 3B and GPT-4o, assessing their translation accuracy and performance
stability through repeated runs. Additionally, we augment the OJI (Romanian
County-Level Informatics Olympiad) Romanian dataset with accurate English
translations, enhancing its utility for future LLM training and evaluation.
Through detailed syntactic and semantic analyses, we confirm that with human
oversight, LLMs can serve as a viable solution for multilingual
problem-solving. We also compare the translation quality of LLMs against human
translators, as evaluated by a certified expert, underscoring the potential of
LLMs in realworld scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推测解码需要目标模型和draft模型具有相同的词汇表，这在词汇表很大的目标LLM上会产生不必要的推理开销，特别是在内存受限的边缘设备上

Method: VocabTrim重构draft模型的LM头，只包含从目标模型词汇表中选择的最常采样的有限token集合

Result: 在Spec-Bench上，该方法将Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct的内存受限加速比提高了16%

Conclusion: 虽然限制词汇表会轻微降低接受率，但显著减少了内存受限环境下的draft延迟，从而实现了更高的内存受限加速比

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3

*Tsung-Chih Lai,Jia-Han Shih,Yi-Hau Chen*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了向上等级流动性曲线作为衡量代际流动性的新指标，捕捉整个父母收入分布中的向上流动。通过条件化单一父母收入等级来消除聚合偏差，并基于copula的非参数估计方法优于核方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代际流动性测量存在聚合偏差问题，需要开发能捕捉整个父母收入分布中向上流动的新指标，以更准确地评估社会流动性。

Method: 提出基于copula的非参数估计方法，以及针对条件化版本的两步半参数估计器，结合分布回归建立渐近性质。

Result: 美国数据应用显示，在低收入至中低收入家庭中，白人的向上流动性显著优于黑人群体。

Conclusion: 向上等级流动性曲线提供了更准确的代际流动性测量工具，揭示了不同种族群体在流动性方面的显著差异。

Abstract: We introduce the upward rank mobility curve as a new measure of
intergenerational mobility that captures upward movements across the entire
parental income distribution. Our approach extends Bhattacharya and Mazumder
(2011) by conditioning on a single parental income rank, thereby eliminating
aggregation bias. We show that the measure can be characterized solely by the
copula of parent and child income, and we propose a nonparametric copula-based
estimator with better properties than kernel-based alternatives. For a
conditional version of the measure without such a representation, we develop a
two-step semiparametric estimator based on distribution regression and
establish its asymptotic properties. An application to U.S. data reveals that
whites exhibit significant upward mobility dominance over blacks among
lower-middle-income families.

*Zhuoxun Li,Clifford M. Hurvich*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预白化核估计器和局部留一频域交叉验证的异方差和自相关一致协方差矩阵估计器，通过交叉验证对数似然函数同时选择预白化VAR阶数和带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Andrews和Monahan(1992)的特征值调整规则在回归变量具有非零均值时可能被不必要地触发并产生有害影响，需要改进现有方法。

Method: 使用预白化核估计器和局部留一频域交叉验证(FDCV)，通过交叉验证对数似然函数同时选择预白化VAR阶数和带宽，预白化VAR使用无特征值调整的Burg方法估计。

Result: 通过蒙特卡洛模拟和三个实证例子，证明了特征值调整的缺陷和我们方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法避免了不必要的特征值调整，在异方差和自相关一致协方差矩阵估计中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation
consistent covariance matrix estimator based on the prewhitened kernel
estimator and a localized leave-one-out frequency domain cross-validation
(FDCV). We adapt the cross-validated log likelihood (CVLL) function to
simultaneously select the order of the prewhitening vector autoregression (VAR)
and the bandwidth. The prewhitening VAR is estimated by the Burg method without
eigen adjustment as we find the eigen adjustment rule of Andrews and Monahan
(1992) can be triggered unnecessarily and harmfully when regressors have
nonzero mean. Through Monte Carlo simulations and three empirical examples, we
illustrate the flaws of eigen adjustment and the reliability of our method.

*Andrii Babii,Luca Barbaglia,Eric Ghysels,Jonas Striaukas*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 使用混合数据抽样机器学习面板数据回归方法，结合标准宏观数据和每日新闻数据，对欧元区GDP增长进行即时预测，比较直接预测欧元区总体与加权各国预测的优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更准确地进行欧元区GDP即时预测，特别是在COVID-19疫情期间，探索小中型国家信息和新闻数据的价值，以及官方统计数据滞后时的预测方法。

Method: 采用混合数据抽样机器学习面板数据回归方法，使用19个欧元区国家的面板数据，结合标准宏观发布数据和每日新闻数据，比较直接预测总体与加权各国预测两种方法。

Result: 发现小中型国家的信息对预测至关重要，特别是在疫情期间；新闻数据在官方统计数据滞后时具有附加价值；理论上证明使用汇总面板数据回归预测各组成部分优于直接预测总体。

Conclusion: 通过汇总各国预测的方法优于直接预测欧元区总体，小中型国家信息和新闻数据对提高预测准确性有重要贡献，特别是在经济动荡时期。

Abstract: The paper studies the nowcasting of Euro area Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth using mixed data sampling machine learning panel data regressions with
both standard macro releases and daily news data. Using a panel of 19 Euro area
countries, we investigate whether directly nowcasting the Euro area aggregate
is better than weighted individual country nowcasts. Our results highlight the
importance of the information from small- and medium-sized countries,
particularly when including the COVID-19 pandemic period. The empirical
analysis is supplemented by studying the so-called Big Four -- France, Germany,
Italy, and Spain -- and the value added of news data when official statistics
are lagging. From a theoretical perspective, we formally show that the
aggregation of individual components forecasted with pooled panel data
regressions is superior to direct aggregate forecasting due to lower estimation
error.

### [202] [Localizing Adversarial Attacks To Produces More Imperceptible Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22710)
*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了局部对抗性攻击，通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，相比全局攻击显著降低了平均像素扰动，提高了PSNR和SSIM指标，但计算成本增加且攻击成功率略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估其有效性、不可感知性和计算效率。

Method: 使用FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法，通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，量化评估局部对抗攻击的效果。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击具有显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM，但计算成本增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法（如PGD和C&W）比单步方法（如FGSM）对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 局部对抗攻击在不可感知性方面具有优势，但需要权衡计算成本和攻击成功率，为攻击策略的改进和鲁棒防御系统的设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

### [203] [In-Context Learning can Perform Continual Learning Like Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22764)
*Liuwang Kang,Fan Wang,Shaoshan Liu,Hung-Chyun Chou,Chuan Lin,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文持续学习（ICCL）的方法，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习能力，发现特定大语言模型在分布式练习中表现出类似人类的记忆保留模式，并提出了衡量学习算法与人类记忆相似度的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以通过上下文学习快速适应新任务，但其在连续多任务环境中的长期记忆保持和跨任务知识积累能力尚未得到充分研究。受人类记忆研究的启发，本文旨在探索ICL在多任务设置中的记忆保持特性。

Method: 提出in-context continual learning（ICCL）框架，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习。在马尔可夫链基准上进行实验，分析分布式练习对记忆保持的影响，并提出人类记忆相似度指标来量化学习算法与人类记忆模式的匹配程度。

Result: 实验表明特定大语言模型在分布式练习中表现出类似人类的记忆保留模式，存在记忆保持的"最佳间隔"。线性注意力模型（如MAMBA和RWKV）展现出特别接近人类记忆模式的特性，尽管其保持性能不如基于Transformer的LLMs。

Conclusion: ICCL既具有认知合理性又具有实际有效性，提供了一种仅依赖推理的持续学习范式，能够缓解灾难性遗忘并解决传统持续学习方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

*Mounssif Krouka,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持模型异构的通信高效分布式学习框架，通过共享融合层输出实现隐私保护和模块化组合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构在协作学习中的互操作性和隐私保护挑战

Method: 采用统一的融合层输出维度，将模型划分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，仅共享融合层输出

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分割学习基线，实现了更优的通信效率，同时在异构架构上保持稳定的训练性能

Conclusion: 该框架在通信效率和模型异构性支持方面表现优异，为分布式协作学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [205] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自注意力机制的容量限制，提出了关系图识别(RGR)框架，推导出容量缩放定律：$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 对于恢复 $m'$ 个关系是必要且充分的，并为多头注意力提供了基于容量的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知自注意力能够学习token之间的关系，但缺乏对其容量的形式化理解：在给定预算下，单层能可靠恢复多少种不同的关系？

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道表示为具有 $m'$ 条有向边的图，分析在不同压缩条件下恢复邻居关系的能力，通过信息论下界和显式构造证明容量缩放定律。

Result: 推导出容量缩放定律 $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$，实验验证了性能阈值与预测的容量缩放相匹配，并证实了将 $D_K$ 分配到多个小头中可以减轻干扰，增加可恢复关系的数量。

Conclusion: 结果为自注意力容量提供了具体的缩放定律，并为在头之间分配键-查询预算提供了原则性设计规则，特别是在压缩条件下多头机制的必要性。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对表格数据的黑盒决策型对抗攻击方法，结合无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索，在最小化查询次数的前提下有效攻击各类表格模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化数据中的对抗鲁棒性研究相对不足，与视觉和语言领域相比存在明显差距，需要专门针对表格数据的攻击方法。

Method: 结合无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索，能够高效地在离散和连续特征空间中导航，仅需最小化的oracle访问。

Result: 攻击方法在多种模型上成功攻击了几乎整个测试集，包括传统机器学习分类器和基于大语言模型的流程，成功率持续超过90%，且每个实例仅需少量查询。

Conclusion: 表格模型对对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，现实世界决策系统迫切需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

*Yaswanth Chittepu,Prasann Singhal,Greg Durrett,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPO-PoP方法，通过偏好强度的顺序信号来推断自适应边界，在RLHF中改善泛化能力和对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用无边界、固定边界或基于评分的简单边界，无法处理不同偏好强度的变化，且依赖可能不准确的人类评分。

Method: 利用偏好间的偏好（PoP）标注来推断每个数据点的自适应边界，扩展DPO方法为DPO-PoP。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP优于原始DPO、固定边界DPO和真实边界DPO，并展示了判别性能与生成性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过偏好强度建模可以改善对齐效果，提出了两种采样策略来平衡判别和生成性能。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了针对在线学习排序算法的对抗攻击框架，能够通过O(log T)次操作成功提升目标物品排名并导致线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在线学习排序算法在信息检索和推荐系统中广泛应用，但其对协同对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了两种攻击策略：针对CascadeUCB1的CascadeOFA和针对PBM-UCB的PBMOFA，通过操纵用户反馈来误导学习算法。

Result: 理论证明两种策略仅需O(log T)次操作即可成功，并在真实数据上的实验验证了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 在线学习排序算法存在严重安全漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御机制来应对此类对抗攻击。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经正切核理论分析图神经网络中的邻域采样方法，发现不同采样方法在有限样本下会产生不同的后验高斯过程，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同结果，且没有单一采样方法在所有情况下都最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样是训练大规模图神经网络的重要技术，能控制内存和时间消耗，但其系统性行为缺乏理论理解。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具分析几种标准邻域采样方法，通过无限宽网络对应的高斯过程来表征训练动态。

Result: 有限样本下不同采样方法产生不同的后验高斯过程，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同结果；后验协方差不可比较，与观察到的没有单一采样方法占优的现象一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法在理论上有系统性差异，但不存在普遍最优的采样策略，这解释了实践中观察到的现象。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业工厂和能源生产商的无计划停机成本高昂且难以维护，现有声学异常检测研究主要依赖通用工业或合成数据集，针对水力发电厂的研究较少。

Method: 在强噪声条件下进行声学预处理，提取时域和频域特征，然后对LSTM AE、K-Means和OC-SVM三种机器学习模型进行基准测试，使用奥地利Rodundwerk II抽水蓄能电站的两个真实数据集。

Result: One-Class SVM实现了最佳准确率（ROC AUC 0.966-0.998）和最短训练时间的平衡，LSTM自编码器提供了强大的检测能力（ROC AUC 0.889-0.997）但计算成本较高。

Conclusion: OC-SVM是水力发电厂声学异常检测的有效方法，在准确性和效率方面表现优异，适合实际工业应用。

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

Method: 扩展Conformal Fairness框架到联邦学习设置，分析不同人口群体的公平性差距

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上进行了实证验证，充分利用了可交换性假设

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效审计联邦学习模型的公平性

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下的奖励感知蒸馏提供了一个理论基础扎实且实际高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI中学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和可解耦表示的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种方法。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调多层感知机头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类任务中，表示比微调编码器基线紧凑9倍、鲁棒1.5倍，保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI句子相似度任务中，表示紧凑3.4倍、鲁棒1.4倍，STSb分数略有下降。

Conclusion: 通过功能约束学习的鲁棒超紧凑表示为从边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景的关键挑战提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量化感知训练中FP阶段和QAT阶段计算资源的最优分配策略，以提高量化模型的准确性。

Method: 进行了广泛的实验，涵盖不同计算预算、QAT位宽和模型大小，提出了基于tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量的预测方法，并开发了冷却与QAT融合的新方法。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，提出的缩放定律能准确预测最优QAT比例和最终性能，融合方法显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用指导，能够在相同计算预算下训练出更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOAP优化算法在语言建模任务中表现出色，但理论分析表明其与Shampoo在Kronecker积假设下等价，实验显示三者收敛速度和最终损失无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从梯度白化角度分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，理解其预处理器作为白化矩阵近似的性质，并建立SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价关系。

Method: 通过理论分析建立SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker积假设下的等价性，并使用nanoGPT进行语言建模实验和灰度图像着色实验进行实证验证。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失方面与Adam和Shampoo相比没有显著优势，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP虽然在语言建模中表现良好，但与Shampoo在理论上等价，实践中三者性能相近，没有明显的算法优势。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行列方差，解决低比特量化中的异常值表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在≤4比特时出现困惑度下降，主要原因是异常值表示导致共享尺度的参数精度问题，这在无校准均匀量化中尤为明显。

Method: 在现有后训练量化器基础上增加第二轴尺度因子，使用快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法找到尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一量化代理目标。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上评估，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4困惑度，相比无校准均匀量化基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: SINQ方法无需层间交互，可轻松应用于新架构量化任何线性层，并能与校准和非均匀量化级别结合进一步增强效果。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分数据同化方法在海洋和大气预报中广泛应用，但涉及Hessian信息时计算成本高昂，需要更高效的求解方法。

Method: 使用元学习框架，通过傅里叶神经算子(FNO)近似反Hessian算子，为共轭梯度法提供初始化，形成FNO-CG方法。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的数值实验显示，FNO-CG方法相比标准CG方法，平均相对误差降低62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态条件下改进最显著。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法对具有挑战性的数据同化问题展现出鲁棒性和高效性，特别是在病态场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Conclusion: GDR学习器具有准预言机效率和速率双重稳健性，因此是渐近最优的，为潜在结果分布估计提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了将变分方法融入稀疏自编码器(SAE)是否能改善特征组织和可解释性。通过引入变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，发现虽然vSAE在特征独立性和消融指标上表现优异，但在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，主要原因是KL散度项产生了过度的正则化压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分方法是否能改善稀疏自编码器的特征组织和可解释性，假设概率采样能产生分散压力，使特征在潜在空间中更连贯地组织并避免重叠。

Method: 引入变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用从学习的高斯后验中随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，并加入朝向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。在Pythia-70M transformer残差流激活上评估Topk vSAE与标准TopK SAE。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，但在特征独立性和消融指标上表现优异。KL散度项导致过度正则化，显著减少了活跃特征的比例，导致性能下降。vSAE特征显示出更好的鲁棒性，但死特征数量远多于基线。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于SAE并不能改善特征组织或可解释性，需要更精细的方法来平衡正则化压力与特征质量。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS是一种轻量级SFT方法，可将单个MoE检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制表面，允许在推理时动态调整稀疏度k，无需更换模型或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏专家混合模型需要为不同稀疏度训练多个模型，增加了训练、维护成本和部署复杂性，限制了满足多样化延迟、效率和能耗需求的灵活性。

Method: 提出MoE-PHDS方法，通过跨稀疏度混合训练和高稀疏度短课程，将单个检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制表面，无需架构更改。

Result: 在多个模型上的实验表明，PHDS匹配或超过专用oracle模型，跨稀疏度一致性提升达22%，实现了简化的运行时MoE部署。

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS使全局稀疏度成为一等服务的原语，实现了从单一模型获得可预测的准确率/延迟权衡，简化了MoE的灵活部署。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Conclusion: 层论为拓扑深度学习提供了自然且原则性的框架，能够实现更表达性的高阶消息传递，论文还提供了从抽象到应用的层论自包含介绍。

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

TL;DR: 论文通过谱分析方法研究大语言模型训练过程中的几何表示演化，发现预训练中存在三个几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段和压缩寻求阶段，这些阶段与模型能力涌现相关。后训练方法会进一步改变表示几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标无法解释大语言模型复杂能力的涌现，需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型训练过程中的动态变化。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩和特征谱衰减，分析OLMo和Pythia模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现预训练中存在三个一致的几何阶段：表示坍缩、熵寻求和压缩寻求阶段。后训练方法如SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，而RLVR诱导压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 模型能力的涌现与表示几何的特定演化模式相关，这些模式源于交叉熵优化与表示瓶颈的基本相互作用，后训练方法会进一步塑造表示几何以适配特定目标。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Motivation: 灾难性干扰是机器学习中的基本挑战，训练模型在适应新任务时会逐渐丧失先前学习任务的能力。本文旨在从潜在表示学习角度更好地理解和建模这一问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用最大似然估计从PTA和ATA配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量。

Result: 理论和实证验证表明，识别和学习这些共享表示可以有效减轻机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰，在合成和基准数据集上都取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将灾难性干扰形式化为识别问题并识别共享潜在变量，本文提供了理论保证和实际性能改进，为解决灾难性遗忘问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要边缘智能，但联邦学习中参数共享存在数据重构风险，统一全局模型难以适应多样化的本地数据分布。

Method: 使用样本级表示进行知识共享，应用个性化DP策略抵抗重构攻击；开发隐私感知的神经架构搜索算法，生成本地定制化架构和超参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，相比PerFedRLNAS方法准确率提升6.82%，模型大小减少到1/10，通信成本降低到1/20。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对基于表示的联邦学习的个性化DP解决方案，具有理论收敛保证，在保护隐私的同时显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

TL;DR: 提出了GuardNet，一种分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越容易受到越狱攻击，这些攻击会绕过对齐约束并引发未经授权或有害行为，威胁LLM在医疗、金融等关键领域的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 构建结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力衍生标记关系的结构化图，使用图神经网络进行两级过滤：提示级过滤器检测全局对抗提示，标记级过滤器精确定位细粒度对抗片段。

Result: 在三个数据集和多种攻击设置下，GuardNet显著优于现有防御方法。提示级F1分数从66.4%提升到99.8%，标记级F1从48-75%提升到74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: 尽管结构复杂，GuardNet保持了可接受的延迟并在跨域评估中泛化良好，是实际部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

<details>

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和粗糙能量景观中混合缓慢，并行回火虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上生成整个自旋构型，作为Metropolis步骤中的全局提议，与单自旋翻转互补。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中重现磁化和自由能曲线，泛化到临界区域；在3D自旋玻璃优化中找到更低能量状态；在整数分解问题中成功泛化到未见过的半素数。

Conclusion: 神经网络提议可以系统性地加速蒙特卡洛方法，通过捕捉全局结构实现更快采样和更强的组合优化性能。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 在医疗等数据隐私至关重要的领域，联邦学习面临统计异质性挑战。本文受医疗场景启发：中央服务器能否不仅构建模型，还能指导新患者到最适合其病情的医院？

Method: 引入基于经验似然的框架，同时解决两个目标：(1)在每个客户端学习有效的本地模型，(2)为新查询找到最佳匹配的客户端。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实证结果表明，该框架在模型准确性和客户端指导精度方面均优于标准联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能、资源效率更高的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异质性作为特征而非缺陷加以利用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型往往过度依赖预训练中的语言先验，而未能充分利用视觉证据。传统输入-输出探测方法无法揭示视觉信息如何影响模型内部机制。

Method: 通过层间表示动态分析，识别视觉整合点(VIP)，并开发总视觉整合(TVI)估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响强度。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合(涵盖9个当代LVLM和6个基准测试)中，VIP现象普遍存在，且TVI能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该方法为诊断和理解LVLM中的语言先验提供了原则性工具包，揭示了视觉信息在模型内部整合的关键机制。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高、优化器无关，可轻松集成到ML实验跟踪平台，为学习率调度提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

### [242] [Signal Preserving Weight Initialization for Odd-Sigmoid Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23085)
*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对奇数S型激活函数类的初始化方法，通过选择适当的噪声尺度来避免前向激活的方差崩溃或饱和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不合适的初始化会导致饱和、方差崩溃和学习率敏感性增加，需要针对特定激活函数设计专门的初始化方法。

Method: 定义奇数S型激活函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出封闭形式的初始化方法，通过选择噪声尺度来确保前向激活在目标层之前保持良好分散。

Result: 该方法无需归一化层即可可靠训练，表现出强大的数据效率，并能在标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、正交）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数下实现学习。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化之间的依赖关系，为特定激活函数类提供了有效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

### [243] [Unleashing Flow Policies with Distributional Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23087)
*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Flow Critic (DFC)，一种新的评论家架构，通过学习完整的状态-动作回报分布来提升基于流的策略在离线强化学习中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的策略在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其潜力受到传统评论家仅学习单一标量期望回报的限制，无法充分利用策略的表达能力。

Method: DFC使用流匹配技术，将回报分布建模为从简单基分布到复杂目标回报分布的连续灵活变换，而不是回归到单一值。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中，该方法实现了强大的性能，特别是在需要多模态动作分布的任务上，在离线和离线到在线微调方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFC通过提供丰富的分布式贝尔曼目标，为表达性流策略提供了更稳定和信息丰富的学习信号，突破了传统评论家的瓶颈。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对网络基础模型(NFMs)的潜在知识进行系统性调查，通过嵌入几何分析、度量对齐评估和因果敏感性测试三个维度评估模型，发现现有模型存在显著各向异性、不一致特征敏感性等问题，解决这些问题可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而缺乏对网络基础模型内部潜在知识的系统性分析。本文旨在通过分析隐藏表示来深入理解这些模型编码的知识。

Method: 采用三部分评估方法：嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用，度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的一致性，因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用五个不同网络数据集评估四个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 发现所有模型都表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖性等问题。解决这些限制可显著提升模型性能(最高提升0.35 F1分数且无需架构改变)。

Conclusion: 当前网络基础模型在表示学习方面存在系统性限制，通过识别和解决这些限制可以显著改进模型性能，为未来NFMs的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

*Christopher Scarvelis,Justin Solomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种计算扩散模型对训练数据微小扰动的敏感性的方法，无需重新训练即可预测模型样本的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性，以便在投入昂贵的重新训练之前预测模型样本的变化。

Method: 开发了一种闭式程序来计算从数据分布到最优评分函数映射的方向导数，仅需预训练评分模型及其对输入的导数的黑盒访问。

Result: 该方法能够估计扩散模型样本对目标测度加性扰动的敏感性，运行时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径的对数似然相当。

Conclusion: 该方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，得到的敏感性与图像扩散模型在重新训练和微调后样本的变化相关。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-PO是一个增强策略优化的奖励塑造框架，通过引入因果连贯性代理来减少LLMs的奖励黑客行为和虚假推理，提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，将正确输出与虚假或不忠实的推理配对，并在小因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: CE-PO使用基于雅可比矩阵的敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实硬化抑制干扰线索，并通过Minkowski组合器将连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验结果显示，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确率（最高达9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO有效减少了奖励黑客行为和虚假思维链推理，在保持近似准确性的同时显著提高了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成图神经网络框架，结合GCN、GAT和GIN模型，用于区块链欺诈检测，在保持低误报率的同时提高非法交易召回率，并设计了量子就绪架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链的匿名性为非法活动创造了机会，现有反洗钱检测方法难以同时捕捉结构和时间依赖关系，且对噪声、不平衡和对抗行为不够鲁棒。

Method: 使用软投票集成框架整合GCN、GAT和GIN三种图神经网络模型，在真实Elliptic数据集上进行训练和调优。

Result: 优化的软投票集成在保持误报率低于1%的同时，实现了对非法交易的高召回率，优于单个GNN模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 集成GNN为实时加密货币监控提供了实用且前瞻的解决方案，既具有即时反洗钱效用，又为量子增强金融安全分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持Muon优化器性能的同时将内存占用减少约74%，在LLM预训练中优于AdamW和8位AdamW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和2倍计算效率，但像AdamW一样是有状态的，需要存储模型权重和累积梯度。现有的8位AdamW变体虽然通过分块量化减轻了内存开销，但通常只在动态量化下稳定。

Method: 开发了基于分块量化的8位Muon优化器，支持线性和动态两种量化方案，并通过理论分析解释了其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 8位Muon在1.6B模型预训练中性能接近全精度Muon，优于AdamW和8位AdamW；在Llama 3.2 3B模型微调中也表现出竞争力；内存占用比全精度Muon减少约74%。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在保持Muon优化器优势的同时显著减少了内存需求，为大规模模型训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

TL;DR: RHYTHM是一个基于大语言模型的人类移动预测框架，通过时间标记化和分层注意力机制处理复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，需要更有效的建模方法。

Method: 使用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，采用分层注意力捕获日和周依赖，结合预计算提示嵌入来丰富表示，并冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算成本。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，RHYTHM相比现有方法实现了2.4%的整体准确率提升，周末准确率提高5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM证明了LLM作为通用时空预测器和轨迹推理器的有效性，在人类移动预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

*Dengyi Liu,Honggang Wang,Hua Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Impute-MACFM，一种用于表格数据插补的掩码感知条件流匹配框架，能处理随机缺失、随机缺失和非随机缺失机制，在多种基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在医疗等应用中很常见，但缺失值问题普遍存在，会降低模型保真度和可靠性。现有插补方法要么假设限制性强，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而最近的生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用掩码感知条件流匹配框架，仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时对观测条目施加稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入。推理时使用约束保持的常微分方程积分，可选多轨迹聚合以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的性能，相比竞争方法提供更鲁棒、高效和高质量的插补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配是处理表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）的一个有前景的方向，Impute-MACFM为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）在开发推理模型时存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了自感知推理模型的实现。

Method: 提出组序列策略梯度（GSPG）框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，应用交叉熵正则器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。对于二元奖励，置信度校准正则器和GSPG具有协作性；对于非二元奖励，应用非线性奖励归一化和自适应正则器裁剪。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中对大型语言模型进行后训练，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG是一种简单有效的置信度校准方法，能同时提升推理性能并抑制过度自信，为开发自感知推理模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

Motivation: 解决逆强化学习中对抗性方法训练不稳定，以及非对抗性方法缺乏理论保证的问题

Method: 提出TRRO框架，通过最大化专家行为似然（等价于最小化期望回报差距），并实例化为PIRO算法

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，在奖励恢复、策略模仿和样本效率方面达到或超越最先进基线

Conclusion: TRRO为IRL提供了类似TRPO的稳定性理论保证，PIRO算法在实践中表现出色且稳定

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiINR是一个统一的框架，将INR配置制定为严格的优化问题，通过贝叶斯优化高效探索离散激活函数族和连续初始化参数的联合空间，取代了手动调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR的有效性受到缺乏原则性配置策略的限制，包括激活函数选择、初始化尺度、层间适应等，这些选择影响性能、稳定性和泛化能力，但现有方法依赖临时启发式或网格搜索，导致跨模态结果不一致。

Method: 利用贝叶斯优化，OptiINR高效探索离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）及其相关连续初始化参数的联合空间，实现系统化的数据驱动优化过程。

Result: OptiINR通过提供全局最优配置，为INR设计建立了原则性基础，在多样信号处理应用中持续最大化性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR取代了分散的手动调优，提供了一个连贯的、数据驱动的优化过程，为INR配置提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，将键值对重新构想为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家以捕捉长期依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键挑战：固有滞后效应（历史时间戳相关性动态变化）和异常段（引入噪声信号降低预测精度）。

Method: 提出TMOE注意力机制，将键值对视为局部专家，为每个查询进行自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家。在PatchTST和Timer框架中替换普通注意力机制，分别得到TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G。

Result: 在7个真实世界长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，在保持Transformer长期依赖捕捉能力的同时实现了更好的预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型选择方法往往无法识别少数但正确的答案，限制了其超越简单多数投票的效果，这源于验证器训练中缺乏信息性批判信号。

Method: 使用小型指令调优模型通过拒绝采样合成高质量批判数据，对比模型生成解与真实解，利用RLVR过程冷启动LLM，生成多个批判并聚合为验证分数。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号有效提升了LLM的推理性能和诚实性，超越了传统的多数投票方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

TL;DR: CrystalGym是一个用于晶体材料发现的开源强化学习环境，通过直接使用DFT计算作为反馈信号，为材料设计提供基准测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法大多使用生成方法而无法直接利用DFT信号进行训练，主要因为DFT计算成本高昂。为了在材料设计循环中引入直接DFT信号，需要开发相应的强化学习环境。

Method: 提出CrystalGym强化学习环境，使用DFT直接计算能带隙、体模量和密度等属性作为奖励信号，对常见的基于价值和策略的强化学习算法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明不同算法在不同环境设置下具有不同的样本效率和收敛到最优解的能力，但没有一个算法能解决所有CrystalGym任务。

Conclusion: CrystalGym为强化学习研究者和材料科学家提供了一个解决现实世界设计问题的测试平台，为处理耗时奖励信号的强化学习方法开辟了新挑战领域。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

TL;DR: 使用LSTM模型从智能手机被动感知数据中检测老年人认知障碍，通过日常行为序列分析和两种泛化技术（常规感知增强和人口统计个性化）显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床评估频率低、敏感性不足，难以捕捉老年人细微的认知衰退。被动智能手机感知为自然连续认知监测提供了有前景的方法。

Method: 基于LSTM模型，从多模态感知数据中提取日常行为特征序列，采用两种技术增强模型泛化能力：常规感知增强（生成行为相似日期的合成序列）和人口统计个性化（重新加权训练样本以强调与测试参与者人口统计相似的个体）。

Result: 在36名老年人6个月数据上的评估显示，这两种技术联合使用将模型在感知和人口统计特征上的AUPRC从0.637提升到0.766。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了利用被动感知技术对老年人群认知障碍进行可扩展监测的潜力。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供多层次可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型只能提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式。

Method: ProtoTS基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，通过分层组织原型来捕获全局时间模式和局部细粒度变化。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试中，ProtoTS不仅预测精度超过现有方法，还提供专家可引导的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoTS在保持高预测精度的同时，实现了透明决策和多层次可解释性，为模型理解和决策支持提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆模型仅限于向量表示，需要扩展到概率分布以处理更复杂的分布数据。

Method: 定义基于存储分布的log-sum-exp能量函数，使用最优传输映射的Gibbs加权聚合进行检索动态。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型。

Conclusion: 将关联记忆从向量提升到完整分布，连接了经典DAM与现代生成建模，实现了记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了参数高效微调（PEFT）在科学机器学习中的应用，发现适配器调优比LoRA在大型算子模型上表现更好，并提出了基于频谱复杂度的频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），在多个3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习中尚未探索，该领域的目标是建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 1. 系统比较LoRA和适配器在大型算子模型上的性能；2. 理论分析LoRA在傅里叶层中的近似误差；3. 提出频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量。

Result: 适配器调优在大型算子模型上显著优于LoRA；F-Adapter在多个3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中建立了最先进结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中参数高效微调的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域的有效范式。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam是一种高效的非对称孪生架构，通过非对称发散对齐防止测试时熵最小化中的崩溃问题，在视觉适应和大型语言模型推理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时熵最小化虽然能帮助模型适应新环境并提升推理能力，但纯熵最小化可能导致模型选择非泛化性的捷径，如通过膨胀logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别来减少熵，从而产生崩溃解。

Method: 提出ZeroSiam非对称孪生架构，通过可学习预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作实现高效的非对称发散对齐，防止崩溃解。

Result: 实验和理论证明ZeroSiam不仅能防止崩溃解，还能吸收和规范化有偏学习信号，在挑战性测试场景和多样化模型中表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam在测试时熵最小化中有效防止崩溃，提升模型性能，适用于视觉适应和大型语言模型推理任务，对易崩溃的小型模型尤其有效。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临恶意客户端攻击和激励参与者贡献高质量数据的挑战，需要在严格隐私要求下解决这些问题。

Method: 使用主动警报机制和鲁棒聚合防御拜占庭和推理攻击，采用Tullock竞赛启发式激励机制奖励诚实客户端，将服务器与客户端交互建模为两阶段Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 实验结果表明CoSIFL在标准基准测试中优于现有解决方案，提高了模型鲁棒性并降低了总服务器成本。

Conclusion: CoSIFL的集成设计有效解决了联邦学习中的安全性和激励问题，证明了博弈论方法在此领域的实用性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究了MXFP4和NVFP4两种4位浮点格式在LLM后训练量化中的实际表现，揭示了其性能差距，并提出MR-GPTQ方法通过块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来提升FP4量化精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式(MXFP4和NVFP4)承诺革新LLM推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证，需要研究如何克服传统方法在FP4量化中的局限性。

Method: 提出Micro-Rotated-GPTQ(MR-GPTQ)方法，采用块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化，并开发高性能GPU内核通过权重旋转融合和快速在线激活计算来实现高效推理。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现层间3.6倍、端到端2.2倍加速，在RTX5090上实现层间6倍、端到端4倍加速，显著提升MXFP4精度至接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但像MR-GPTQ这样的格式专门化方法能够解锁精度与性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICRL方法在测试时无法像训练数据那样持续改进性能，存在上下文模糊性问题——模型自身的随机动作可能生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史，导致恶性循环。

Method: 提出CV-ICRL，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时理论上可达到的理想性能。随着上下文扩展，上下文价值应非递减。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降，并在各种任务和环境中提升了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: CV-ICRL通过上下文价值解决了ICRL中的上下文模糊性问题，为单调改进提供了理论保证，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to

Conclusion: 无线数学问题具有可验证正确性的独特属性，使得无需人工反馈的有效强化学习成为可能。紧凑模型通过领域特定训练可以匹配或超越大型模型，并展现出正向迁移能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and

TL;DR: SPEC-RL通过将推测解码与RL rollout过程集成，利用先前轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展，减少冗余生成，在保持策略质量的同时将rollout时间减少2-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地依赖带可验证奖励的强化学习来引发可靠的思维链推理，但训练过程仍受限于计算成本高昂的rollout阶段。现有加速方法存在收益递减、引入偏差或忽略迭代间冗余的问题。

Method: 提出SPEC-RL框架，将推测解码与RL rollout过程集成，重用先前轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯rollout阶段增强方法，可与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

### [269] [Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246)
*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ATDP方法，通过自适应地对敏感token梯度施加更大噪声，显著减少DP训练时间，在保护敏感信息的同时保持模型在非敏感数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPSGD方法对所有梯度均匀注入噪声，导致训练时间显著延长且模型准确性下降，需要更高效的隐私保护方法。

Method: ATDP修改标准DP-SGD，自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，仅需少量轻量级后处理。

Result: ATDP将DP微调计算开销减少约90%，训练时间大幅缩短，同时实现可比或更优的隐私保护效果，模型准确性仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: ATDP提供了一种高效的隐私保护方案，可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，显著降低计算成本同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的高维参数空间子空间回归方法，通过预测更大维度的子空间来降低学习复杂度并提高精度，应用于参数化偏微分方程求解等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化降阶模型在离线阶段计算选定参数子空间，在线阶段通过插值近似未知参数子空间，但高维参数空间使经典插值策略不可行或不可靠。

Method: 将插值问题松弛为回归问题，引入适用于子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络近似高维目标函数，通过预测更大维度子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，使Grassmann流形上的光滑映射更平滑，实证结果显示预测更大子空间显著提高精度。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数偏微分方程求解等任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical

Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future

Conclusion: ABCONFORMER能够仅从序列准确预测抗体-抗原相互作用界面，为疫苗设计和抗体开发提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Conclusion: 研究表明，在PREDICT v3相关信息缺失或可能存在数据集偏移的情况下，迁移学习、从头随机生存森林和集成方法能够改善乳腺癌的预后预测。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Result: 在200个随机市场情景中评估，该方法在所有替代策略中获得了更高的平均奖励，具有快速的初始收益和持续的优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法的优越性并非来自复杂神经网络或改进的参数估计，而是通过直接学习最优ALM策略而不学习环境实现的。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Motivation: 不规则多元时间序列在医疗和金融等领域普遍存在，但异步采样和不规则间隔给现有方法带来两大挑战：如何准确表示原始信息而不引入数据失真，以及如何有效捕获观测点间的复杂动态依赖关系

Method: ASTGI框架包含四个模块：时空点表示模块将离散观测编码为可学习嵌入空间中的点；邻域自适应图构建模块通过最近邻搜索为每个点自适应构建因果图；时空动态传播模块基于点间相对时空位置生成消息并计算交互权重来迭代更新信息；基于查询点的预测模块通过聚合邻域信息进行回归预测

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ASTGI优于各种最先进的方法

Conclusion: ASTGI框架有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的关键挑战，在准确表示原始信息和捕获复杂动态依赖关系方面表现出色

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 循环深度Transformer的迭代过程具有两尺度几何特性，基于二阶步长差异的早退机制是更优的计算效率优化策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical

remaining highly efficient.

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在数据流形上进行黎曼优化的方法，通过链接函数将数据分布与几何操作连接起来，利用扩散模型的分数函数来恢复流形操作，并开发了两种高效推理算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维数据集中在低维流形的假设下，解决当流形仅通过数据分布隐式给出且缺乏标准流形操作时，如何进行黎曼优化的问题，这对现代生成AI中的数据驱动设计至关重要。

Method: 引入链接函数连接数据分布与几何操作，利用扩散模型的分数函数恢复流形操作（如回缩和黎曼梯度计算），提出了DLF和DRGD两种推理算法。

Result: 建立了与扩散模型分数函数的直接联系，能够利用预训练分数网络进行优化，理论保证了算法的可行性和最优性。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据驱动控制中的有限时域参考跟踪任务中表现出有效性，展示了在生成和设计应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

TL;DR: 本文理论分析了连续思维链(continuous CoT)在训练过程中如何自然学习叠加机制，揭示了两阶段训练动态：思维生成阶段和预测阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补连续CoT叠加机制如何从基于梯度的训练方法中自然学习的理论空白，理解Transformer模型在解决有向图可达性问题时的训练动态。

Method: 理论分析简化双层Transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，跟踪索引匹配logit的增长过程，并通过实验验证理论。

Result: 发现索引匹配logit在训练过程中先增加后保持有界，这种有界性有效平衡了推理过程中的探索与利用，导致叠加机制的自然出现。

Conclusion: 连续CoT训练过程中，有界的索引匹配logit促使模型在不确定时对多个搜索轨迹赋予可比权重，从而自然形成叠加推理机制。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

*Ange-Clément Akazan,Verlon Roel Mbingui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出并评估了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，包括KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO四种选择器，在多个分类和回归表格数据集基准测试中与传统方法进行比较，结果显示KAN方法具有竞争力且有时更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。KANs通过样条参数化特征变换，能够直接获取可解释的重要性度量。

Method: 引入四种基于KAN的特征选择器（KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO），并与经典基线方法（LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE）在多个分类和回归表格数据集上进行比较。

Result: KAN选择器在结构化和合成数据集中与传统方法竞争且有时更优。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归数据集和异构数据集上表现稳健，在分类任务中KAN选择器有时通过消除冗余而超越其他方法。

Conclusion: 基于KAN的特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

TL;DR: 提出了图一致性正则化(GCR)框架，通过将模型预测生成的关系图结构注入学习过程，促进类感知的语义特征表示。该方法作为自提示机制，让模型利用自身输出来优化内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示往往包含噪声的类间相似性，与模型预测的语义相矛盾。需要一种方法来确保特征级关系反映类一致的预测行为。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数免费的图一致性层(GCLs)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐。通过自适应权重学习层重要性，优先考虑语义可靠的层并抑制噪声层。

Result: GCR在各种网络和数据集上促进了更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和改进的泛化能力，无需修改架构或训练过程。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构中学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的方法，能够有效提升语义结构质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，通过改进离散扩散模型的训练目标来解决训练时均匀随机去噪与推理时规划去噪路径之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过灵活的并行生成路径实现了快速推理，但规划器引入的非均匀去噪路径与训练时的均匀随机路径不匹配，导致标准训练目标无法准确描述规划器下的去噪器。

Method: 推导了新的Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO)，将基于规划器的反向动态直接纳入训练目标，提出了PAPL方法对标准掩码离散扩散损失进行简单有效的修改。

Result: PAPL在不同领域均带来一致改进：蛋白质序列建模相对增益40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升高达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对增益23%。

Conclusion: 通过将规划器感知的路径学习纳入训练目标，PAPL有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，显著提升了扩散语言模型在多个领域的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个多路图链接预测框架，将问题构建为多视图边分类，使用跨层自注意力融合不同层的证据，并引入了可扩展且无泄漏的评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么合并图层要么独立处理图层，这会丢失关键的层间依赖关系且难以扩展。需要一种能够有效融合多层信息并保持可扩展性的方法。

Method: 将多路链接预测构建为多视图边分类，为每个节点对构建每层边视图序列，应用跨层自注意力融合目标层证据。提出了Trans-SLE（基于静态嵌入的轻量转换器）和Trans-GAT（结合层特定GAT编码器与转换器融合）两个模型实例。

Result: 在六个公共多路数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）实现了持续的macro-F1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，通过跨层自注意力有效融合多路图信息。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH是一种混合稀疏性框架，通过在权重矩阵中结合密集块和2:4稀疏块，实现0%-50%的连续稀疏比，在保持模型精度的同时获得实际加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持精度但无法GPU加速，而半结构化2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡精度与加速的方法。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持跨层非均匀稀疏分布。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的精度差距，同时实现实际加速。在LLaMA-2 7B上获得1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，精度比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM提升0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功平衡了模型精度与加速需求，为大型语言模型部署提供了有效的稀疏化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

Motivation: 现有神经求解器依赖预定义问题约束或需要针对每个问题进行微调，这严重限制了它们对未见VRP变种的零样本泛化能力。

Method: 提出统一数据表示(UDR)替代问题枚举，开发混合偏置模块(MBM)学习几何和关系偏置，使用参数生成器自适应调整解码器和偏置权重，并采用LLM驱动的约束满足机制。

Result: URS能够在零样本情况下为100多种不同的VRP变种（包括90多种未见变种）持续产生高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: URS是首个能够使用单一模型处理超过100种VRP变种的神经求解器，实现了显著的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具备线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射视为查询和键之间的传输计划，并使用低秩约束来优化计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了Transformer在长上下文窗口中的扩展。同时，大多数注意力机制会产生行归一化映射，可能导致过度关注少数token，影响鲁棒性和信息流动。

Method: 利用注意力映射与查询-键传输计划之间的联系，通过约束传输计划为低秩来实现双重随机性。具体通过求解两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键），并将它们组合成条件耦合，形成秩最多为r≪n的注意力矩阵。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到最先进的结果，在准确性和效率上都超过了先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的注意力机制，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，有效解决了标准注意力机制的可扩展性和鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hessian近似质量对影响函数数据归因性能的影响，发现在分类任务中更好的Hessian近似确实能带来更好的影响分数质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响函数提供了一种追溯模型预测到训练数据的理论方法，但在深度学习中应用困难，因为需要求逆大型、病态的Hessian矩阵。现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC被提出，但不清楚这些近似对数据归因性能的影响程度。

Method: 在受控分类设置下研究Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因的影响，分解最近Hessian近似方法的各个步骤，并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明更好的Hessian近似一致地产生更好的影响分数质量。K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值之间的不匹配占据了大部分误差和影响损失。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了哪些近似最为关键，为未来在计算可行性和归因准确性之间取得平衡的努力提供了指导。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规合规要求在模型训练中移除敏感数据，但这一过程常导致分布偏移，特别是在分布外场景下严重损害模型性能。

Method: 引入判别保持因子去相关模块（动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新）减少特征冗余和最小化特征间相关性，以及带损失扰动的平滑数据移除机制，创建信息论保护防止数据泄露。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于其他基线方法，即使在显著分布偏移下也能持续实现高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景下均表现出卓越的效率和适应性，为隐私保护模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 大规模数值模拟计算成本高昂，现有AI替代模型在关键任务应用中存在物理合理性、可信度和异构数据融合的局限性。

Method: PHASE框架结合了异构输入的数据类型感知编码器和从局部动力学到全局系统行为的多级物理约束，确保物理一致性。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These

*Ziheng Cheng,Zhong Li,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Evolved Sampling (ES)框架，通过动态采样和损失差异分析来加速训练过程，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据选择旨在加速学习过程并保持性能，核心思想是识别对训练有显著贡献的信息丰富数据样本。

Method: ES框架基于损失动态和增强损失差异进行批次级数据选择，支持灵活的频率调整，并可扩展为包含集合级数据选择的ESWP方法。

Result: 作为即插即用框架，ES(WP)在各种预训练和后训练任务中实现无损训练加速，节省高达近45%的挂钟时间。

Conclusion: 研究结果激励进一步探索现代大规模机器学习的数据效率方面。

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

*Alakh Sharma,Gaurish Trivedi,Kartikey Bhandari,Yash Sinha,Dhruv Kumar,Pratik Narang,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEMS是一个替代PSRO的生成式进化元求解器，通过潜在锚点和摊销生成器取代显式策略种群，使用蒙特卡洛模拟和元动态方法，在保持博弈论保证的同时实现6倍速度提升和1.3倍内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于种群的MARL方法（如PSRO）需要存储显式策略种群和构建完整收益矩阵，导致二次计算和线性内存成本，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用紧凑潜在锚点集和单个摊销生成器替代显式种群；通过无偏蒙特卡洛模拟、乘法权重元动态和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集；在生成器内使用基于优势的信任域目标训练最佳响应。

Result: 在双人和多人游戏中，GEMS比PSRO快约6倍，内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时克服了其基本低效问题，实现了多个领域的可扩展多智能体学习。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出了POC框架，通过结合近端策略优化和变点检测，在实时操作中智能决定何时重新求解MILP优化问题，平衡性能与计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时操作中需要频繁求解计算密集的MILP问题，但重新求解成本高昂。现有方法多为启发式，缺乏对常见NP难MILP问题的系统性解决方案。

Method: 结合近端策略优化(PPO)和变点检测，建立重新求解次数与成本的关系模型，在环境变化时选择有益样本进行求解。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上测试，POC框架比现有基线方法性能提升2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架为实时MILP问题提供了有效的重新求解决策方案，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试的空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter是一种轻量级可学习转换层，通过在旧版和新版嵌入空间之间建立映射，避免生产向量数据库升级时重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，显著降低操作中断和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库并重建ANN索引，导致严重的操作中断和高昂计算成本。需要一种更高效的方法来管理模型版本间的嵌入空间漂移。

Method: 提出Drift-Adapter转换层，系统评估三种参数化方法：正交Procrustes、低秩仿射变换和紧凑残差MLP，使用少量新旧嵌入对进行训练，将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料和CLIP图像模型升级（100万项目）实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率（Recall@10, MRR），仅增加不到10微秒查询延迟，相比完全重新索引减少100倍以上的重新计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter作为一种实用解决方案，能够以接近零操作中断的方式促进敏捷模型部署，在模型漂移、训练数据大小、可扩展性等方面表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LoRAct的内存高效微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩显著减少内存消耗，在保持性能的同时将激活内存降低约80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的发展，参数高效微调范式受到广泛关注。虽然已有许多方法减少可训练参数数量，但它们的内存开销仍然是阻碍实际部署的关键瓶颈。研究发现模型激活是内存消耗的主要来源，特别是在大批量和长上下文长度下，但激活的秩始终保持较低水平。

Method: 提出LoRAct方法，提供更灵活和通用的压缩策略，可以在前向传播过程中在线应用，无需任何校准数据。该方法包含一种新颖的基于采样的正交分解算法，专门针对低秩矩阵设计，相比广泛使用的RSVD具有更好的计算效率和更紧的误差界。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验证明了LoRAct的有效性。与广泛采用的LoRA方法相比，LoRAct进一步将激活内存减少了约80%，同时保持了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAct是一种高效的内存优化微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩有效解决了参数高效微调中的内存瓶颈问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文在Barron框架下分析了群不变神经网络的泛化误差，发现群不变结构引入了一个群相关因子δ≤1，当δ较小时能显著提升逼近精度，且估计误差不受影响，从而在目标函数具有群对称性时能显著改善泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络在对称目标函数学习中的统计优势，为编码对称性结构提供理论依据。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的逼近误差和Rademacher复杂度，通过群相关因子δ量化对称性带来的影响。

Result: 群不变结构引入δ≤1的因子改善逼近误差，而Rademacher复杂度不增加，因此在对称目标函数下泛化误差显著改善。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构为神经网络在对称目标函数学习中提供了明确的统计优势，理论结果支持了对称性编码的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器学习模型在仅依赖过去数据时能否有效泛化到未来分布变化的情况，比较了参数插值和参数外推两种方法，发现在各种时序任务中，这些方法都无法稳定优于直接使用最新模型参数的简单基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布变化下性能往往下降，作者想探究仅基于过去数据时，模型是否以及如何能够有效泛化到未来数据。

Method: 研究了两种主要方法：参数插值（过去模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超出过去参数凸包的显式外推），在多个时序任务上进行了基准测试。

Result: 在所有评估场景中，没有任何方法能够一致地优于直接使用最新可用模型参数的简单基线。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据或对数据生成过程的稳健假设时，泛化和外推到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，CRIB在高缺失率下仍能准确预测

Conclusion: CRIB通过直接从不完整数据预测，避免了插补误差，提供了更可靠的多元时间序列预测解决方案

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新优化器的流行和模型量化成为高效部署的标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能，填补当前对优化器-量化交互作用缺乏系统证据的空白。

Method: 首先训练50M到1.5B参数的全精度模型，使用六种优化器探索超参数空间并建立基准；然后应用PTQ评估不同优化器训练模型的性能退化；最后研究QAT退化，从头训练量化模型并与原始精度基准比较。

Result: 发现异常值相关指标（如MMR和峰度）无法预测不同优化器的PTQ性能；在QAT中，原始预训练表现好的优化器不一定在量化训练中保持最优，Shampoo优化器显示出最低的精度退化。

Conclusion: 推导了不同优化器下量化感知训练的缩放规律，表明Shampoo在所有测试优化器中实现了最高的参数效率，为优化器选择提供了量化鲁棒性方面的指导。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Conclusion: 所提出的IDMVAE模型通过互信息正则化和扩散先验，有效解决了多模态表示学习中的信息分离问题，在生成质量和语义保持方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Motivation: 当前基因组序列分析方法存在局限性：标准机器学习模型忽略SNP的序列上下文，而Transformer等序列模型对中等规模数据集计算成本过高。

Method: 开发轻量级自定义1D CNN从高维SNP数据中学习预测性序列模式，与擅长捕获复杂特征交互的XGBoost模型集成。

Result: 在809株E. coli菌株数据集上，对4种抗生素预测表现优异：CIP的MCC达0.926，GEN的Macro F1-score达0.691，模型能正确聚焦于已知耐药基因的SNP。

Conclusion: 融合序列感知1D CNN和基于特征的XGBoost模型创建了强大的集成方法，克服了单独使用无序特征模型或序列模型的局限性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Motivation: 传统约束方法如PC假设完美CI测试和穷举搜索，实践中常违反假设导致级联错误；现有LLM方法假设完美专家，但LLM存在幻觉问题。

Method: 从CI测试和LLM标注生成高置信度种子，使用混洗查询过滤幻觉，采用置信度下降传播策略优先定向最可靠边。

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD在最终图构建中比现有约束方法获得更高精度。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过改进初始种子可靠性和鲁棒传播策略，有效提升了因果发现的准确性。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

Motivation: 解决现有XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间的权衡问题，以及LRP实现中依赖启发式规则集而未针对清晰度或模型行为对齐进行优化的问题。

Method: 应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来调整LRP超参数，基于定量的可解释性指标(如忠实度或稀疏度)进行优化。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征具有强敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过原则性的任务特定优化可以系统性地提升归因质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

### [309] [Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592)
*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个全流程的持续模型融合框架，在融合前、融合中和融合后三个阶段进行干预，解决持续学习中的可扩展性和功能信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每领域任务向量导致可扩展性问题，要么在无法访问旧数据时仅依赖权重空间融合而丢失关键功能信息。

Method: 在融合前在切线空间中微调主模型以增强任务权重解耦；融合中利用优化器状态的功能信息；融合后通过校正对齐表示差异。

Result: 在标准类增量学习和领域增量学习基准测试中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了竞争性性能，还为灾难性遗忘问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，同时在不访问历史数据的情况下保持恒定内存约束。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

*Zekun Wang,Anant Gupta,Zihan Dong,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种针对扩散模型的秩1 EWC方法，结合回放机制，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法存在局限：回放方法需要强生成器且易发生分布漂移，EWC方法假设任务间共享最优解且通常使用对角Fisher近似。扩散模型已能生成高质量回放数据，但其梯度几何特性未被充分利用。

Method: 研究扩散模型在低信噪比下的梯度几何特性，发现样本梯度高度共线，经验Fisher矩阵近似秩1。提出秩1 EWC变体，成本与对角近似相同但能捕捉主要曲率方向，并与回放方法结合。

Result: 在类别增量图像生成任务上（MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10、ImageNet-1k），相比仅使用回放和对角EWC基线，平均FID显著改善，遗忘大幅减少。MNIST和FashionMNIST上遗忘几乎消除，ImageNet-1k上遗忘减半。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩1的Fisher矩阵，通过改进的Fisher估计，EWC成为回放方法的有效补充：回放促进任务间参数共享，EWC有效约束回放引起的漂移。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Conclusion: 将线性系统的经典理论与现代学习技术相结合，有望构建鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的时间序列预测模型。

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Conclusion: GraphIFE通过图不变特征提取有效解决了图数据中的类别不平衡问题，特别是合成节点质量不一致的挑战，展现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了DRIK方法，通过3x3分区解决传统2x2分区中的信息泄露问题，并在节点、边和子图三个层面增强归纳克里金法的分布外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统归纳克里金法的训练评估设置存在信息泄露问题，且分布外泛化能力较差，无法反映真实应用场景。

Method: 提出3x3分区方法消除信息泄露，并设计DRIK方法在节点层面扰动坐标捕捉空间关系，边层面丢弃边减少信息流模糊性，子图层面添加伪标签子图增强领域泛化。

Result: 在六个时空数据集上的实验表明，DRIK方法持续优于现有方法，MAE降低达12.48%，同时保持强可扩展性。

Conclusion: DRIK方法通过重新定义评估设置和引入多层面增强策略，显著提升了归纳克里金法的分布外泛化性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Conclusion: VN-HGCN通过虚拟节点机制成功解决了异构图学习中长距离信息捕获的挑战，仅需少量层数即可实现高效信息聚合，具有良好的通用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

Method: 提出理论分析参考模型如何约束对齐目标，通过可控高斯混合实验验证，并在SmolLM2系列模型上实施Align->KD流程。

Result: Align->KD流程能稳健对齐目标行为，获得更优的奖励和目标精度，而KD->Align流程则表现较差。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回能力是对齐的一阶设计选择，对齐必须在蒸馏之前进行。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明DIMIGNN持续优于现有方法

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过解决邻居信息冗余和单尺度预测限制，显著提升了多元时间序列预测性能

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

TL;DR: 提出了针对MoE模型的专用缩放定律，通过系统分解识别了5个关键影响因素，并构建了考虑所有必要因素的综合联合MoE缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集模型的缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为存在三个关键挑战：影响因素多样性、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响，需要细粒度的MoE专用缩放定律研究。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计了446个对照实验来表征它们的边际效应。

Result: 构建了全面精确的联合MoE缩放定律，推导出G、S和Na/N的理论最优和实际效率感知最优配置，发现G和S的最优设置独立于模型架构和数据大小，随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比Na/N变得更稀疏。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE缩放定律可以作为准确且具有洞察力的指导，促进未来MoE模型的设计和训练。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的动态合作联邦持续学习框架，通过动态联盟形成和选择性合作来解决异构环境下的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦持续学习中新任务引入时间和跨客户端偏移，导致灾难性遗忘。现有方法将客户端知识聚合到全局模型可能引入不相关知识的干扰，特别是在异构场景下。去中心化方法在任务变化时难以形成有效群体。

Method: 使用去中心化动态合作框架，客户端建立动态合作学习联盟来平衡新知识获取和先前学习保留。通过联盟亲和博弈模拟客户端关系，评估梯度一致性和模型相似性来量化合作收益，提出合并阻塞算法和动态合作进化算法实现合作动态平衡。

Result: 综合实验证明该方法优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的动态合作框架能有效解决联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在异构环境下实现个性化模型学习。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Method: 使用联盟博弈论框架，将神经元视为享乐博弈中的智能体，通过PAC-Top-Cover算法提取稳定神经元联盟，追踪跨层转换

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排器上应用，发现比聚类基线具有更高协同性的联盟，揭示了超越解缠结的高阶结构

Conclusion: 享乐联盟通过揭示神经元协作编码特征的方式，提供了功能重要、可解释且跨领域预测的计算单元

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在联邦学习中集成领域对抗神经网络的方法，通过近端正则化稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决医学影像中的扫描器诱导领域偏移问题，同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域受严格隐私法规限制，禁止原始数据共享。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但面临扫描器诱导的领域偏移问题，即不同硬件或采集协议导致的模型泛化失败。现有方法大多需要跨站点数据比较，与联邦学习的隐私约束冲突。

Method: 将领域对抗神经网络集成到联邦学习过程中，发现简单的联邦DANN无法收敛后，提出了近端正则化方法来稳定客户端间的对抗训练。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集的T1加权3D脑部MRI上进行实验，训练集包含15个站点，验证集包含19个未见站点。结果表明该方法在跨站点泛化性能上优于FedAvg和ERM，同时保持了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了医学影像联邦学习中的领域偏移问题，实现了更好的跨站点泛化性能，同时严格遵守隐私保护要求。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 研究模型合并对对抗样本迁移性的影响，挑战模型合并能提供免费对抗鲁棒性的普遍观点。

Method: 使用8种模型合并方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，在336种不同的攻击设置下进行综合评估和统计分析。

Result: 模型合并无法可靠防御迁移攻击，相对迁移攻击成功率超过95%。更强的模型合并方法会增加对迁移攻击的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 模型合并实际上增加了系统对迁移攻击的脆弱性，需要重新考虑其在安全系统设计中的应用。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）数量的增加，在有限公共数据的领域中，高效识别最适合下游微调的最佳模型变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: TimeTic将模型选择重新构建为上下文学习问题，利用数据集元特征、模型特性和微调性能形成的表格结构，采用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层间熵演化的新型模型表征方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的综合基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与未见数据集的实际微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，相比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性得分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic框架能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在下游数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Conclusion: CT-DDPG算法成功解决了连续时间强化学习中的时间离散化敏感性问题，为连续环境中的确定性策略学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Conclusion: FraudTransformer通过有效整合时间信息和序列顺序，在支付欺诈检测任务中表现出色，证明了时间编码和位置编码的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that

We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla

absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional

FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Conclusion: SAFDNet具有稳健的预测性能和低噪声敏感性，适合临床实际应用。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Conclusion: GBSK算法通过粒度球技术有效解决了大规模数据聚类问题，在保持精度的同时显著提升效率，自适应版本进一步增强了实用性。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with

Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度标记化能获得强连贯性但序列长复杂度高，紧凑标记化效率高但牺牲了标记内依赖关系建模能力。

Method: 采用延迟调度机制(DP)，将复合标记扩展到多个解码步骤，实现标记内依赖关系的自回归建模，同时保持效率。该方法轻量级，无需额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Conclusion: 延迟调度机制(DP)是解决符号音乐生成中效率-质量权衡的有效方法，能够在不增加参数的情况下显著提升性能。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用，BN能够适应不断变化的数据分布，提高收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN为DRL管道中的稳健BN集成提供了实用的可操作建议。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统性视角，表明原则性理论分析既能带来更强的理论保证，也能获得实际性能提升。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学启发，研究大语言模型中知识的结构组织，探索类似语义聚类和启动效应的知识同质性模式。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，分析实体与邻居的知识关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体级知识得分，优先检查知识较少的triplet。

Result: 发现LLMs对图中位置相近的实体具有相似的知识水平，基于同质性原则的GNN模型能有效预测知识得分，提升知识覆盖和推理效率。

Conclusion: 知识同质性模式可用于优化LLMs的知识注入和多跳推理，在相同标注预算下最大化知识覆盖，提高问答系统的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了Mamba模型在线性回归任务中的上下文学习能力，揭示了其通过在线梯度下降机制实现ICL，与Transformer的梯度下降模拟机制不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Mamba在长序列建模中表现出与Transformer竞争的上下文学习能力，但其理论机制尚未被充分理解，特别是在线性回归等基础任务上缺乏理论分析。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构非凸优化的新技术，分析其在线性回归ICL任务上的训练动态，建立指数收敛率和损失边界。

Result: 证明了Mamba能够以指数速率收敛到ICL解，损失边界与Transformer相当，并发现其通过在线梯度下降机制学习潜在函数。

Conclusion: Mamba通过在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，这与Transformer的梯度下降模拟机制存在本质差异，为理解Mamba的ICL能力提供了理论依据。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在图像噪声下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提升准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感。作者提出了一种基于Grounding DINO的增强方法来提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Visual CoT通过视觉编辑显著提升了多模态推理性能，但其在图像噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索，需要系统评估其脆弱性。

Method: 构建了包含12种图像噪声类型和4个VQA数据集的基准测试，比较使用和不使用Visual CoT的VLMs。提出集成Grounding DINO模型来提供高置信度视觉线索以稳定推理。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和噪声图像上都能提升绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更明显。中间推理组件（编辑的图像块）是脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的脆弱性模式，并提出了一种架构无关的有效解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，通过稀疏自编码器对从小数据集提取的转向向量进行语义去噪和增强，解决有限数据下转向向量包含任务无关噪声特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有转向方法依赖大规模数据集学习行为信息，限制了在现实场景中的应用。从小数据集提取的转向向量往往包含任务无关的噪声特征，影响其有效性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对转向向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义去除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性丰富小数据集中缺失的任务相关特征。

Result: 大量实验表明SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法，包括监督微调。

Conclusion: 通过SAEs精炼原始转向向量，可以从有限训练数据构建有效的转向向量。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

TL;DR: STAIR方法通过基于时间距离的阶段近似和同阶段优先比较，解决了多阶段任务中偏好学习中的阶段错位问题，提升了策略学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段任务中，比较不同阶段（如移动与操作）的片段会产生无意义的反馈，阻碍策略学习，这被称为阶段错位问题。

Method: 提出STAIR方法：首先基于时间距离学习阶段近似，通过对比学习将时间相近的状态分组为连贯阶段，然后优先比较同一阶段内的片段。

Result: 实验表明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中也有竞争力，且学习到的阶段与人类认知一致。

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解了多阶段任务中的阶段错位问题，无需预定义任务知识，能动态适应策略变化。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架FedAgent，旨在自动化医疗联邦学习中的复杂操作挑战，包括客户端选择、数据协调、算法选择等，并构建了FedAgentBench基准测试来评估LLM代理在医疗联邦学习中的自主协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、服务器与客户端协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。现有研究忽视了这些实际编排问题，因此需要开发自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了一个代理驱动的联邦学习框架，涵盖从客户端选择到训练完成的整个联邦学习工作流程。该框架整合了40种针对不同任务需求和跨客户端特征的联邦学习算法，并在201个精心策划的数据集上设置了多样化复杂任务，模拟了6种医疗环境。

Result: 评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的代理性能，发现某些代理核心如GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3能够自动化联邦学习管道的各个阶段，但基于隐含目标的更复杂、相互依赖的任务对即使是最强的模型仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 虽然先进的LLM代理能够部分自动化联邦学习流程，但复杂医疗环境中的自主协调仍然面临挑战，需要进一步研究来提升代理在医疗联邦学习中的自主决策能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，提出这种权衡可能是测量层面的假象。通过转向隐藏状态空间分析，发现探索和利用可以解耦，并开发了VERL方法来同时增强这两种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，认为这种权衡可能不是基本约束，而是测量层面的假象。希望通过隐藏状态空间分析来揭示探索和利用可以同时增强的可能性。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，通过有效秩(ER)及其一阶导数ERV和二阶导数ERA来量化探索和利用动态。利用理论上稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器，创建协同的双通道激励结构，直接塑造RL优势函数。

Result: 在多样化LLM和推理基准测试中显示出一致的性能提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索和利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会。VERL方法成功实现了探索-利用的协同增强，避免了传统权衡的限制。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: Tequila是一种针对大语言模型的三元权重量化方法，通过将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置来解决量化精度损失问题，在保持硬件效率的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的三元量化方法虽然硬件友好，但会导致严重的精度损失，核心问题是死区陷阱现象：大量权重被限制在死区边界，只能接收到噪声梯度信号，无法有效优化。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置，使这些权重在前向传播中提供连续信号，在反向传播中接收有意义的梯度信号，从而增强模型容量和优化效果。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上比SOTA基线准确率提升>4%，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），推理速度提升3.0倍。

Conclusion: Tequila为资源受限环境中部署先进大语言模型提供了高度实用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: 提出了IndexNet，一种基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过索引嵌入模块利用时间戳和变量索引的上下文语义信息，提升长期周期性模式捕捉能力和变量区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多变量时间序列预测方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息携带丰富的上下文语义，有潜力提升预测性能。

Method: IndexNet框架包含索引嵌入模块，由时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入两个组件组成。时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列，通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基线方法中取得了可比较的性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的通用性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前多变量时间序列预测研究中仍未充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN在未见测试图上推理时面临显著性能不确定性，需要评估模型是否适合在特定测试图上使用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：(1)测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异作为监督信号；(2)DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计DGNN在测试时动态图上的性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，DyGEval作为有效评估器，能够在分布偏移下准确评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同动态图上的性能。

Conclusion: DyGEval成功解决了DGNN模型评估这一新研究问题，为动态图神经网络在实际部署中的性能评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的晶体生成模型往往忽略晶体结构的对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性不足且不稳定。需要开发能够严格遵循晶体学对称约束的生成方法。

Method: 使用条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，将原子运动限制在其初始Wyckoff位置内。采用高效的群平均重新表述来实现对称化，计算开销极小。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，生成的晶体具有更高的对称性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过严格遵循晶体学对称约束，能够生成更接近真实晶体分布的对称结构，为晶体设计提供了有效的生成框架。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

TL;DR: 提出了一个贝叶斯MoE路由框架，通过建模路由决策的概率分布来替代确定性路由，解决了MoE模型的不稳定性和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不足和过度自信，使系统无法识别自身知识的局限性。

Method: 系统研究了三种在路由管道不同阶段引入原则性不确定性的方法：权重空间、对数空间和选择空间的贝叶斯路由方法。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测能力。

Conclusion: 通过针对核心架构组件，可以创建更可靠的内部不确定性信号，为构建更稳健和自感知的LLMs提供了实用路径。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART是一个解耦的GUI代理强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计和自适应数据管理，显著提升了训练效率和性能，在OSWorld基准测试中取得了42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在自动化桌面和移动任务方面具有潜力，但面临强化学习应用中的挑战：多轮交互速度慢和高质量交互数据不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、滚动服务、数据管理器和训练器，采用非阻塞通信和异步训练。引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整滚动参数、选择性训练高熵步骤和使用截断重要性采样。

Result: 显著提升了系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量和5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准测试中，DART-GUI-7B模型达到42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理有效解决了GUI代理强化学习中的效率和数据质量问题，为开源社区提供了有价值的贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [351] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由一小部分分歧标记驱动，这些标记在教师模型有不同偏见时会预测不同结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是为什么在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）的情况下也会发生潜意识学习。

Method: 通过控制实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记的作用，测试不同层的重要性，并评估潜意识学习的脆弱性。

Result: 发现分歧标记是潜意识学习的关键，早期层对偏见传递至关重要，仅微调单个早期层就足以实现潜意识学习，但这种现象很脆弱，轻微修改提示就能抑制。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习主要由分歧标记驱动，早期层起关键作用，但这种偏见传递很容易被干扰，为理解和控制模型蒸馏中的偏见传播提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已证明这些方法在某些特定架构中具有线性收敛性，但仍缺乏统一的理论。

Method: 作者提出了一个统一的证明方法，使用连续梯度下降（梯度流）来分析具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络训练过程。

Result: 该论文的主要贡献是一个通用的定理，不仅覆盖了之前未知结果的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。虽然理论结果仅在无穷小步长极限下精确，但与实际步长梯度下降方法的预测有很好的经验一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为深度神经网络训练的梯度优化方法提供了一个统一的理论框架，证明了在广泛激活函数下的线性收敛性，填补了现有理论的空白。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败，原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出动态正交持续微调(DOC)，追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，调整新任务参数梯度与历史功能方向正交。

Result: 在多个LLM持续学习基准测试中优于现有方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续LLM微调提供了强大工具，通过正交约束缓解新旧任务间的干扰。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，一种完全可微的结构化过参数化技术，通过将权重组分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现结构化稀疏正则化，并证明其理论等效于解决原始组稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能够有效压缩神经网络，但其不可微性导致无法与常规随机梯度下降兼容，需要专门的优化器或额外的后处理剪枝，且缺乏形式化保证。

Method: D-Gating方法将每个权重组分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，形成完全可微的结构化过参数化，证明其在梯度流极限下以指数速度收敛到L_{2,2/D}正则化损失。

Result: 在视觉、语言和表格任务上的验证表明，D-Gating始终提供强大的性能-稀疏性权衡，优于直接优化结构化惩罚和传统剪枝基线方法。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等效于解决原始组稀疏问题，但诱导了从非稀疏机制向稀疏优化的独特学习动态，为结构化稀疏正则化提供了有效的可微解决方案。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Conclusion: 所提出的通信与控制协同设计机制在保持移动地面用户公平通信速率与无人机能耗平衡的同时，显著提高了无人机群辅助通信的质量和能效。

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: GMAN框架在保持高性能的同时，提供了特征、节点和图级别的可解释性，能够提供可操作的、与领域对齐的解释。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

TL;DR: HiViS是一种用于视觉语言模型推测解码的框架，通过显式-隐式输入分解方法，将视觉令牌从草稿器输入中移除，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，显著加速VLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在加速大型语言模型推理方面很有效，但应用于视觉语言模型时面临挑战：视觉令牌导致语义表示不对齐和草稿器自注意力计算缓慢。

Method: 提出显式-隐式输入分解框架，移除草稿器输入中的视觉令牌，仅使用文本令牌作为显式输入，重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息；采用多步自反馈训练策略进行高效训练。

Result: 将草稿器的预填充序列长度压缩至目标VLM输入的0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量；在多种模型和任务上实现最高2.65倍的加速。

Conclusion: HiViS通过有效处理视觉令牌问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速了视觉语言模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Method: 使用内部指标MUI来研究MoE架构，明确纳入路由机制并分析专家级行为，系统分析多个公开可用的MoE模型。

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型进化而降低，训练呈现动态轨迹，任务完成需要多个专家协作，神经元激活模式可作为数据多样性代理。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于信号X与条件Y之间的互信息，分类器引导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这对图像模型特别有帮助。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则存在深刻联系，分类器引导通过提升互信息改善生成质量，同时指出了将扩散模型视为无限深度自编码器的观点需要更细致的理解。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Motivation: 虽然LLMs已经扩展到嵌入图像等多种模态，但神经解码仍受限于静态、非交互式方法，需要开发能够与脑数据进行自然语言交互的框架。

Method: 基于观看自然场景时记录的fMRI数据训练CorText，将神经活动直接整合到LLM的潜在空间中，实现开放式自然语言交互。

Result: CorText仅基于神经数据就能生成准确的图像描述，并能比对照组更好地回答详细问题，实现了训练中未见语义类别的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 这些进展标志着从被动解码向生成式、灵活的大脑活动与语言接口的转变。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理计算密集型任务。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought方法将高层策略规划与低层逐步执行混为一体，导致计算效率低下、推理路径探索有限、可解释性差。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：监督微调（含强制计划遵循的数据生成算法）和强化学习，实现探索与执行的解耦。

Result: 在AIME'2024上，E²C测试时扩展仅需<10%的解码token即达58.1%准确率；在医疗基准上，EF-SFT仅用3.5%的token即可获得比标准SFT高14.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: E²C框架通过分离规划与执行，实现了最先进的性能、强泛化能力和更高可解释性，显著降低自一致性开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiBS-MTL方法，一种基于方向性谈判解决方案的多任务学习算法，能够抵抗任务损失的非仿射单调变换带来的影响，并在非凸设置下保证收敛到帕累托稳定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中，任务损失可能被任意非仿射缩放，导致某些任务主导训练并降低整体性能。现有方法对此敏感，需要一种对单调非仿射变换具有不变性的解决方案。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的方向性谈判解决方案(DiBS)，开发了DiBS-MTL算法。该方法在标准假设下，即使任务损失非凸，也能保证子序列收敛到帕累托稳定点。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法表现相当，同时对非仿射单调变换具有鲁棒性，而现有方法（包括先前受博弈启发的MTL方法）的性能会显著下降。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL提供了一种计算高效的多任务学习方法，能够抵抗任务损失缩放带来的影响，在保持竞争性能的同时解决了任务主导问题。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究验证了Chinchilla缩放定律的可靠性，发现尽管存在参数定义模糊等问题，但其核心结论（计算最优的token与参数比例）对参数扰动具有鲁棒性，为语言模型缩放提供了可靠指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinchilla论文提出了计算最优缩放原则，但后续研究对其有效性提出了质疑，包括宽置信区间、方法间差异等问题。本研究旨在验证Chinchilla的指导原则是否仍然可靠。

Method: 通过分析Chinchilla中模型参数定义的三种可能解释，并系统地扰动模型参数（四种结构化方式），评估关键结果对参数变化的敏感性。

Result: 发现模型参数的具体定义对关键结果影响不大，计算最优的token与参数比例在不同参数解释下保持稳定。Chinchilla的核心结论能够承受相当大的参数扰动。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的缩放定律具有持久性，为语言模型缩放提供了可靠的指导原则，增强了领域对其的信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Motivation: 随着深度网络规模增大，数据集中的标签噪声会损害模型性能，需要自动化工具来检测这些错误。

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化虽能带来效率提升，但将金融规范转换为gas高效的可执行代码复杂度高，特别是从高级规范生成功能正确且经济可行的代码仍具挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

TL;DR: 提出了GUIDE框架，通过整合LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代因果发现方法面临可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性的严重限制，传统算法如PC、GES和ICA-LiNGAM在处理高阶节点时能耗过高，且无法扩展到70个节点以上。

Method: GUIDE框架采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: GUIDE显著优化计算效率，相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法平均减少约42%的运行时间，相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG单独平均提高约117%的准确性，并能扩展到≥70个节点。

Conclusion: GUIDE在混合数据类型和可扩展性方面表现出色，在基线方法失效的≥70节点设置下仍能保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：在存在虚假相关性的下游任务中，使用弱教师的伪标签微调强预训练学生模型时，弱到强泛化是否会发生以及如何改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弱到强泛化在存在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性时的表现，特别是当标记数据和无标记数据的群体分布不一致时，弱到强泛化可能会失败。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下精确表征弱到强泛化增益，并通过实验验证。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在弱到强微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当无标记数据和标记数据的群体分布相同时，弱到强泛化总能发生；但当分布不同时，弱到强泛化增益会随着分布差异的平方而减少。实验验证了理论结果，提出的算法在多个基准测试中显著改进了性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体分布匹配时有效，但在分布不匹配时可能失败。提出的无需群体标签的重新训练算法能够一致地显著改进弱到强微调性能。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算和跳过处理，显著加速扩散模型的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）模型在视频生成中，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，因为序列长度长且注意力计算具有二次复杂度。研究发现注意力权重可以分为高秩的大权重和低秩的小权重两部分。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分类为关键、边缘和可忽略三类：对关键权重应用O(N²)注意力计算，对边缘权重应用O(N)线性注意力计算，跳过可忽略权重。所有计算集成在单个GPU内核中，支持前向和后向传播。

Result: 仅需少量微调步骤，SLA使DiT模型的注意力计算减少20倍，注意力计算减少95%且不降低生成质量。高效GPU内核实现注意力计算13.7倍加速，视频生成端到端2.2倍加速。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速扩散模型的注意力计算，优于基线方法。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Motivation: 当前研究主要集中在拟合缩放定律和预测预训练损失及判别式评估性能，但对生成式评估（如数学问题解决、软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。

Method: 提出并评估三种预训练缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律，(2) 基于模型参数和训练token的缩放定律，(3) 基于黄金参考解对数似然的缩放定律。

Result: 发现计算量和参数+token缩放定律在最后约1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后约5个数量级稳定；三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算量定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然在大k时预测稍差。

Conclusion: 建立了计算量缩放定律作为参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络的理论连接，为研究人员提供了预测生成性能的框架和方法论。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的合作提供了理论基础和实际有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

Motivation: 现有的离线强化学习方法通常依赖单一的全局Q函数，难以捕捉涉及多样化子任务的任务组合性质。

Method: 使用线性Transformer将Q学习构建为上下文推理问题，通过检索的转移自适应推断局部Q函数，无需显式子任务标签。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线RL提供了一个原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统的策略选择理论现代化，采用类似大语言模型的神经网络架构，以更好地模拟儿童算术学习过程。

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个开放获取的室内水产养殖环境质量数据集，记录了6个IEQ变量，填补了智能水产养殖信息学中的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于描述室内养殖池周围空气环境的公共数据集稀缺，限制了结合空气条件和水质动态的预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用Awair HOME监测器每5分钟采样一次，从2024年10月14日到2025年1月9日，产生超过23,000个时间戳观测值，采用ISO标准安装高度，并通过参考仪器进行校准检查。

Result: 探索性统计显示环境条件稳定（CO2中位数=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米），在喂食时间出现明显峰值，为短期预测、事件检测和传感器漂移研究提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据中心的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Result: 开发了用于数据密度近似的多中心学习方法

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效学习定义混合密度所需的多个中心，为自监督和对比特征学习提供了新的密度近似框架

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Conclusion: DAFH算法能够在无需人口统计信息的情况下实现偏好公平性，为高风险领域提供了实用的公平性解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备设备端LLM范式，利用对等设备状态实现更智能的跨层控制，解决传统方法在动态无线环境中的局限性

Method: 使用上下文感知奖励（基于延迟容忍度和电池状态）进行KL微调，开发了PEARL（Head+LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）两种轻量变体

Result: 在合成场景中优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，在协作低电量情况下能耗降低达16%，PEARL-Lite实现亚20ms推理延迟

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头的高效性使LLM适用于持续运行的设备端跨层控制

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

TL;DR: 提出Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决了现有等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局注意力机制是transformer成功的关键，但存在二次计算成本；等变模型在物理、生化、计算机视觉和机器人任务中通常能获得更高精度，但计算需求大。现有等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了其表达能力和性能。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer通过高效的全局注意力机制，成功解决了等变transformer在计算效率和表达能力方面的限制，为等变深度学习模型提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出ADAPT模型，用基于坐标的Transformer架构替代图神经网络，解决了点缺陷建模中的过平滑和长程相互作用问题，在硅点缺陷数据集上相比GNN模型减少33%的力和能量预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一性原理方法计算点缺陷能量和结构成本高昂，机器学习力场是加速结构弛豫的有吸引力的替代方案。现有基于GNN的MLFF存在过平滑和长程相互作用表征不足的问题，这在点缺陷建模中尤为关键。

Method: 引入ADAPT模型，用直接坐标空间表示替代图表示，显式考虑所有原子对相互作用，将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模相互作用。

Result: 在硅点缺陷数据集上，ADAPT相比最先进的GNN模型在力和能量预测误差上减少约33%，同时计算成本仅为GNN的一小部分。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过坐标空间表示和Transformer架构有效解决了点缺陷建模中的关键挑战，在精度和效率上都优于GNN方法。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何上的逆问题提供了一个有效的解决方案，结合了几何感知编码和扩散建模的优势，实现了准确重建和高效推理。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为可扩展和泛化的解决方案，通过自注意力机制的可解释性结果证明了其在真实世界医疗应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，EFNs相比PatchTST等方法训练速度快4倍，模型尺寸小3倍，预测误差从43%降至35%，相对改进20%。EchoFormer在ETTh等数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EFNs框架在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和长期稳定性，为长序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

Conclusion: 仅解码器transformer在逆排列学习任务上存在表达式限制，但通过特定构造（如草稿标记）可以克服这一限制，这可能为思维链提示中的中间"思考"标记提供理论解释。

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Conclusion: 该方法为分类问题提供了新的理论框架，能够在最小标签查询下实现完美分类并确定类别数量，特别适用于处理重叠类别边界的情况。

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上有基础、实践中可扩展的大语言模型遗忘框架，解决了现有方法的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

*Qipeng Zhan,Zhuoping Zhou,Zexuan Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多尺度几何自编码器(MAE)，通过非对称架构同时保持数据的全局和局部几何结构，在编码器应用全局距离约束，在解码器应用局部几何约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大尺度关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，编码器负责全局距离约束，解码器负责局部几何约束，通过多尺度几何结构保持来优化数据表示。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 非对称设计能够有效同时保持数据的全局和局部几何结构，提升自编码器的表示能力。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Random Selection Probing (RSP)框架，通过统计假设检验检测模型间的相关性，为LLMs和VLMs提供原则性的模型关联检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型相似性检测方法需要访问模型参数或产生缺乏原则性阈值的启发式分数，限制了应用范围。需要可靠技术来确定模型是否从另一个模型微调而来或完全相同。

Method: RSP框架在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，评估其到目标模型的可转移性，产生严格的p值量化相关性证据。引入无关基线模型过滤通用可转移特征以减少假阳性。

Result: 在LLMs和VLMs上的实验表明，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对无关模型保持高p值。消融研究证明了RSP的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是首个原则性、通用的模型相关性检测统计框架，能够在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明和可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: FM-FoG是一种基于基础模型的实时可穿戴系统，无需患者特定训练即可检测帕金森患者的冻结步态，在未见过的患者上达到98.5%的F1分数，并显著延长电池寿命。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有冻结步态检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力的问题，推动临床部署。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型。

Result: 在23名PD患者的VCU FoG-IMU数据集上测试，对未见患者达到98.5% F1分数，比基线方法显著提升，在智能手机上部署可延长电池寿命72%，延迟低于20ms。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现无需个体化训练、跨患者泛化的实用高效医疗应用。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现语言模型中存在一类特殊的Wasserstein神经元，它们虽然数量极少但在语法处理中起关键作用，通过负激活空间区分相似输入，对语法功能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中特定类型神经元的功能，特别是那些在相似输入区分中起关键作用的Wasserstein神经元，探索它们在语法处理中的独特机制。

Method: 通过目标性移除实验、负预激活干预、词性分析和分层干预等方法，研究Wasserstein神经元在语法处理中的功能。

Result: Wasserstein神经元在负激活空间中对相似输入进行区分，特别是针对语法标记；针对这些神经元的负预激活干预会显著削弱模型功能并破坏语法行为。

Conclusion: 稀疏的Wasserstein神经元中的负激活分化是语言模型依赖的关键语法机制，这些神经元在训练过程中出现并稳定后对语法处理至关重要。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Motivation: 受实际应用约束、LLM-RL基础设施复杂性以及RL方法学进一步创新的需求驱动，研究大语言模型的离策略强化学习。

Method: 通过第一性原理推导组相对REINFORCE，不假设特定训练数据分布，证明其具有原生离策略解释。提出正则化策略更新和主动塑造数据分布两个原则。

Result: 分析澄清了GRPO中重要性采样和裁剪的作用，统一并重新解释了OPMD和AsymRE算法作为REINFORCE损失的正则化形式，为启发式数据加权策略提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 研究结果为离策略RL在LLMs中的原则性算法设计提供了可操作的见解和新机会，并通过实证研究验证了这些发现。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker是一个基于大语言模型的抑郁症诊断框架，通过监督微调和强化学习结合，在UK Biobank数据集上训练，显著优于传统方法和通用LLM，准确率达到0.8268。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观评估，缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力。大语言模型虽能提高诊断准确性，但面临可解释性差、幻觉问题和依赖合成数据等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，结合监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力。使用UK Biobank数据集生成40,000个推理样本，补充10,000个公开心理健康数据集样本，对模型进行微调。

Result: MDD-Thinker准确率0.8268，F1分数0.8081，显著优于SVM、MLP等传统方法和通用LLM。结合SFT和RL带来最大改进：准确率相对提升29.0%，F1分数提升38.1%，AUC提升34.8%。推理性能与更大LLM相当，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强LLM抑郁症诊断框架。MDD-Thinker在准确性、可解释性和效率间取得平衡，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法，推理导向的LLM可为抑郁症检测提供临床可靠支持。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CAOTE方法，通过结合注意力分数和值向量来优化token驱逐误差，提升长上下文LLM在资源受限设备上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文支持导致内存和计算瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的token驱逐方法缺乏对token在注意力输出中贡献的信息

Method: 基于缓存token对注意力输出的贡献设计驱逐标准，将注意力分数和值向量无缝集成，可作为元启发式方法与任何token驱逐方法灵活结合

Result: 与最先进的基于注意力分数的方法结合时，CAOTE始终提高下游任务的准确率

Conclusion: 在token驱逐过程中利用值向量的信息至关重要，CAOTE方法能有效改善现有token驱逐方法的性能

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conda的新型优化器，通过将更新投影到正交子空间并应用基于投影梯度的列归一化，结合了Adam的坐标自适应性和Muon的谱归一化优势，在大规模LLM预训练中显著提升了收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Adam优化器虽然收敛快，但存在谱条件差和低秩结构问题，而Muon虽然解决了谱问题但缺乏坐标自适应能力。需要结合两者优势来提升LLM预训练效率。

Method: Conda优化器将更新投影到正交子空间，并基于投影梯度应用列归一化，同时保持坐标自适应性和改善谱条件。

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上的实验表明，Conda持续优于AdamW、Muon等基线方法，在LLaMA系列上实现了2-2.5倍的收敛速度提升（按训练步数和训练时间衡量）。

Conclusion: Conda是一种有效且广泛适用的大规模LLM训练优化器，能够显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

Motivation: 现有的图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入伪影，需要一种能保持视觉相似性同时实现语义编辑的方法

Method: 使用耦合SDEs，通过相同的相关噪声驱动源图像和编辑图像，引导采样过程向期望语义靠近

Result: 方法无需重新训练或辅助网络，实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级的图像一致性

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial

framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

Result: 建立了可访问、现实且公平的PU学习算法评估环境，解决了模型选择依赖负样本数据的不现实问题。

Conclusion: 该基准框架为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化、现实和公平的比较环境。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

Method: 构建ChessArena竞争框架，让LLMs在四种不同游戏模式下相互对战，配备排名算法和排行榜，评估基础理解、走子选择和谜题解决等细粒度能力。

Result: 评估了13个LLMs的800多场比赛，没有模型能击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100，部分模型甚至输给随机玩家。微调的Qwen3-8B表现显著提升，接近更大规模的最先进推理模型。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂战略推理方面存在重大不足，但通过微调可以显著提升性能，表明模型具备改进潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应于图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

TL;DR: 提出了一个模拟框架来建模ESP作弊者、非作弊者和轨迹检测器，通过强化学习代理和对抗性游戏来研究自适应作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果在玩家行为中不可直接观察，且缺乏可靠标注数据，作弊者还会调整行为来规避检测。

Method: 使用强化学习代理建模作弊者和非作弊者，检测器对其行为轨迹分类；将作弊者与检测器互动建模为对抗性游戏；引入结构化作弊者模型动态切换作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，能够战略性地平衡奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

TL;DR: ELASTIQ是一个将语言指令与EEG信号对齐的基础模型，通过语义任务指导和查询增强EEG表征学习，在多个BCI任务上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以整合语言指令作为先验约束，限制了利用语言语义知识统一不同标签和任务的能力。

Method: 提出联合谱时重构模块进行预训练，结合频率掩码和两种时序目标；在指令调优阶段使用指令条件Q-Former，通过可学习查询将指令嵌入注入EEG token并与文本标签嵌入对齐。

Result: 在20个数据集上评估，涵盖运动想象、情绪识别、稳态视觉诱发电位、内隐言语和医疗任务，在14个数据集上达到最先进性能，在全部5个任务类别中获得最佳平均结果。

Conclusion: 首次分析表明显式任务指令作为语义先验，引导EEG嵌入进入连贯且基于语言的空间，增强了EEG表征的鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式强化学习方法在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈下的理论研究不足，需要开发能够处理这些挑战的高效算法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：Rennala NIGT在均匀设置下支持AllReduce操作，Malenia NIGT专门处理异构环境和异步计算。

Result: 在均匀设置下显著改善了总计算和通信复杂度，在异构设置下获得了更好的理论保证，实验表明显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法在分布式强化学习中有效解决了异步计算和通信瓶颈问题，为异构环境提供了理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本研究使用科学机器学习框架结合通用微分方程预测土壤有机碳动态，在无噪声和中等噪声条件下表现优异，但在高噪声下出现过拟合或过度平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳对土壤健康和全球气候韧性至关重要，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 采用基于通用微分方程的科学机器学习框架，将机械物理过程（如平流扩散传输）与学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸的神经网络相结合。

Result: 在无噪声条件下实现近乎完美的预测精度（MSE = 1.6e-5，R2 = 0.9999）；在7%噪声下保持稳健；但在35%高噪声下出现明显过拟合或过度平滑问题。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适用于可扩展、耐噪声的土壤有机碳预测，但需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学集成才能实现野外部署。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SALT方法，通过两阶段训练（像素重建和掩码潜在预测）替代EMA教师，实现更高效、可扩展的视频表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA使用EMA更新教师虽然防止表示崩溃，但增加了模型选择的复杂性并耦合了师生架构。

Method: 两阶段训练：先训练目标编码器进行像素重建，然后冻结教师，训练学生预测掩码区域的潜在表示。

Result: SALT在多个基准测试中超越V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，缩放曲线主导V-JEPA的准确率-FLOPs帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: SALT是EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，学生质量对教师质量具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出AuON优化器，通过非线性缩放和归一化实现线性时间复杂度的正交梯度更新，避免构建半正交矩阵，性能与AdamW和Muon相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度方法计算成本高（O(n^3)），且动量应用受限；现有改进方法如Muon仍存在二次复杂度瓶颈。

Method: AuON通过双曲余弦RMS缩放变换和归一化，在谱范数信任区域内约束动量更新，保持方向信息而不需要显式半正交化。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体性能与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当。

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，无需构建半正交矩阵即可实现正交梯度更新的优势。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出了H+方法，一种新颖的相似性感知聚合方法，能够在有或没有干净数据的情况下有效抵御拜占庭攻击，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到拜占庭攻击的威胁，现有基于相似性感知的聚合方法需要干净数据，但在实际场景中干净数据往往不可用，因此需要开发不依赖干净数据的鲁棒聚合方法。

Method: H+方法随机选择参数向量的r维片段，应用相似性检查函数H将每个片段与参考向量比较，保留最相似的客户端向量进行聚合。参考向量可从现有鲁棒算法或干净数据获得，重复K次以有效识别诚实客户端。

Result: H+在各种拜占庭攻击比例和多种传统拜占庭攻击类型下，在所有评估场景和基准数据集上都表现出最先进的鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H+是一种计算复杂度低、无需干净数据即可有效抵御拜占庭攻击的联邦学习聚合方法，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现实物理环境中的PDE系统参数多变，现有方法在零样本OOD泛化能力上不足，仍需测试时样本进行领域适应，因为尚未探索PDE动力学系统中的基本物理不变性。

Method: 首先明确定义了双重的PDE不变性原理，然后提出iMOOE方法，包含不变性对齐的混合算子专家架构和频率增强的不变学习目标。

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中验证了iMOOE在分布内性能和多种OOD预测场景下的零样本泛化能力均表现优越。

Conclusion: iMOOE通过捕获PDE系统的双重不变性，显著提升了零样本OOD泛化能力，为物理动力学预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对扩散语言模型的水印方案，解决了传统自回归语言模型水印方法无法直接应用于DLM的问题，通过期望上下文和提升水印强度来实现可靠的水印检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型能够以任意顺序生成标记，这与标准自回归语言模型按顺序生成的方式不同。现有的ARLM水印方案依赖先前生成的标记，而DLM生成时这些标记并不总是可用，因此需要专门的水印方案。

Method: 通过两种方法解决挑战：(i)在上下文标记尚未确定时，在期望上应用水印；(ii)提升那些在其他标记作为上下文时能增加水印强度的标记。同时保持水印检测器不变。

Result: 实验评估显示，DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，对质量影响极小，并且达到了与现有ARLM水印相似的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了可靠的扩散语言模型水印，为这一新兴LLM范式提供了有效的内容认证解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）在小规模模型中曾表现出与强化学习（RL）相当的性能，但由于被认为难以扩展到更大模型而被忽视。本研究旨在重新评估ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 使用进化策略（ES）对预训练大语言模型进行全参数微调，突破了传统认为ES难以扩展到数十亿参数规模的限制。

Result: ES在样本效率、长时程奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励破解倾向性以及跨运行稳定性等多个方面均优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: 进化策略为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明ES能够有效处理数十亿参数的搜索问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS框架通过为冻结的LLM提供三种互补提示（数值符号、上下文集成的时间序列编码、任务先验），解决了时间序列异常检测中LLM直接处理连续信号的挑战，显著提升了异常解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列异常检测需要解释异常的模式和原因，但LLM难以直接处理连续信号，简单的时间序列文本化方法缺乏上下文基础和表示对齐。

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化时间序列，而是为LLM提供三种提示：数值符号提示用于数值基础、从预训练时间序列编码器提取的上下文集成提示用于捕捉细粒度动态、任务先验提示用于编码全局异常特征。

Result: 实验表明AXIS产生的解释质量显著更高，检测准确性与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相当。

Conclusion: AXIS通过多模态提示有效解决了LLM处理时间序列的挑战，为可解释的时间序列异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

Motivation: 研究Muon优化器在训练transformer时的理论基础和实际效果，特别是在小到中等规模模型上的表现，验证其在大批量训练中的数据效率优势。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析包括收敛率、谱正则化性质、Stiefel流形上的自然梯度下降连接，以及谱范数下的最速梯度下降等价性。结合MLA和MoE进行实证评估。

Result: Muon达到目标损失仅需AdamW 48-52%的训练计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。MLA+MoE+Muon组合实现68%内存减少、3.2倍推理加速，困惑度改善8-12%。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ScatterAD方法，利用高维空间中正常和异常样本的分散特性作为归纳信号，通过建模时间和拓扑维度的表示散射来增强多变量时间序列异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网中多变量时间序列异常检测面临复杂时空耦合的挑战，传统方法独立建模空间或时间依赖关系导致表示学习不理想，对高维空间中异常分散的敏感性有限。

Method: 提出ScatterAD方法，包含拓扑编码器捕获图结构散射，时间编码器通过最小化相邻时间步的均方误差来约束过度散射，并引入对比融合机制确保时间和拓扑表示的互补性。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ScatterAD在多变量时间序列异常检测上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过理论证明最大化时间和拓扑视图之间的条件互信息可以提高跨视图一致性并增强更具区分性的表示，ScatterAD有效利用了表示散射作为归纳信号来改进时空异常检测。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiHDTrans是一种高效的神经符号二元超维Transformer，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，统一了HD计算的高效表示能力和Transformer的时间建模能力，在资源受限的边缘环境中实现准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的激增产生了大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer虽然擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，利用全息高维空间的二值化特性，在FPGA上实现硬件加速的流水线实现。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二元Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。在FPGA加速下，推理延迟比最先进二元Transformer低39.4倍。即使减少64%的超空间维度，仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，实现了准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模态对齐的多模态嵌入语义压缩方法，通过减少模态间隙来实现高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著降低存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态表示学习产生的高维嵌入虽然具有良好的泛化能力，但面临存储和下游处理的可扩展性挑战。关键问题是如何在减少嵌入内存占用的同时，保持其跨模态语义内容表示能力。

Method: 提出基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，当模态间隙足够小时，不同模态但表达相同语义的嵌入共享空间区域，可以用单个质心替代多个嵌入，实现显著内存节省。该方法直接在预训练编码器上操作。

Result: 在多样化大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著压缩而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法在保持性能的同时实现了显著压缩效果。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于进化框架的大语言模型训练方法，通过将模型划分为多个专家网络，每个训练步骤只训练一个专家，并结合进化算子来加速训练过程，显著减少内存需求和提升训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型训练需要大量内存和计算资源，限制了在资源受限环境下的应用。本文旨在通过进化训练框架降低训练资源需求，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 将模型划分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家网络，每个训练步骤只训练一个专家。在AdamW优化后，应用交叉、粒子群优化和变异等进化算子，使当前专家学习最佳专家的经验。最终只保存最佳专家的权重。

Result: 最佳专家能达到与完整模型几乎相同的准确率，同时训练吞吐量提升超过10倍，显著减少内存需求。

Conclusion: 该进化训练框架能有效降低大语言模型的训练资源需求，提升训练效率，同时保持模型性能，适合在PC和边缘计算设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不平衡Wasserstein距离的分布式鲁棒联邦学习算法，能够同时处理分布偏移和异常值影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DRO的联邦学习方法忽视了本地数据集中异常值的有害影响，这些异常值会不成比例地偏倚学习模型。

Method: 引入基于不平衡Wasserstein距离的新型模糊集，结合几何分布偏移和非几何KL惩罚来减轻异常值影响，通过拉格朗日惩罚优化实现去中心化训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的分布异常值鲁棒联邦学习算法具有鲁棒性保证和收敛保证，能够有效处理分布扰动和异常值问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法虽然理论坚实，但在大规模数据上的可扩展性受限，特别是在表示学习领域缺乏可扩展框架，限制了其在基础模型时代的应用。

Method: 使用Nyström近似构建统一的核表示学习框架KREPES，支持多种无监督和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在大规模图像和表格数据集上的实验证明了KREPES的高效性，并且能够提供学习表示的可解释性分析。

Conclusion: KREPES填补了核方法在可扩展表示学习方面的空白，为核方法在大规模无标签数据学习中的应用提供了可行方案，同时保持了核方法的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FS-KAN（函数共享KAN），一种构建任意置换对称群的等变和不变KA层的原理性方法，统一并显著扩展了该领域的先前工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然等变KAN在特定数据类型中已被探索，但在一般背景下应用置换对称数据的原理性框架仍然缺失。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，推导FS-KAN层的基本构造，并提供理论分析证明其表达能力与标准参数共享网络相同。

Result: 在多种数据类型和对称群上的实证评估显示，FS-KAN在某些情况下比标准参数共享层表现出显著优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在低数据机制中保持了KAN的可解释性和适应性，同时具有卓越的数据效率，是优秀的架构选择。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: SMoPE是一个新颖的持续学习框架，通过稀疏混合专家架构组织共享提示，动态激活相关专家来平衡效率和性能，显著减少参数和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中任务专用提示方法计算开销大、内存需求随任务线性增长，而共享提示方法存在知识干扰导致性能下降的权衡问题。

Method: 将共享提示组织为多个"提示专家"的稀疏MoE架构，引入提示注意力分数聚合机制进行动态稀疏激活，采用自适应噪声机制平衡专家利用，设计基于原型的损失函数增强专家专业化。

Result: 在多个CL基准测试中，SMoPE持续优于任务专用提示方法，性能与最先进方法相当，同时显著减少参数数量和计算成本。

Conclusion: SMoPE成功整合了任务专用和共享提示策略的优势，通过稀疏专家激活机制有效缓解知识干扰，实现了高效且高性能的持续学习。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

TL;DR: GUIDE是一种轻量级的证据学习元模型方法，可以附加到冻结的深度学习模型上，明确学习如何以及何时表达不确定性，无需重新训练或修改架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移不确定性量化是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有后处理方法要么继承错误置信度，要么仅重塑预测，未能教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动课程，教会模型如何和何时表达不确定性。无需重新训练、架构修改或手动中间层选择。

Result: GUIDE避免从基础模型蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高约77%，对抗攻击检测提高约80%，同时保持分布内性能。在多样化基准测试中持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE证明了主动引导不确定性的必要性，以缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM DNA概念，将大语言模型的功能行为表示为低维、双Lipschitz表示，用于追踪模型间的进化关系，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型数量爆炸式增长，但模型间的进化关系（如微调、蒸馏、适应）往往缺乏文档记录或不清晰，给LLM管理带来困难。现有方法受限于任务特异性、固定模型集或对分词器和架构的严格假设。

Method: 受生物DNA启发，数学定义LLM DNA作为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论特性，并建立DNA存在性理论。基于此理论，推导出通用、可扩展、无需训练的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前在有限子集上的研究一致，在特定任务上表现优异或具有竞争力。DNA比较揭示了LLM间先前未记录的关联关系，并构建了LLM进化树，显示从编码器-解码器到仅解码器架构的转变，反映时间进展，并揭示不同LLM家族的进化速度差异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为理解和管理大语言模型的进化关系提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够有效追踪模型间的遗传关系并构建进化历史。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对TTT为何有效以及何时有效理解有限，之前的解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据使用，但随着基础模型规模扩大且大多数测试数据是分布内数据，这些解释受到质疑。

Method: 在线性表示假设下提出理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 理论分析表明TTT能实现比全局训练更小的分布内测试误差，实证验证显示语义相关的数据点仅由少数共享概念解释，扩展研究确定了专门化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: 基础模型在全局上是欠参数化的，TTT通过专门化机制在泛化后集中容量于相关概念，从而提升性能，特别是在特定机制下最为有效。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

Method: 研究时空预测任务中的各种模型，包括标准物理信息模型和更现代的流匹配模型，探索不同层次的物理学归纳偏置。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理学归纳偏置可以在考虑的任务中保持甚至提高效能的同时，带来显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: 物理学归纳偏置为提高机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法，模型效率应与模型效能一起成为机器学习开发和部署的核心考虑因素。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少样本持续事件检测中存在严重遗忘问题，因为共享基础模型的完全微调会导致任务间知识干扰，且数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义扭曲的输入。

Method: LEAF在基础模型中集成专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；采用语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；引入基于标签描述的对比学习目标；使用知识蒸馏策略防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LEAF始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、减少知识干扰和改善有限数据下的泛化能力，有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的多模态引导机制MDG，用于视频到音频生成，通过利用模态嵌入空间来增强视频、音频和文本的统一对齐。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法要么需要在大规模配对数据集上进行昂贵的联合训练，要么依赖可能无法捕捉全局多模态一致性的成对相似性。

Method: 基于预训练音频扩散模型，提出多模态扩散引导(MDG)，利用模态嵌入空间提供轻量级即插即用的控制信号，无需重新训练。

Result: 在VGGSound和AudioCaps数据集上的实验表明，MDG相比基线方法持续提升了感知质量和多模态对齐效果。

Conclusion: 证明了联合多模态引导在视频到音频生成中的有效性，MDG为V2A提供了一种高效的无训练解决方案。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

TL;DR: SWAX是一种结合滑动窗口注意力机制和xLSTM线性RNN层的混合架构，研究发现较小的滑动窗口反而能提升长上下文性能，通过随机改变窗口大小训练模型，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都优于常规窗口注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构优于单独的注意力或RNN架构，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力与RNN层之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 提出SWAX混合架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，采用随机改变窗口大小的训练策略。

Result: 反直觉发现：更大的滑动窗口不会改善长上下文性能，短窗口注意力通过减少对注意力机制的依赖，能更好地训练xLSTM的长时记忆。随机窗口训练在短上下文和长上下文任务上都显著优于常规窗口注意力。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口训练策略，有效平衡了短上下文和长上下文需求，显著提升了混合架构的性能。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破以往低雷诺数数值模拟的限制，在具有挑战性的实验环境中实现实时控制，解决执行器延迟等实际约束问题。

Method: 采用深度强化学习算法，通过旋转驱动控制圆柱体涡激振动，实验在雷诺数3000条件下进行，使用位移和速度作为状态反馈。

Result: 仅使用状态反馈时，学习到低频旋转控制策略，实现80%振动抑制；加入历史控制动作后，学习到高频旋转控制策略，实现超过95%的振动衰减。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验中具有适应性，能够克服执行器延迟等仪器限制，为主动流动控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言动作模型(VLAs)是否在基于策略的强化学习训练过程中隐含地学习世界模型，这是基于模型的强化学习的典型特征。

Method: 使用嵌入算术方法，通过线性非线性探针分析OpenVLA模型各层的激活状态，测量状态转换向量的可恢复性。

Result: 发现模型在中间激活层对状态转换具有显著预测能力，超过基线水平，表明OpenVLA编码了内部世界模型。早期检查点分析显示世界模型随训练进展而涌现。

Conclusion: OpenVLA视觉语言动作模型确实隐含学习世界模型，这为理解VLAs的内部表征提供了新视角，并提出了利用稀疏自编码器分析世界模型的管道。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

Motivation: PDE约束优化问题在科学和工程领域广泛存在，但决策变量与PDE状态变量紧密耦合，计算需求高，需要处理高维离散化和动态约束。

Method: 采用双网络设计：动态预测器（时间离散神经算子）高效逼近PDE动力学系统轨迹，优化代理利用代理优化技术逼近最优决策。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实时逼近最优策略，同时显式捕捉决策与PDE动力学之间的耦合关系，为PDE约束优化提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Result: SAIP在多种图像恢复任务中持续提升重建质量，包括具有挑战性的场景

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法中固定尺度设计的局限性，显著改善了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的性能

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: CURA是一种受模拟音频信号处理电路启发的紧凑型AI架构，可在资源受限环境中实现跨领域的机器学习任务，相比现有方法参数减少2500倍，同时在回归、分类、NLP和计算机视觉任务中保持优异性能。

Motivation: 解决现有设备端AI架构的两个关键限制：缺乏紧凑性（参数量随任务复杂度线性增长）和泛化能力差（特定领域模型无法适应其他应用）。

Method: 提出CURA架构，灵感来源于模拟音频信号处理电路，提供紧凑轻量的解决方案，能够适应多种机器学习任务。

Result: 在紧凑性方面，使用比基线模型少2500倍的参数达到同等精度；在泛化性方面，在四个NLP基准和一个计算机视觉数据集上表现一致，F1分数高达90%；在复杂模式识别方面，平均绝对误差降低1.6倍，均方误差降低2.1倍。

Conclusion: CURA架构为资源受限环境提供了紧凑、泛化性强且能识别复杂模式的AI解决方案，在多个领域都表现出色。

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线在模型评估中的关系、优缺点，发现决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者在相同阈值下会选择相同的最优模型，但Brier曲线适用范围更广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类模型通常使用决策阈值进行分类，适当的模型评估应考虑模型使用背景，包括正负样本正确分类的相对价值。决策曲线分析和成本曲线是评估预测模型期望效用和期望损失的两种方法。

Method: 比较决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线，分析它们之间的关系、优势和局限性。特别关注决策曲线与Brier曲线的关系，假设模型分数已校准，并使用正负分类的相对价值设置分类阈值。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者x轴等价。在任何给定阈值下，净收益(用于DCA)和Brier损失(用于Brier曲线)总是选择相同的最优模型。Brier曲线适用范围更广，Brier曲线下面积即为Brier分数。

Conclusion: Brier曲线比决策曲线分析具有更广泛的适用性，建议将上包络决策曲线作为DCA的有用比较，显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交分解方法有效解决了多目标偏好对齐中的冲突问题，实现了稳定收敛和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型取得了显著进展，但在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是表现出"两跳推理诅咒"现象，即模型无法进行超出训练分布的两跳推理。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化的Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；对于复杂任务，采用小初始化或权重衰减来增强正则化效果；扩展到大规模模型研究。

Result: 经验证明该方法使模型能够成功执行超出分布的两跳推理任务；理论分析显示身份监督通过隐式核范数正则化诱导潜在空间对齐；大规模模型仍通过潜在记忆实现两跳推理。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决组合推理问题，身份监督通过重塑潜在几何结构实现任务间结构共享，为增强大语言模型的隐式推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但默认的欧几里得几何可能与生物数据固有的层次结构不匹配。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列的掩码语言模型预训练。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个属性预测任务中有9个优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现出色；在抗体区域注释任务中，比层次感知的欧几里得模型准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何是mRNA序列层次语言建模的有效归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM实时个性化提供了一种有效的新范式，能够解决冷启动问题并高效适应新用户偏好。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

*Michael Drolet,Firas Al-Hafez,Aditya Bhatt,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自然梯度的离散VAE训练框架，无需重参数化即可更新参数编码器，在ImageNet等高维数据重建任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散VAE在变分自编码器中提供高比特效率，但离散随机变量无法精确微分参数化，现有近似方法如Gumbel-Softmax或REINFORCE在高维任务中效果有限。

Method: 利用策略搜索中的技术，提出基于自然梯度的训练框架，结合自动步长调整和基于transformer的编码器，无需重参数化即可更新参数编码器。

Result: 在ImageNet等挑战性数据集上，该方法在从紧凑潜在空间重建高维数据方面优于近似重参数化方法和基于量化的离散自编码器，在ImageNet 256上FID分数提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了离散VAE在高维任务中的训练难题，为多模态搜索等应用提供了更有效的离散潜在表示学习方案。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

*Sanxing Chen,Xiaoyin Chen,Yukun Huang,Roy Xie,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)训练LLMs在序列决策中的探索能力，发现这些方法能让LLMs在多臂老虎机任务中达到接近UCB和Thompson采样的性能，但可能导致过早放弃探索的贪婪行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在序列决策中探索能力不足，需要研究如何通过SFT和RL训练来提升其探索策略，并理解这些方法如何影响探索行为和泛化能力。

Method: 使用SFT在专家轨迹上训练LLMs，以及使用包括策略性后悔形状奖励和算法奖励在内的多种定制奖励信号进行RL训练，以减少方差并实现oracle模仿。

Result: 训练后的代理在性能上超越预训练模型，达到与UCB和Thompson采样相当的水平，并能泛化到6倍更长的时域和不同老虎机家族。行为分析显示收益主要来自更复杂但更贪婪的利用策略。

Conclusion: SFT和RL训练能有效提升LLMs的探索能力，但可能导致过早放弃探索的问题。需要定制奖励设计和超越平均后悔的评估来促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-Net是一个数据高效且可解释的队列长度估计框架，使用环线检测器计数和聚合浮动车数据，通过AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器在部分观测条件下稳健工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号交叉口队列长度估计在部分观测条件下具有挑战性，特别是当交通守恒假设被违反时，需要开发数据高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: Q-Net结合环线检测器计数和聚合浮动车数据，采用定制状态空间模型和AI增强的KalmanNet滤波器，无需先验噪声协方差或完整系统动态知识。

Result: 在鹿特丹主干道评估中，Q-Net在均方根误差上比基线方法提升超过60%，准确跟踪队列形成和消散，并校正aFCD引起的延迟。

Conclusion: Q-Net展示了强大的空间和时间可转移性，无需昂贵的传感基础设施，其实时变体有潜力集成到动态队列交通控制系统中。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Motivation: 探索在实用缩放配方下训练的LLM家族是否也存在损失曲线崩溃现象，以及这种现象对高效LLM开发的实际应用价值。

Method: 通过分析不同规模模型在最优超参数设置下的训练损失曲线，验证崩溃现象的存在，并开发基于偏离崩溃的诊断方法和早期停止策略。

Result: 证实损失曲线崩溃现象在实用缩放配方下依然存在，且与计算效率训练密切相关；开发了基于崩溃的诊断工具并成功训练了Celerity LLM家族。

Conclusion: 损失曲线崩溃是计算效率训练的重要特征，可作为开发高效LLM的有效工具，在训练诊断和超参数优化方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出用catnat函数替代softmax函数来处理深度学习中潜在类别变量，通过层次二值分割改善梯度下降效率，在多个任务中提升测试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中广泛存在潜在类别变量，但其离散性质给梯度下降学习带来挑战。现有改进梯度估计技术存在局限，需要从信息几何角度重新审视softmax函数。

Method: 提出catnat函数替代softmax，该函数由一系列层次二值分割组成，能够产生对角Fisher信息矩阵，从而显著改善梯度下降效率。

Result: 在图结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等实验中，catnat函数提高了学习效率，并产生具有更高测试性能的模型。

Conclusion: Catnat函数易于实现且与现有代码库兼容，与标准训练稳定技术保持兼容，是softmax函数的更好替代方案。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on
five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over
conventional black-box KD baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型存在模态对齐不充分的问题，某些模态可能未被有效对齐，导致模型在下游任务中无法充分利用多模态信息。

Method: 提出TRIANGLE相似度度量，直接在模态嵌入的高维空间中计算三角形面积相似度，替代对比损失中的余弦相似度，实现三个模态的联合对齐。

Result: 在视频-文本和音频-文本检索、音频-视频分类等三模态任务中，TRIANGLE取得了最先进的结果，相比基于余弦的方法Recall@1提升高达9个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIANGLE通过三角形面积相似度显著提升了多模态建模性能，同时提供了可解释的对齐依据，是改进多模态对齐的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

TL;DR: 提出SIREN方法解决强化学习中验证奖励的熵崩溃和过早收敛问题，通过选择性熵正则化在数学推理任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在大规模推理模型中失效，因为巨大的动作空间和长轨迹会导致全局熵爆炸，无法有效探索

Method: SIREN采用两步熵掩码机制：top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码，将正则化转换为自锚定形式以稳定训练

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN优于之前的熵相关RLVR方法，在AIME24/25上获得+6.6 maj@k提升，促进响应多样性并保持适当熵水平

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了RLVR在大规模推理模型中的过早收敛问题，保持验证pass@k在整个训练过程中的稳定性

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

Result: 在D4RL数据集上的广泛实验表明，RPEX在各种数据污染场景下实现了最先进的O2O性能

Conclusion: RPEX是一种新颖、简单而有效的方法，能够显著提升离线到在线强化学习在数据污染环境下的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Motivation: 当前神经网络方法需要为每个目标系统训练专门的MTPP模型，这限制了模型的通用性和效率。

Method: 基于摊销推理和上下文学习，在广泛的Hawkes过程分布生成的大规模合成数据集上预训练深度神经网络，使其能够从事件序列上下文中推断条件强度函数。

Result: 实验表明这种摊销方法在常见基准数据集上的下一事件预测性能与专门模型相当。

Conclusion: FIM-PP模型实现了MTPP推理的通用化，无需为每个系统单独训练模型，同时保持了预测性能。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有显著优势，CHARM方法具有很好的应用前景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大推理模型存在重复思维模式，但减少这些模式往往以性能下降为代价。本文旨在克服这种性能与效率之间的权衡。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，在压缩阶段限制最大推理长度迫使模型做出精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽长度限制让模型探索长时程规划，通过动态调整训练中的最大推理长度来实现。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时token使用减少46.9%，SIRI-high在所有方法中达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中周期性调整输出截断长度来动态平衡探索与效率，能够收敛到性能与效率之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Motivation: 传统分子动力学模拟计算成本高，现有生成模型学习固定滞后转移密度，训练信号被频繁但无信息的转移主导。

Method: 引入MSM Emulators类模型，特别是MarS-FM（Markov Space Flow Matching），基于马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转移采样。

Result: MarS-FM在结构观测指标（RMSD、回转半径、二级结构含量）上优于现有方法，在500个残基以内的蛋白质域上表现优异，支持展开事件建模。

Conclusion: MSM Emulators类模型，特别是MarS-FM，能够高效生成替代轨迹，在保持统计特性的同时大幅提升采样效率。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

TL;DR: Labyrinth是一个专为测试模仿学习泛化能力设计的基准环境，通过精确控制结构、起点终点位置和任务复杂度，支持可验证的不同训练、评估和测试设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习基准在训练和评估之间缺乏足够的变化，限制了有意义的泛化能力评估。

Method: 设计Labyrinth环境，提供离散、完全可观测的状态空间和已知最优动作，支持可解释性和细粒度评估。灵活设置允许针对性测试泛化因素，包括部分可观测性、钥匙门任务和冰面危险等变体。

Conclusion: Labyrinth通过支持受控、可复现的实验，推进了模仿学习中泛化能力的评估，并为开发更鲁棒的智能体提供了宝贵工具。

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between
training and evaluation, limiting meaningful generalisation assessment. We
introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation
with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task
complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test
settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known
optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its
flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.
By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the
evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool
for developing more robust agents.

*Felix Strnad,Jonathan Schmidt,Fabian Mockert,Philipp Hennig,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究分析了德国未来Dunkelflaute事件（低风能和太阳能发电期）的频率和持续时间，发现在SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下，这些事件的发生率和持续时间与历史时期相比基本保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架对CMIP6气候模拟进行降尺度处理，并与ERA5历史数据进行比较，评估未来Dunkelflaute事件在德国发生的可能性。

Result: 在乐观的低排放（SSP2-4.5）和高排放（SSP5-8.5）情景下，德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间在集合平均值中与历史时期相比基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，Dunkelflaute事件相关的风险预计在整个世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

TL;DR: 提出了Fidel-TS基准测试，通过从实时API获取数据构建，解决了现有时间序列预测基准测试中的数据污染和因果泄漏问题，证明了文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测性能提升的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测模型评估缺乏高质量基准测试，存在数据污染和因果泄漏等问题，导致进展的假象。

Method: 制定了高保真基准测试的核心原则（数据来源完整性、严格因果合理性、结构清晰性），并从实时API构建了Fidel-TS基准测试。

Result: 实验验证了该方法，揭示了先前基准测试的关键偏差和设计限制，并证明文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 构建高质量的基准测试对于准确评估时间序列预测模型至关重要，文本信息的因果相关性是实现真正性能提升的决定性因素。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

*Zixu Wang,Hongbin Dong,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DSAT-HD模型，通过混合分解机制、多尺度自适应路径和双流残差学习框架，解决了传统时间序列预测方法在捕获跨范围特征和处理复杂季节性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法主要建模有限时间序列或固定尺度，难以捕获不同范围的多样化特征；传统季节性分解方法需要预设季节周期且通常只能处理单一固定季节性。

Method: 1) 混合分解机制：结合EMA和傅里叶分解与RevIN归一化，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节和趋势分量；2) 多尺度自适应路径：使用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层，通过稀疏组合器合并特征，结合局部CNN和全局交互的混合注意力；3) 双流残差学习框架：CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节和趋势分量，通过最小化专家协作方差的平衡损失函数进行协调。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSAT-HD整体优于现有方法，并在某些数据集上达到最先进性能，同时在各种迁移场景中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解、多尺度自适应和双流学习框架，有效解决了时间序列预测中的复杂季节性和跨范围特征捕获问题，展现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Conclusion: 物理先验信息的正确对齐可以显著改善数据依赖情况下的学习性能，消除数据依赖带来的负面影响。

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

TL;DR: DyMoDreamer是一种新颖的基于模型的强化学习算法，通过动态调制机制改进动态特征提取，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习中的样本效率问题，传统世界模型无法有效分离动态对象和静态背景，导致计算效率低下，特别是在视觉任务中。

Method: 采用动态调制机制，通过帧间差分掩码提取差分观测，将动态调制建模为随机分类分布并集成到循环状态空间模型中。

Result: 在Atari 100k基准测试中达到156.6%的平均人类标准化分数，在DeepMind视觉控制套件中创下832的新记录，在Crafter基准测试中1M步后性能提升9.5%。

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过专注于奖励相关的动态特征，显著提高了基于模型强化学习的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Method: 整合单细胞基础模型的基因级嵌入与预训练大语言模型，构建多模态生成框架，将scRNA-seq数据转换为自然语言描述。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Motivation: 数字流媒体平台提供了结构化数据，为研究音乐流行度和主流成功开辟了新途径，探索决定歌曲能否进入Billboard Hot 100榜单的关键因素。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和梯度提升（XGBoost）等机器学习模型，分析流媒体流行度、音频信号属性和人类收听概率指标对榜单入选的预测能力。

Result: 逻辑回归准确率达90.0%，随机森林提升至90.4%，XGBoost为90.3%。流行度是最强预测因子，乐器度、情感效价、时长和言语度也有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 流行度是预测Billboard Hot 100入选的最决定性因素，结合音频特征和机器学习模型可以高精度预测歌曲的商业成功。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支神经网络架构，通过谱分支和图像分支的协同工作来改进PDE动力学学习，解决了现有注意力模型在全局耦合方面的不足，显著降低了误差并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要采用多尺度窗口自注意力机制，但由于其局部性，真正的全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐步传播，这削弱了全局耦合，导致闭环推演中的误差累积和漂移问题。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕获全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支专注于局部细节和非平稳结构。首先在低频范围内进行受控轻量混合，然后通过带权加权在每层融合谱路径和图像路径，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。融合结果转换回空间域并添加到图像分支中。

Result: 与强注意力基线相比，在相同训练设置和预算下，DRIFT-Net以更少的参数实现了更低的误差和更高的吞吐量。在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低了7%-54%，参数数量减少约15%，吞吐量仍高于scOT。

Conclusion: 消融研究和理论分析进一步证明了该设计的稳定性和有效性。DRIFT-Net通过双分支架构有效平衡了全局结构和局部细节，显著提升了PDE动力学学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Motivation: 在人类与机器学习系统协作中，不确定性量化至关重要，因为人类决策者会根据机器置信度调整决策。可靠校准的模型不确定性能够实现更有效的协作、针对性专家干预和更负责任的ML系统使用。

Method: 将保形预测框架应用于SoilNet多模态多任务土壤剖面模型，设计模拟人机协作标注流程，在模型不确定性高时使用有限预算获取领域专家的真实标注。

Result: 实验表明，保形化处理后的SoilNet在回归任务中实现了更高效的标注，在分类任务中在相同标注预算下保持了可比性能。

Conclusion: 保形预测能够有效校准SoilNet模型的不确定性，在有限标注预算下提升人机协作效率，特别是在回归任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Conclusion: 自适应正则化解决了传统正则化的不连续性问题，提供了更稳定和通用的等变机器学习框架。

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

Method: 使用平方根速度（SRV）表示和图形过滤方法，分析SCOP数据集中的不同类型蛋白质，研究ESM2模型中不同层的Karcher均值和有效维度变化。

Conclusion: 在PLMs接近最后一层之上训练折叠模型可能提高折叠性能，因为该层编码了最结构忠实的信息。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在抗体贝叶斯优化中融入结构信息的方法，发现某些结构信息在早期优化轮次中能提高稳定性优化的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。通过引入蛋白质语言模型的软约束，序列方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗体治疗特性的工程化通常需要迭代且昂贵的实验，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。但针对高度结构化的抗体空间，如何选择最佳代理模型以及是否必须使用结构信息尚不明确。

Method: 比较了融入结构信息的不同方法与纯序列方法在抗体结合亲和力和稳定性优化上的表现，并提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的软约束来引导优化过程。

Result: 某些结构信息在稳定性优化的早期阶段提高了数据效率，但峰值性能相同。加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，序列方法在亲和力优化上的数据效率差距缩小，在稳定性优化上完全消除，达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在贝叶斯优化中，序列方法配合适当的软约束可以达到与结构方法相当的性能，对在抗体优化中必须使用结构信息的必要性提出了质疑。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出OAT-FM方法，将流匹配与最优加速度传输理论结合，通过优化加速度传输而非恒定速度来改善流匹配性能，并提出了两阶段微调范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流匹配方法隐含了流直线化目标，这与最小化OAT定义的物理作用量在数学上等价。通过桥接流匹配和最优加速度传输理论，可以开发改进的流匹配方法。

Method: 提出OAT-FM方法，在样本和速度的乘积空间中优化加速度传输，其目标对应流直线性的充要条件。设计了低复杂度的算法实现OAT-FM，并提出了两阶段微调范式：先用任意流匹配方法训练生成模型，然后用OAT-FM进行微调。

Conclusion: OAT-FM通过桥接流匹配和最优加速度传输理论，提供了一种改进的流匹配方法，其两阶段微调范式能有效提升现有生成模型的性能。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种新的深度Q学习方法，通过正则化减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，使线性函数逼近在迁移学习中更有效，从而降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习训练需要大量超参数调优和高计算成本，迁移学习通过重用已有任务知识来避免从头训练。但标准深度RL模型学习到的表示可能高度相关，限制了线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的效果。

Method: 提出一种新颖的深度Q学习方法，引入正则化项来减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，利用这些低相关特征实现更有效的线性函数逼近迁移学习。

Result: 在标准RL基准测试和MinAtar游戏上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升迁移学习性能并减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过减少特征相关性，提出的方法能够更有效地利用线性函数逼近进行迁移学习，为解决深度RL训练挑战提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: DUCHESS是一个LLM服务系统，通过基于预测的分支编排来减少推理时计算成本，在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著降低token使用和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时算法（如思维链和多分支推理）虽然提高了准确性，但大幅增加了token使用和请求延迟。先前工作主要关注减少token使用，往往以牺牲准确性为代价，且忽视了其他延迟因素。

Method: DUCHESS采用轻量级线性探测模型基于LLM层激活来估计分支正确性，其编排策略决定终止、复制或继续分支。在多请求处理时，通过基于提示估计复杂度来优先处理较简单的推理任务。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS持续改进token-准确性Pareto边界，相比自一致性方法在相同准确性下减少42-63%的token使用。在vLLM服务中，使用FCFS调度时平均、中位数和尾部延迟分别减少57-81%、58-85%和52-84%。

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支编排有效平衡了LLM推理的准确性和效率，为实际部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠自适应正则化(OAR)方法，通过根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域提高CATE估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CATE元学习方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要改进在这些关键区域的估计性能。

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化(OAR)，根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化。该方法可应用于参数和非参数二阶模型，并提出了保持Neyman正交性的去偏版本。

Result: 通过(半)合成实验证明，与恒定正则化相比，OAR在低重叠设置下显著改善了CATE估计。

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习者正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能有效提升低重叠区域的CATE估计性能。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Motivation: 数据稀缺推动了对更高效样本利用的大语言模型的需求，需要系统比较不同模型的样本效率

Method: 利用双下降现象全面比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析在不同参数化状态下的表现

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化状态下，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失二次下降

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上更样本高效，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算资源时才能具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖复杂的策略优化框架，需要大量启发式技巧和精细调参，存在训练不稳定和多样性崩溃问题。研究发现数学推理任务具有特殊的MDP结构，可以简化现有方法。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，证明最优动作可以从固定均匀随机策略的Q函数中恢复，使用基于这些Q值的softmax采样动作，绕过了传统的策略迭代循环。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1 +8.2，pass@256 +16.8）和多样性（+17.6%）方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: ROVER是一个极简但高效的RL方法，通过利用数学推理任务的特殊结构，实现了比复杂现有方法更好的性能，同时保持了训练过程中的多样性。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为PPO提供超越有限维假设的更坚实理论基础，澄清RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家在何时能够实现全局策略改进和实际效率。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中解耦策略评估和改进：(1)核化TD评论家使用单步状态-动作转移样本进行高效RKHS梯度更新；(2)KL正则化的自然梯度策略步长对评估的动作值进行指数化，在连续空间中恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。

Result: 提供了非渐近、实例自适应的理论保证，收敛速率依赖于RKHS熵，统一了表格、线性、Sobolev、高斯和神经正切核等不同机制。经验表明，理论对齐的调度在常见控制任务中提高了稳定性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 该工作将PPO建立在更坚实的理论基础上，阐明了RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家能够实现全局策略改进的条件，并为连续状态-动作空间中的策略优化提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型可能无意中泄露训练样本的成员身份信息，这引发了严重的隐私担忧。需要从理论和实证角度研究基于分数的成员推断攻击。

Method: 提出SimA单查询攻击方法，利用扩散模型预测的噪声向量编码训练集邻近性的特性。通过分析去噪器输出的范数来揭示成员身份，相比多查询方法更高效。

Result: SimA在DDPM和LDM等多种扩散模型变体上表现一致强劲。发现潜在扩散模型由于潜在自动编码器的强信息瓶颈而比像素空间模型更安全。

Conclusion: 研究巩固了基于分数成员推断攻击的理论基础，同时强调需要更好地理解VAE反演而不仅仅是扩散过程反演，以增强潜在扩散模型的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，替代传统的token级链式思维，实现了更高效的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、推理被限制在离散token空间中、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，每个推理步骤对应内部思想的转换，显式推理步骤作为可观测变量。提出两阶段变分训练方案来解决潜在过程与监督学习不兼容的问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS超越了现有连续推理方法，首次达到与token级链式思维相当的性能，在GSM8K上甚至超出4.7%，推理速度提升高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS不仅实现了高效推理，还提供了步骤级而非token级的随机性控制，为强化学习和LLM推理开辟了重要机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

*Bingrui Li,Jiaxin Wen,Zhanpeng Zhou,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现了一种称为轨迹不变性的现象，通过结合学习率和权重衰减，将二维超参数空间简化为一维，提出了高效的调优规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超参数调优在大规模应用中成本越来越高，需要建立指导超参数调优的原则。

Method: 通过研究包括批量大小、学习率和权重衰减在内的多种超参数，识别出轨迹不变性现象，即预训练损失曲线、梯度噪声和梯度范数在结合学习率和权重衰减的某个量上表现出不变性。

Result: 轨迹不变性现象将原始二维超参数空间简化为一维，揭示了有效的调优方向，并改进了之前的缩放定律。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了高效调优的新原则，并为缩放定律的未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

*Shuchen Xue,Chongjian Ge,Shilong Zhang,Yichen Li,Zhi-Ming Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)方法，通过使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失函数来降低方差，并通过优势权重重新加权样本，实现了扩散模型预训练与强化学习的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型强化学习方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，增加了方差并减缓收敛。本文旨在统一预训练和强化学习的目标函数。

Method: AWM使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失函数，通过优势权重对样本进行重新加权，提升高奖励样本的影响并抑制低奖励样本。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO实现了高达24倍的加速，且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: AWM方法在理论上和实践上统一了扩散模型的预训练和强化学习，降低了方差，加速了收敛，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的OOD检测方法，通过估计联合似然来评估回归任务中AI预测的可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动模型在科学领域应用日益广泛，但在分布外数据上容易失败，而回归任务中的OOD检测仍是一个挑战

Method: 使用分数扩散模型估计联合似然，同时考虑输入和回归模型的预测，提供任务感知的可靠性评分

Result: 在多个科学数据集上的实验表明，该方法估计的似然与预测误差强相关

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建可验证的'信任证书'奠定了基础，为评估AI科学预测的可信度提供了实用工具

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督训练工作流，通过结合实验测量探针和程序生成合成物体来强调探针学习，使单个物理信息神经网络能够在多个光束线上重建未见实验，实现多探针泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线ptychography是数据密集型成像技术，需要实时反馈，但现有深度学习方法缺乏跨实验条件的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用无监督训练工作流，结合实验测量探针和程序生成合成物体进行探针学习，使用物理信息神经网络。

Result: 该方法实现了多探针泛化，重建保真度与仅使用实验数据训练的模型相当，即使改变合成训练物体类型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够训练实验引导模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线学习中的重放设置框架，分析了机器学习系统在自标注数据上训练时可能出现的错误强化问题。通过引入扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为可学习性的精确度量，证明了基于闭包的算法能够达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自标注数据上训练，它们可能会强化错误并成为自身信念的回音室。本文旨在建模和分析这种现象，为理解在这种重放设置下的学习能力提供理论基础。

Method: 提出了在线学习重放设置框架，引入了扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为新的复杂度度量。设计了基于闭包的学习算法，并证明了该算法在对抗性重放设置下的最优性。

Result: 证明了ExThD是重放设置下可学习性的精确度量：基于闭包的学习器最多犯ExThD(H)个错误，且没有算法能做得更好。对于随机对手，证明了类似的上界。

Conclusion: 重放设置比经典错误边界设置更难学习，某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的ExThD。适当学习表现出更尖锐的分离：一个类在重放下可适当学习当且仅当它（几乎）是交集闭包的。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

TL;DR: BALF是一个无需微调的神经网络压缩框架，通过激活感知因子分解和可扩展的预算秩分配器，在多种架构上实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络压缩方法需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，在普通硬件上不实用。受LLM压缩研究启发，开发无需微调的通用压缩方法。

Method: 提出激活感知因子分解框架，适用于多种层类型；引入可扩展预算秩分配器，灵活控制压缩目标且无额外开销。

Result: 在ResNet-20、ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器等多种架构上验证有效性，ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%时仅损失1%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了高效的模型压缩，在多种规模和架构上都取得了优异结果。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了注意力机制如何学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，从而检测弱、罕见且稀疏分布的特征。研究表明注意力分类器在信号强度仅需对数增长时就能达到消失的测试误差，而线性分类器需要平方根增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制何时以及如何学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，以检测弱、罕见且稀疏分布的特征。

Method: 在稀疏token分类模型中，使用简单的单层注意力分类器，在长序列极限和高维状态下分析其训练和性能。

Result: 注意力分类器在信号强度对数增长时就能达到消失的测试误差，仅需两次梯度更新就能使查询权重向量与隐藏信号对齐，产生选择性放大信息token的注意力图。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择在检测弱稀疏特征方面优于非自适应线性基线，解释了其优势来源。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型虽然能合成高质量样本，但经常违反物理定律或任务规范中的硬约束。现有投影方法会扭曲学习分布，多阶段方法则增加算法复杂度并累积误差。

Method: CCFM方法将随机优化集成到采样过程中，直接在噪声中间样本上操作，理论上等同于在干净样本定义的可行集上进行投影。

Result: 实验表明CCFM在建模偏微分方程控制的复杂物理系统和分子对接问题时，比现有约束生成模型具有更高的可行性和保真度。

Conclusion: CCFM能够在保证可行性的同时减轻分布扭曲，提供了一种有效的约束生成模型解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Conclusion: 物理信息策略能够显著提升图神经网络在配电网电压预测中的泛化能力和可靠性，为实际应用提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

TL;DR: GLASS Flows提出了一种新的采样范式，通过在流匹配模型内部模拟另一个流匹配模型来采样马尔可夫转移，结合ODE的高效性和SDE的随机演化，消除了推理时效率与随机性之间的权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 现有奖励对齐算法在推理时依赖SDE采样，效率低下且性能较差，而ODE采样虽然高效但缺乏随机演化能力。需要一种能结合两者优势的采样方法。

Method: 提出GLASS Flows采样范式，从预训练模型中检索"内部"流匹配模型，无需重新训练，实现ODE效率与SDE随机演化的结合。

Result: 在大规模文生图模型上，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，结合Feynman-Kac Steering实现了最先进的文生图性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型提供了一种简单、即插即用的推理时扩展解决方案，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Motivation: 现有的基于随机最优控制的强化学习方法在扩散模型微调中容易强化产生低奖励的次优轨迹，需要克服这一挑战。

Result: 在生物序列扩散模型的单目标和多目标微调任务中验证了TR2-D2框架的有效性。

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散序列生成中的奖励引导微调提供了一种可靠的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

Abstract: We consider a classic many-to-one matching setting, where participants need
to be assigned to teams based on the preferences of both sides. Unlike most of
the matching literature, we aim to provide fairness not only to participants,
but also to teams using concepts from the literature of fair division. We
present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation satisfying
team-justified envy-freeness up to one participant, participant-justified
envy-freeness, balancedness, Pareto optimality, and group-strategyproofness for
participants, even in the possible presence of ties. Our algorithm generalizes
both the Gale-Shapley algorithm from two-sided matching as well as the
round-robin algorithm from fair division. We also discuss how our algorithm can
be extended to accommodate quotas and incomplete preferences.

Conclusion: 在有限代理人经济中，成本分摊均衡可以通过大联盟的否决权来完全特征化，为公共产品经济均衡分析提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: This paper examines the characterizations of equilibrium in economies with
public projects. Public goods, as discussed by Mas-Colell (1980), are modeled
as elements of an abstract set lacking a unified ordering structure. We
introduce the concepts of cost share equilibrium for such economies, where the
private commodity space is a (possibly nonseparable) Banach lattice. Within
this framework, we present two distinct characterizations of cost share
equilibria via the veto power of the grand coalition in economies featuring
finitely many agents. The first characterization involves allocations that are
Aubin non-dominated, while the second establishes that an allocation is a cost
share equilibrium if and only if it cannot be dominated by the grand coalition,
where domination is considered under specific perturbations of initial
endowments.

Conclusion: 紧致性在不损失最优性的前提下改进了效率概念，能够复制Border和Sobel(1987)及Chander和Wilde(1998)的洞见，并为连续类型空间下的机制设计提供了实用方法。

Abstract: This note applies tightness (Kattwinkel and Preusser (2025)) to the setting
of Border and Sobel (1987, "Samurai Accountant: A Theory of Auditing and
Plunder"). Border and Sobel characterize efficient mechanisms and argue that
efficiency entails no loss of optimality. We characterize tight mechanisms and
argue that tightness entails no loss of optimality. We show that tight
mechanisms form a subset of efficient mechanisms. Therefore, tightness refines
efficiency without loss of optimality. By characterizing tight mechanisms, one
can replicate the insights from Border and Sobel (1987) and Chander and Wilde
(1998). A novel insight is how and in which order the principal uses different
instruments to provide incentives to different agent types. Further, we
describe a procedure for constructing efficient mechanisms in a setting with a
continuum of types.

### [500] [Terrorism & Democracy in Burkina-Faso](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23046)
*P Carmel Marie Zagre*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 恐怖袭击显著增加民众对威权政体的支持，减少对民主治理的支持，在安全与自由之间引发权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究恐怖主义在脆弱民主国家中对公众政治偏好的影响，特别是对民主支持度和威权替代方案的态度变化

Method: 结合ACLED地理定位恐怖事件数据（2015-2024）和Afrobarometer民意调查数据，比较成功恐怖袭击对公众政治偏好的影响

Result: 成功恐怖袭击显著增加对军事政权、一人统治和一党制的支持，减少对民主治理的支持，这种变化在袭击后立即显现并持续存在

Conclusion: 恐怖主义削弱民主韧性，加速威权倾向，侵蚀公民自由和行动自由等关键民主价值观的认知

Abstract: This article examines the political consequences of terrorism in Burkina
Faso. Using a dataset combining geolocated terrorist events from ACLED (from
2015 to 2024) with public opinion data from Afrobarometer, I compare the effect
of successful terrorist attacks on public support for democracy and
authoritarian alternatives. The results reveal that successful terrorist
attacks significantly increase support for military regimes, one man regimes,
and one party systems, while decreasing support for democratic governance.
These changes are most pronounced immediately after the attacks and persist
over time. This suggests that terrorism has triggered a trade-off in public
preferences between security and freedom. The study also reveals that terrorism
erodes perceptions of key democratic values, particularly civil liberties and
freedom of movement. Robustness tests confirm that weak institutions or a lack
of political knowledge are not driving the results. The article highlights how
terrorism in fragile democracies can undermine democratic resilience and
accelerate authoritarian drift.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 企业亏损显著压缩CSR披露多样性，外部媒体监督和内部治理机制能缓解这种负面效应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究财务困境如何影响企业非财务信息披露的结构多样性，特别是CSR披露的广度与韧性

Method: 使用LDA主题模型提取CSR报告主题，采用Gini-Simpson指数和Shannon熵量化披露多样性，通过回归分析检验企业亏损对CSR多样性的影响

Result: 企业亏损显著降低CSR主题多样性，媒体关注度、高管薪酬激励和监事会持股等治理机制能缓解这种负面效应，结果在工具变量估计、倾向得分匹配和安慰剂检验中保持稳健

Conclusion: 财务困境对非财务信息披露具有结构性影响，研究为优化CSR沟通、完善评级机构评估框架和设计多元化披露标准提供了实践启示

Abstract: The diversity of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure is a
crucial dimension of corporate transparency, reflecting the breadth and
resilience of a firm's social responsibility. Using CSR reports of Chinese
A-share firms from 2006 to 2023, this paper applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) to extract topics and quantifies disclosure diversity using the
Gini-Simpson index and Shannon entropy. Regression results show that corporate
losses significantly compress CSR topic diversity, consistent with the slack
resources hypothesis. Both external and internal governance mechanisms mitigate
this effect: higher media attention, stronger executive compensation
incentives, and greater supervisory board shareholding attenuate the
loss-diversity penalty. Results are robust to instrumental variables
estimation, propensity score matching, and placebo tests. Heterogeneity
analyses indicate weaker effects in firms with third-party assurance, those
disclosing work safety content, large firms, and those in less competitive
industries. Our study highlights the structural impact of financial distress on
non-financial disclosure and provides practical implications for optimizing CSR
communication, refining evaluation frameworks for rating agencies, and
designing diversified disclosure standards.

Motivation: 研究环境条件（特别是阳光效率）如何通过情感和认知机制影响政府信任，探讨环境因素在政治信任形成中的作用。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查第7波数据与NASA POWER高频天气数据相结合，提出并验证"显著性和归因"机制，识别主观幸福感、政治兴趣、政治讨论和健康感知等中介路径。

Result: 晴朗天气可能通过提高环境意识和触发负面归因而降低政府信任，环境条件还会在基于调查的信任指标中引入测量误差。

Conclusion: 研究为环境心理学、行为政治经济学和调查方法学提供了理论贡献，对治理、政策设计和调查实践具有实际意义。

Abstract: Government trust, as a core concept in political economy and public policy
research, serves as a fundamental cornerstone of democratic legitimacy and
state capacity. This paper examines how environmental conditions, particularly
sunlight efficiency, influence reported government trust through both affective
and cognitive mechanisms. Leveraging World Values Survey Wave 7 data merged
with NASA POWER high-frequency weather data, we propose and validate a novel
``salience and attribution'' mechanism: clearer skies may paradoxically reduce
government trust by heightening environmental awareness and triggering negative
attributions. We further identify potential mediating pathways, including
subjective well-being, political interest, political discussion, and health
perception, and demonstrate that environmental conditions introduce measurement
error in survey-based trust indicators. Our findings provide theoretical
contributions to environmental psychology, behavioral political economy, and
survey methodology, and yield practical implications for governance, policy
design, and survey

### [503] [Unintended Consequences of Early Driving Access: Evidence from Graduated Driver Licensing Policies and Adolescent Health Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23578)
*Sharareh Massahi*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究发现允许16岁以下青少年获得学习驾照虽然降低了交通事故死亡率，但显著增加了15-19岁女性青少年的药物相关死亡率和心理健康相关死亡率，揭示了驾照政策在保护青少年交通安全的同时可能在其他健康领域产生意外风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估分级驾照系统对青少年健康的多方面影响，特别关注早期驾驶许可可能产生的意外健康后果，填补了现有研究主要关注交通安全效益而忽略其他健康风险的空白。

Method: 利用1999-2020年美国各州驾照政策差异，采用双重差分分析方法，首次提供了早期驾驶许可对女性青少年健康风险的因果证据。

Result: 允许16岁前获得学习驾照的州，女性青少年药物相关死亡率显著增加1.331/10万，心理健康相关死亡率增加0.760/10万，而车辆死亡人数下降0.656/10万。这些影响解释了研究期间青少年药物死亡率上升的近三分之一和心理健康死亡率上升的十分之一。

Conclusion: 驾照政策的成本效益评估需要重新审视，揭示了保护青少年某一领域安全的干预措施可能在其他领域产生风险。建议通过加强监管、地理限制和心理健康整合等措施，在保持交通安全收益的同时减轻意外伤害。

Abstract: Graduated driver licensing systems effectively reduce adolescent traffic
fatalities but create unintended health consequences. Using state-level
variation in licensing policies from 1999-2020 and difference-in-differences
analysis, we provide the first causal evidence that early driving access
generates significant health risks for female adolescents aged 15-19. States
allowing learner's permits before age 16 experienced sharp increases in
drug-related mortality (+1.331 per 100,000, p<0.001) and mental health-related
mortality (+0.760, p<0.001), even as vehicle deaths declined (-0.656, p<0.05).
These effects explain nearly one-third of rising adolescent drug mortality and
one-tenth of mental health mortality increases over the study period. Early
driving access expands geographic reach, enabling contact with illicit drug
markets previously inaccessible to adolescents. It broadens social networks,
increasing exposure to high-risk peers, while vehicles provide unsupervised
spaces for experimentation. Premature independence also intensifies
psychological stress during critical developmental stages. Nationally, results
correspond to approximately 138 additional drug deaths and 79 mental health
deaths annually among female adolescents, imposing over $2 billion in mortality
costs yearly. These findings fundamentally reshape cost-benefit assessments of
licensing policies, revealing how interventions protecting adolescents in one
domain can create risks in others. Evidence-based modifications including
enhanced supervision, geographic restrictions, and mental health integration
could preserve traffic safety gains while mitigating unintended harms. This
research demonstrates the critical need for multi-outcome policy evaluation
that captures both benefits and hidden costs of expanded adolescent
independence.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Restrepo(2025)的AGI经济增长模型，引入莫拉维克悖论，证明当物理任务构成经济瓶颈时，劳动收入份额会收敛于正值而非零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI增长模型未充分考虑莫拉维克悖论——即感觉运动技能任务相比认知任务计算成本更高，这会影响收入分配预测。

Method: 将任务空间划分为认知和物理组件，设置不同的自动化成本，允许某些物理瓶颈具有无限计算成本。

Result: 当物理任务构成经济瓶颈且计算要求足够高时，在有限计算资源下，劳动收入份额收敛于正常数而非零。

Conclusion: 莫拉维克悖论从根本上改变了AGI的分配影响，同时保持了认知密集型经济的增长动态。

Abstract: This note extends Restrepo (2025)'s model of economic growth under AGI by
incorporating Moravec's Paradox -the observation that tasks requiring
sensorimotor skills remain computationally expensive relative to cognitive
tasks. We partition the task space into cognitive and physical components with
differential automation costs, allowing infinite costs for some physical
bottlenecks. Our key result shows that when physical tasks constitute economic
bottlenecks with sufficiently high (or infinite) computational requirements,
the labor share of income converges to a positive constant in the
finite-compute regime (rather than zero). This fundamentally alters the
distributional implications of AGI while preserving the growth dynamics for
cognitive-intensive economies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拉丁美洲学生基础能力不达标率高，加上结构性不平等和疫情后学习损失加剧，需要识别低学业表现学生的关键决定因素。

Method: 基于PISA 2022数据，使用SHAP可解释机器学习方法分析10个国家学生表现的决定因素。

Result: 发现语言少数群体、留级、家庭贫困、缺乏数字设备、工作负担以及学校环境差是低学业表现的主要因素，各国模式相对一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果为识别和帮助拉丁美洲教育系统中最弱势学生提供了策略依据。

Abstract: The high prevalence of students not achieving the basic competencies in Latin
America is concerning. Even more so given the region's deep structural
inequalities and the larger post-pandemic regional learning losses. Within this
scenario, this paper contributes to the identification of the determinants of
bottom and low performers (below level 2) using recent advancements on
explainable machine learning methods. In particular, relying on PISA 2022 data
for 10 countries and using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, I
identify critical factors impacting on the student performance across low
performers groups. I find that a student with the highest probability of being
a not achiever speaks a minority language and had repeated, has no digital
devices at home, comes from a poor family and works for payment half of the
week, and the school he/she attends has wide disadvantages such as bad school
climate, weak ICT infrastructure and poor teaching quality (only a third of
teachers being certified). Regarding countries' estimates, I find quite
homogeneous patterns as far as global average contribution of top ranked
factors is concerned, with repetition at primary, household wealth, and
educational ICT inputs being top ten ranked covariates in at least 8 out of the
10 total countries. The paper findings contribute to the broad literature on
strategies to identify and to target those most left behind in Latin American
education systems.

Motivation: 拉丁美洲地区存在学习危机，特别是在疫情后不平等对学业成就的影响加剧。研究学生学业韧性及其决定因素对政策制定具有重要意义。

Method: 采用可解释机器学习方法（SHAP方法），基于PISA 2022数据对拉丁美洲9个国家进行分析，使用多种指标识别学业韧性的关键因素。

Result: 发现家庭资源（书籍和数字设备）、性别、作业、留级和工作强度是学业韧性的重要因素；学校层面的因素如学校规模、网络连接比例、师生比、教学质量（认证教师和专业发展率）和学校类型（私立学校）也起关键作用。学校关闭时间和远程学习障碍与学业韧性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果填补了该地区稀缺的文献，并为未来政策设计提供了依据，可以利用学业韧性的关键特征帮助弱势学生从低成就群体转变为学业韧性学生。

Abstract: The learning crisis in the Latin American region (i.e., higher rates of
students not reaching basic competencies at secondary level) is worrying,
particularly post-pandemic given the stronger role of inequality behind
achievement. Within this scenario, the concept of student academic resilience
(SAR), students who despite coming from disadvantaged backgrounds reach good
performance levels, and an analysis of its determinants, are policy relevant.
In this paper, using advancements on explainable machine learning methods (the
SHAP method) and relying on PISA 2022 data for 9 countries from the region, I
identify leading factors behind SAR using diverse indicators. I find that
household inputs (books and digital devices), gender, homework, repetition and
work intensity are leading factors for one indicator of academic resilience,
whereas for other indicator leading drives fall into the school domain: school
size, the ratio of PC connected to the internet, STR and teaching quality
proxied by certified teachers and professional development rates and school
type (private school). Also, I find negative associations of SAR with the
length of school closures and barriers for remote learning during the pandemic.
The paper's findings adds to the scare regional literature as well as they
contribute to future policy designs where key features behind SAR can be used
to lift disadvantaged students from lower achievement groups towards being
academic resilient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NFT市场中视觉特征和市场周期对价格的共同影响，填补了数字艺术资产定价中视觉特征量化分析和市场动态研究的空白。

Method: 使用94,039笔交易数据，提取196个图像特征，采用三阶段筛选过程识别稳定预测因子，建立静态混合效应模型和贝叶斯动态混合效应面板模型进行分析。

Result: 发现市场情绪和可解释图像特征都有显著定价能力，其中高饱和度、构图集中度和曲度获得溢价，而杂乱、粗线条和分散调色板被折价。动态模型显示定价效应在市场扩张期更强，在衰退期减弱或为负。

Conclusion: NFT价格同时反映可观察的数字产品特征和市场周期，该框架为数字艺术市场的资产定价、平台策略和市场设计提供了周期感知工具。

Abstract: This paper studies how visual traits and market cycles shape prices in NFT
markets. Using 94,039 transactions from 26 major generative Ethereum
collections, the analysis extracts 196 machine-quantified image features
(covering color, composition, palette structure, geometry, texture, and deep
learning embeddings), then applies a three-stage filter process to identify
stable predictors for hedonic regression. A static mixed-effects model shows
that market sentiment and transparent, interpretable image traits have
significant and independent pricing power: higher focal saturation,
compositional concentration, and curvature are rewarded, while clutter, heavy
line work, and dispersed palettes are discounted; deep embeddings add limited
incremental value conditional on explicit traits. To assess state dependence,
the study estimates a Bayesian dynamic mixed-effects panel with cycle effects
and time-varying coefficients for a salient image attribute (Composition Focus
- Saturation). Collection-level heterogeneity ("brand premia") is absorbed by
random effects. The time-varying coefficients exhibit regime sensitivity, with
stronger premia in expansionary phases and weaker or negative loadings in
downturns, while grand-mean effects remain small on average. Overall, NFT
prices reflect both observable digital product characteristics and market
regimes, and the framework offers a cycle-aware tool for asset pricing,
platform strategy, and market design in digital art markets.

Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何影响劳动力市场信号传递，特别是AI写作工具对求职信作为能力信号的作用。

Method: 使用Freelancer.com上AI求职信写作工具的引入作为自然实验，采用双重差分法分析工具使用对求职信匹配度和面试率的影响。

Result: AI工具提高了求职信匹配度和面试率，但使求职信作为能力信号的价值下降51%，雇主转向过往评价等其他信号。

Conclusion: AI工具虽然提升了求职信质量，但削弱了其信号价值，导致劳动力市场信号体系发生转变。

Abstract: We study how generative AI affects labor market signaling using the
introduction of an AI-powered cover letter writing tool on Freelancer.com. Our
data track both access to the tool and usage at the application level.
Difference-in-differences estimates show that access to the AI tool increased
textual alignment between cover letters and job posts--which we refer to as
cover letter tailoring--and raised callback likelihoods. Workers with weaker
pre-AI writing skills saw larger improvements in cover letters, indicating that
AI substitutes for workers' own skills. Although only a minority of
applications used the tool, the overall correlation between cover letter
tailoring and callbacks fell by 51%, implying that cover letters became less
informative signals of worker ability in the age of AI. Employers
correspondingly shifted toward alternative signals, such as workers' past
reviews, which became more predictive of hiring. Finally, within the treated
group, greater time spent editing AI drafts was associated with higher hiring
success.

Method: 比较分析土耳其和埃及的案例，关注新自由主义重组中劳动力市场的变化，特别是对持不同政见工会的强制措施和威权法团主义关系

Result: 新自由主义在这些国家的经验表明，经济自由化并未带来政治民主化，而是通过强制措施瓦解异见工会力量，并通过威权法团主义关系控制其他有组织劳工

Conclusion: 土耳其和埃及的新自由主义经验挑战了经济自由化必然导致政治民主化的传统观点，展示了威权主义如何与新自由主义政策共存

Abstract: This article analyses the trajectories of organised labour in times of
neoliberalism in Turkey and Egypt and their current condition under securitised
neoliberal-developmentalist regimes post-2013. Neoliberal experience in these
countries was marked by continuing authoritarianism, challenging the view that
economic liberalisation would lead to political democratisation. One of the
most important areas of neoliberal restructuring has been labour markets. In
order to achieve this, struggles over organised labour were of vital
importance. Dismantling the power of dissident labour unions through coercive
measures and containing other sections of organised labour through
authoritarian corporatist relations has been crucial in these cases.

Motivation: 当前视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，虽然在特定领域能取得改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 提出MoVT范式，引入AdaVaR两阶段学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过RL过程（使用AdaGRPO算法）诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域应用增加，理解其潜在病态决策行为具有实际意义，需要评估AI在金融应用中的安全性。

Method: 使用老虎机实验系统分析LLM决策行为，通过稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析，研究认知行为层面和神经层面的决策机制。

Result: 在老虎机实验中观察到人类赌博成瘾的认知特征，自主设定目标和投注大小时破产率显著上升，神经分析显示模型行为由抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化人类认知偏见和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，强调了金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证的智能框架，通过整合通用LLM、专业证明LLM、形式验证器和语义定理检索器，显著提升了数学问题解决能力，在多个基准测试中达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专业证明LLM在形式语言中解决问题的能力远低于通用LLM在自然语言中的表现，需要弥合非正式推理与形式证明生成之间的差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题拆分为子目标，结合通用LLM的推理能力和专业证明LLM的Lean 4战术生成能力，利用验证器反馈修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题(70.0%)，优于SeedProver(50.4%)，比最佳基线提升422%。

Conclusion: Hilbert框架有效缩小了非正式推理与形式证明生成之间的差距，证明了结合不同组件优势的智能系统在数学问题解决中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来确定何时以及如何将从一个模型实例的发现推广到其他模型，这构成了基本认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制声明可推广性的对应轴：功能、发展、位置、关系和配置对应，并在Pythia模型系列中实证分析1-back注意力头的发展轨迹。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将大语言模型的设计属性与其涌现行为和机制对应起来。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入到共享空间中，通过几何交互确定正确性，取代全局排名，支持泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估实践将多样能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维性质，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 使用几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，问题嵌入的方向编码语义，范数编码难度，正确性由模型和问题嵌入的几何交互决定。

Result: 实验结果显示：分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释；较大范数一致表示更难的问题；支持泛化，新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入；揭示的LLM内部分类与人类定义类别部分对齐。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一且可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，通过提炼可重用的解题策略来动态提升弱模型性能，减少对昂贵模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联系统在遇到相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本过高。需要一种能够在线学习并减少对强模型依赖的方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为通用的可重用解题策略。这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态提升性能，无需耗时耗力的微调。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升了弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统性能（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少了强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）和相应费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识迁移，为开源和API-based LLMs提供了一个通用、可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于贝叶斯说服理论的可扩展框架，用于评估和训练LLM的说服能力。研究发现前沿模型能获得高说服收益并展现复杂策略，通过强化学习训练后，即使是小模型也能显著提升说服效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM展现出与人类相当的说服能力，既带来益处也引发社会担忧。但由于人类说服效果在不同领域差异很大，系统评估LLM说服能力具有挑战性。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有人类-人类说服数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLM进行战略说服。

Result: 前沿模型能持续获得高说服收益，并展现出与理论预测一致的说服策略。通过强化学习训练后，即使是小型LLM也能显著提高说服收益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展的原则性框架来评估LLM说服能力，证明了强化学习能有效提升LLM的战略说服能力，为理解和控制LLM说服行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现代科学中，符号回归等方法虽然能拟合可解释模型，但这些模型往往与现有理论不符。当新数据和假设与现有理论不一致时，需要自动化推理来弥补这一差距。

Method: 使用代数几何方法，给定不完整的公理系统和无法解释的假设，自动生成最小缺失公理集，前提是公理和假设可表示为多项式方程。

Result: 建立了成功检索此类公理的充分必要条件，并通过解释开普勒第三定律等案例展示了方法的有效性，即使在关键公理缺失的情况下也能工作。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化科学推理提供了一种新途径，能够处理现有理论不完整或错误的情况，通过代数几何技术填补理论空白。

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Method: 引入创造性对抗测试（CAT）框架，通过模拟Alexa+音频服务的合成交互数据进行广泛验证，这种方法既能全面测试边缘情况和故障模式，又能保护用户隐私。

Result: CAT框架在目标-任务对齐分析方面提供了前所未有的洞察力，能够更有效地优化和开发Agentic AI系统。

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI评估中的关键空白，为理解和改进Agentic AI系统的目标-任务对齐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia是一个简化的四人版社交推理游戏，用于评估大型语言模型的社会智能。通过角色特定的获胜条件（黑手党欺骗、村民识破欺骗、侦探有效披露信息）来测量三种交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑手党游戏的信息不对称和心智理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，为评估LLM的社会智能提供了有用的测试平台。

Method: 引入Mini-Mafia：简化四人变体（1黑手党、1侦探、2村民），设置单日讨论和投票阶段。创建Mini-Mafia基准测试框架，让LLM相互对战，通过固定对手配置估计胜率并标准化评分。

Result: 实验揭示了反直觉结果，包括较小模型在某些情况下优于较大模型。基准测试还支持对涌现的多智能体动态进行定量研究，如姓名偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅作为基准测试工具，还通过生成欺骗检测训练数据和跟踪模型欺骗能力，为AI安全做出贡献。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出Agentless训练方法可以产生结构化技能先验，使SWE-Agent能够高效适应。通过Kimi-Dev模型在SWE-bench上达到60.4%的验证性能，并通过少量轨迹微调使SWE-Agent达到48.6%的pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SWE解决方案分为多轮交互的SWE-Agent框架和单轮可验证步骤的Agentless方法，作者认为这两种范式并不互斥，Agentless训练产生的技能先验可以支持高效的SWE-Agent适应。

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方法，开发Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行SFT微调，使模型能够适应SWE-Agent框架。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%的性能，是工作流方法中最佳表现。经过微调后，SWE-Agent达到48.6%的pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: Agentless训练产生的结构化技能先验可以桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在不确定性决策中的风险特征，以及提示工程和对齐方法如何影响其风险行为，现有研究主要关注个性提示或多智能体交互，缺乏对后训练影响的研究。

Method: 提出基于行为经济学和金融学工具的新流程，使用效用理论模型比较预训练、指令微调和RLHF对齐的LLM，评估提示工程、上下文学习和后训练等调节策略。

Result: 指令微调模型表现出与标准效用公式一致的行为，预训练和RLHF对齐模型偏离拟合的效用模型，后训练提供了最稳定有效的风险偏好调节。

Conclusion: 揭示了不同类别和阶段LLM的风险特征，证明后训练能有效调节风险偏好，为行为对齐和风险感知LLM设计奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法和双玩家Nash学习方法无法充分捕捉现实世界偏好的复杂结构，特别是非传递性和异质性特征，存在单对手偏见的问题。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n玩家博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。建立了多玩家设置中的Nash均衡，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: 在指令遵循基准测试中，MNPO始终优于现有的NLHF基线方法，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐具有复杂非传递性人类偏好的大语言模型提供了一个原则性且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统上，大型语言模型在训练数据包含的任务和纯语言任务上表现最佳，这限制了对其新兴复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能完成认知心理学中认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进的纯文本LLMs，然后建立人类基线（100名被试），最后测试不同推理级别的推理模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平，推理模型在分配更多推理token时表现最强，表明LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力。

Conclusion: 研究证明最佳LLMs具有完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性的，这重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成长期被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

TL;DR: AttAnchor是一个参数自由的框架，通过将语义相似的跨模态token分组，改善视觉语言模型中的跨模态局部性，减少幻觉并提高任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖图像和文本token的直接拼接，导致跨模态语义相关token之间的注意力距离过长，这是模型产生幻觉和性能不佳的主要原因。

Method: 提出Attention Anchor框架，将文本token插入到相关的视觉patch附近，创建语义路标，引导模型关注正确的图像区域，实现跨模态token的联合聚类。

Result: 在15个不同指标和基准测试中，13个获得改进，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越更大的LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B模型。

Conclusion: AttAnchor通过高效的跨模态token分组机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能和可靠性，是首个研究混合模态token联合聚类的工作。

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Method: 系统评估LLM系统架构（单LLM vs 多LLM）、输入表示（原始数据 vs 描述性统计）和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供汇总统计输入时表现最佳；多LLM系统使用专门提示在故障分类方面比单LLM系统具有更高的灵敏度；但LLM在持续学习环境中难以适应和校准预测。

Conclusion: LLM系统作为透明、自适应诊断工具在复杂环境中既有前景也存在当前局限性，特别是在持续学习能力方面需要改进。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

TL;DR: SysMoBench是一个用于评估AI为大型复杂系统生成形式化模型能力的基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+作为规范语言，包含9个系统组件并自动化评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定大型复杂计算机系统及其正确性验证至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI工作主要针对小型代码而非完整系统，需要评估AI是否能处理真实系统组件并将其复杂行为属性抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 创建SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+作为规范语言，自动化评估指标包括语法和运行时正确性、与系统代码的一致性以及不变量正确性。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含9个多样化系统组件，如Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS中的自旋锁和互斥锁等，并正在积极添加更多组件。

Conclusion: SysMoBench能够帮助我们理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限性，为该领域工具奠定坚实基础并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

TL;DR: MathBode是一种针对大语言模型数学推理的动态诊断方法，通过正弦驱动参数变化并分析模型输出的频率响应，提供增益和相位等可解释指标，揭示标准准确率无法发现的系统性推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法捕捉大语言模型在数学推理中的动态行为和系统性缺陷，需要更精细的诊断工具来揭示模型推理的一致性和保真度。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率解析指标，形成Bode图式指纹。

Result: 在五个闭式问题族上，诊断揭示了系统性低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些现象被准确率评估所掩盖。与符号基线的比较显示前沿模型与中端模型在动态特性上的明显差异。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一种紧凑、可复现的协议，补充了标准基准测试，能够有效测量推理的保真度和一致性，为模型评估提供了新的维度。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了热力学协调理论(TCT)，揭示了多智能体协调中的基本热力学约束，表明协调协议需要激进的信息损失，并推导了协调协议的最小描述长度公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调过程的基本热力学约束，解释为什么最大效用的协调解需要更高的可发现性而非准确性，以及为什么协调会导致信息损失。

Method: 使用信息论方法推导协调协议的最小描述长度公式，引入协调温度概念来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本来分析偏好聚合问题。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量、目标冲突和精度要求呈多项式增长，协调过程会产生持久亚稳态和滞后现象，需要环境显著变化才能触发相变。

Conclusion: 协调本质上需要激进的信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的无限循环和大型语言模型中的对齐伪装现象，为理解复杂系统中的协调机制提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Motivation: 当前Wi-Fi系统使用的二进制指数退避机制在密集部署中存在碰撞解决效率低下和公平性挑战，无法满足新兴应用对可靠性的严格要求。

Method: 开发动态退避选择机制，结合集中训练分散执行架构，使用约束多智能体近端策略优化算法，整合邻域活动模式作为观测输入。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比传统BEB机制，该方案显著降低碰撞概率，同时保持与商用Wi-Fi设备的向后兼容性，公平性指标有效消除异构场景中的饥饿风险。

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架为未授权频段的分布式信道接入提供了根本性改进，在保持兼容性的同时提升了系统性能和公平性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究多令牌预测(MTP)范式如何帮助大语言模型学习传递关系，提出理论分析并改进策略，显著提升了模型在路径规划任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂规划任务中难以学习传递关系，这是复杂规划的关键基础。为解决这一瓶颈问题，研究者探索了MTP范式对传递关系学习的影响。

Method: 使用包含共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构进行理论分析，提出两种改进策略：下一令牌注入(NTI)和基于Transformer的传递层，并在合成图和Blocksworld规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 分析表明传递层逐渐学习多步邻接信息，使骨干模型能够捕捉训练数据中未观察到的传递可达关系。改进策略显著增强了模型的路径规划能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对Transformer在MTP下学习复杂规划任务的理解，提供了克服传递性瓶颈的实用策略，为构建结构感知的通用规划模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于学习的超参数配置方法存在样本复杂度高和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种无需训练且能有效利用实时反馈的自动化方法。

Method: 采用两个核心组件：在线探索性景观分析模块提供实时搜索动态反馈，多LLM推理链解释反馈并生成自适应超参数策略。

Result: 在多种组合优化基准测试中，AutoEP持续优于最先进的调优器，包括神经进化和其他基于LLM的方法，且开源模型能达到GPT-4的性能水平。

Conclusion: AutoEP展示了一种强大且易于访问的自动化超参数设计新范式，通过将高层推理与实证数据相结合来缓解幻觉问题。

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务类型和温度配置影响较大，需要一种更鲁棒的采样策略

Method: 基于信息论的p-less采样方法，根据完整的token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需人工设置超参数

Result: 在数学推理、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样优于现有方法，在高温下文本质量下降更少，推理效率更高

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效且高效的解码策略，无需超参数调优，在各种任务和温度设置下都能保持稳定的高质量输出

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)的设计空间，提出了混合数据合成框架和感知聚焦监督方法，在多个多模态基准测试中验证了VL-PRMs在提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性方面的有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号且跨任务泛化能力有限，需要探索更有效的VL-PRMs设计方法。

Method: 提出了混合数据合成框架(结合MCTS和强VLM判断)、感知聚焦监督方法(显式检测视觉基础阶段的错误)，并系统评估了多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试上的实验表明：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现更优；小模型能匹配甚至超越大模型；VL-PRMs能发掘强VLM的潜在推理能力；感知级监督带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: VL-PRMs能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，本文工作为VLMs的进一步发展提供了重要支持和研究方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，标准流程奖励模型在处理密集的人工输入和长历史数据时会出现'中间迷失'现象，且缺乏对GUI动态变化的感知能力。

Method: 提出GUI-PRA，包含动态内存机制（基于相关性的检索模块和渐进式摘要模块）和自适应UI感知机制，能够智能处理历史上下文并主动感知UI状态变化。

Result: GUI-PRA能够更好地提供流程奖励，通过相关检索和动态摘要确保模型关注相关上下文，并通过工具选择获取接地气的视觉证据来支持评估。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过解决历史上下文处理和UI变化感知两个关键挑战，显著提升了GUI代理在长时程任务中的表现和流程奖励的准确性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提高了模型执行TIR任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵引导的采样和多阶段微调，有效提升了LLMs在工具集成推理中的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

Conclusion: 模式感知方法对工具集成推理非常有效，强调了正确选择工具应用模式的重要性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出JET方法训练模型主动终止不必要的推理步骤，在保持准确性的同时显著提高推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在rollout阶段构建短推理路径，限制了有效学习

Method: 基于证据积累模型的洞察，在推理早期积累足够信息后主动终止推理；在rollout阶段进行轨迹截断，使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理

Result: JET显著提高推理效率而不牺牲准确性，DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥赛基准上准确率提升4.6%同时输出长度减少46.3%

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理步骤，有效解决了大型推理模型的效率问题，实现了准确性和效率的双重提升

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA是一个用于评估LLM代理在电子健康记录数据访问中端到端工作流程的基准测试，重点关注查询模糊性和术语不匹配问题，通过两种交互流程测试代理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够捕捉真实世界临床数据访问流程的基准测试，阻碍了LLM代理在电子健康记录系统中的实际部署，主要挑战包括用户问题的查询模糊性和用户术语与数据库条目不匹配。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA基准测试，在模拟环境中使用LLM用户评估数据库代理，包含两种交互流程：增量查询精炼（IncreQA）和自适应查询精炼（AdaptQA），测试代理澄清问题、使用工具解决术语不匹配和生成正确SQL的能力。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM代理在IncreQA上Pass@5达到90-95%，AdaptQA上达到60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验一致成功）显著降低35-60%，表明代理缺乏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在安全关键的电子健康记录领域，需要构建不仅性能好而且鲁棒的代理，论文提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解以指导未来代理开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative
partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are
bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any
language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes
how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,
knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool
interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural
language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes
tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia,
ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of
a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的二进制代码相似性检测方法，通过结构化推理生成可解释的特征，在保持准确性的同时解决了现有方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二进制代码相似性检测方法存在局限性：手工特征可解释但泛化能力差，嵌入方法泛化能力强但不可解释且面临可扩展性-准确性权衡。需要一种能同时兼顾可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性的方法。

Method: 使用语言模型代理对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常数和算法意图等人类可读的特征，这些特征可以直接通过倒排或关系索引进行搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的recall@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Motivation: 传统精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要领域特定的参数校准，而基于学习的方法由于固定训练数据导致泛化能力差和可扩展性有限。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型从可视化的TSP实例中识别有希望的小规模子问题，然后使用现成的求解器对这些子问题进行高效优化，以改进全局解。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP始终实现平均最优性差距低于0.2%的解，优于现有的基于学习的方法。在相同的运行时间预算下，它比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3的差距减少了12%到100%，特别是在超过10k节点的超大规模实例上。

Conclusion: ViTSP框架为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统中的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI模型特别是基础模型存在地理偏见问题，但现有评估方法要么是模型特定的，要么是空间隐式的，缺乏通用且空间显式的评估框架。

Method: 建立信息论框架GeoBS，提出三种考虑多尺度性、距离衰减和各向异性等复杂空间因素的新地理偏见评分方法。

Result: 在3个任务、8个数据集和8个模型上的实验表明，任务特定的GeoAI模型和通用基础模型都存在各种类型的地理偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能增进对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Result: 在数学考试预测中达到80%以上准确率，在低数据环境下超越了所有传统IRT和矩阵分解基准方法。

Conclusion: 单一潜在能力参数足以实现最大预测准确率，提出的变分推断框架在数据稀疏环境下表现最优，为AI辅导系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了能力熟悉度签名来表征大语言模型基准测试及其有意义的重叠，通过提取基准签名来分析LLM能力之间的相互联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力的混淆问题，基准测试间的重叠分析受限于语义相似性和性能相关性，需要更机制化的方法来理解基准有效性和LLM能力敏感性。

Method: 通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，在32个LLMs和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，这些签名是基于自然语料库中的显著标记，其中LLM标记困惑度能高度预测基准性能。

Result: 发现知识和推理子任务存在重叠，多语言和文化基准相似性较低，性能结果受基准正交因素影响，而基准签名对这些影响保持稳健。编码是最不重叠的领域。

Conclusion: 基准签名提供了对基准有效性和LLM敏感性的机制性洞察，揭示了逻辑、数学、语言、指令遵循和世界建模之间的跨功能重叠，描绘了LLM能力的相互连接景观。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Method: 使用上下文多臂赌博机算法，结合上下文信息动态评估何时信任AI贡献，提出标准化信任校准度量和指示器。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上验证，有效信任校准使决策性能显著提升，奖励指标提高10-38%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强理论理解，还为关键领域（如疾病诊断和刑事司法）开发更可信AI系统提供实践指导。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新LLM不断发布，但参数数量与性能表现不一致，需要独立评估方法。当前最佳方法是测量Elo分数，但需要人工比较LLM输出，成本高昂。

Method: 让LLM判断模型对战结果，通过其一致性选择最佳模型的频率来生成评估指标。

Result: LLM自身判断产生的指标与人类生成的Elo分数有91%的相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单且低成本的Elo分数代理，无需人工数据或先验知识。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体编排是否能通过集体决策超越单个LLM的性能，并探索影响编排效果的关键因素如作者身份透明度和投票过程可见性。

Method: 使用四种LLM在三个基准数据集上进行实验：比较编排与单模型性能，并在GPQA-Diamond上消融研究作者身份显示和投票过程可见性的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越最强单模型，始终优于其他模型。显示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示投票过程会放大从众效应，加速收敛但可能导致过早共识。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，通过适当的信息控制可进一步优化编排效果，避免自投票和从众效应带来的负面影响。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，并实现更有效的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中医AI处方推荐方法主要关注症状-草药关系，但存在三个关键局限：忽视患者个性化信息（年龄、BMI、病史等）影响辨证准确性；草药数据的长尾分布导致训练偏差；忽略君臣佐使配伍原则增加毒副作用风险。

Method: 1) 使用患者个性化提示序列预训练症状表示，应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；2) 采用KG引导的同构图扩散方法结合自注意力机制全局捕获非线性症状-草药关系；3) 设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候，细粒度指导处方生成并缓解长尾分布问题。

Result: 在2个公共数据集和1个临床数据集上的广泛实验证明了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行全面评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更准确地识别证候、提高疗效并降低毒副作用风险。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

Motivation: 人类反馈在语言模型对齐中至关重要，但反馈数据往往存在噪声和不一致，这会降低奖励模型质量并阻碍对齐效果。现有数据清洗方法缺乏系统性评估和通用性验证。

Method: 引入PrefCleanBench基准，提供标准化评估协议，在多样化数据集、模型架构和优化算法下评估13种偏好数据清洗方法的对齐性能和通用性。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过更好的数据预处理改进语言模型对齐提供了原则性和可复现的方法，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的重要作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Motivation: 现有扩散规划器在反应式闭环环境中难以有效引导，简单条件化在复杂动态驾驶场景中指导不足，而基于锚点的方法存在理论不一致性和性能问题。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive锚点引导扩散桥策略，提供理论严谨的扩散框架，将锚点转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适应不同交通条件，兼容高效ODE求解器。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中达到最先进性能，成功率比现有方法提高5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了理论严谨且高效的解决方案，在复杂动态驾驶场景中表现出色，适合实时自动驾驶部署。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理防护存在两个根本局限：对所有用户应用统一防护策略，忽略了个体差异；仅检查单次响应，忽略了跨多轮交互的风险累积。

Method: 1) 通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态创建个性化防护；2) 在整个代理流程中部署专门防护模块（计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护、记忆守护者）进行持续监控；3) 跟踪跨轮次风险累积并发出可验证裁决。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于包括LlamaGuard3和AGrail在内的现有代理防护方案。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM代理提供了可执行和可审计的个性化安全路径，有效解决了现有防护系统的局限性。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 现有基于文本原理的行为克隆方法存在根本局限，只能让学生模型模仿表面模式而非推理的算法结构，导致逻辑鲁棒性不足。

Method: 将推理重构为结构化生成过程：先抽象教师思维过程为离散语义信号序列（如对比、添加等），然后通过多任务目标训练学生模型预测下一个语义信号并生成相应推理步骤。

Result: 在多个挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具备推理能力而非仅流畅模仿的小型模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR重新定义为结构自组织的可预测过程，为未来AI系统推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 搜索代理连接LLM与互联网，能够获取更广泛和更新的信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 引入一个系统性、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队框架，构建包含300个测试用例的SafeSearch基准，覆盖五类风险（如错误信息和间接提示注入），评估三种代表性搜索代理架构。

Result: 评估结果显示LLM搜索代理存在重大漏洞：当暴露于不可靠网站时，GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的最高攻击成功率达到了90.5%。常见防御实践（如提醒提示）效果有限。

Conclusion: 该框架在促进更安全的代理开发透明度方面具有重要价值，强调了搜索代理安全评估的必要性。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上可靠激活的能力。

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活。

Result: 敏感性衡量了特征质量的新维度，许多可解释特征敏感性较差，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，为机制可解释性研究提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Conclusion: MedLA提供了一个可推广的范式，用于可信赖的医学推理，能够有效扩展至开源和商业LLM骨干。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Result: 在两个诊断性多对象数据集上，OCEAN与最先进的黑盒模型表现相当，用户研究显示其解释更直观和可信。

Conclusion: OCEAN提供了一个忠实且可解释的决策过程，在保持竞争力的同时提供更直观可信的解释。

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ChemMAS多智能体系统，将化学反应条件推荐重构为基于证据的推理任务，通过分解机制、多通道召回、约束感知辩论和理性聚合来提供可解释的推荐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法很少解释推荐反应条件的原理，限制了在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 将条件预测分解为机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知智能体辩论和理性聚合四个步骤，每个决策都有基于化学知识和检索先例的可解释理由支持。

Result: 在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提升20-35%，比通用大语言模型提升10-15%，同时提供可证伪、人类可信的推理依据。

Conclusion: 为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: FalconEye有潜力成为MLLMs的实际安全审计工具，能够可靠识别复杂安全关键多模态对话场景中的有害内容。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle
game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming
in educational settings.

Method: 基于真实客服对话构建Mix-ECom语料库，通过后处理去除用户隐私并添加思维链过程，包含多种对话类型和电商规则，并建立基线模型和动态框架。

Result: 结果显示当前电商代理在处理电商对话时能力不足，主要由于复杂领域规则导致的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: Mix-ECom数据集填补了电商代理评估的空白，揭示了现有代理在复杂规则处理上的局限性，数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统的快速演进带来了显著风险，其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为使得传统验证方法不足，需要转向概率保证

Method: 作为检查层观察agent的原始I/O，将其抽象为状态模型转换的形式化事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程来建模agent的涌现行为

Result: 通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性

Conclusion: AgentGuard框架为自主AI系统提供了有效的运行时验证方法，能够处理其不可预测性和涌现行为

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Conclusion: 梯度耦合是智能体强化学习中的关键问题，通过分类好坏动作可以有效分离嵌入表示并减轻梯度干扰，从而提升训练效果。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本文为使用纤维化作为解释神经网络学习逻辑理论的形式化工具开辟了道路。

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在LLM推理任务中依赖手工设计的奖励或优势塑造，这些方向性先验容易产生偏差且需要精细调参。

Method: CANON方法将采样响应按目标指标高低分组，通过组间比较确定哪个指标趋势能带来更好性能，并在组内识别更好响应。

Conclusion: CANON方法有效放大了目标指标的影响而无需预设方向，在性能-成本权衡中产生了更优的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可解释性的同时实现了准确的论文筛选，扩展了可用的信息源类型。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for

Conclusion: CoTutor展示了AI在教育技术中推动个性化学习和可扩展性的潜力，同时为隐私和伦理考量提供了未来发展机会，确保AI辅助知识追踪过程而保留人类的教学判断权。

Abstract: Learning to learn is becoming a science, driven by the convergence of
knowledge tracing, signal processing, and generative AI to model student
learning states and optimize education. We propose CoTutor, an AI-driven model
that enhances Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with signal processing techniques to
improve student progress modeling and deliver adaptive feedback and strategies.
Deployed as an AI copilot, CoTutor combines generative AI with adaptive
learning technology. In university trials, it has demonstrated measurable
improvements in learning outcomes while outperforming conventional educational
tools. Our results highlight its potential for AI-driven personalization,
scalability, and future opportunities for advancing privacy and ethical
considerations in educational technology. Inspired by Richard Hamming's vision
of computer-aided 'learning to learn,' CoTutor applies convex optimization and
signal processing to automate and scale up learning analytics, while reserving
pedagogical judgment for humans, ensuring AI facilitates the process of
knowledge tracing while enabling learners to uncover new insights.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，建议使用≥2次重复运行来提升模型比较的稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不清楚

Method: 在AI4Math基准上对8个最先进模型进行3次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估

Result: 单次运行排行榜脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次成对排名反转；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转；平均运行仅带来约5%的标准误缩减

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行，这能提高稳健性且对小团队可行

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

TL;DR: Fathom-DeepResearch是一个由两个专门模型组成的智能系统：Fathom-Search-4B用于基于证据的网络搜索调查，Fathom-Synthesizer-4B用于将搜索轨迹转换为结构化研究报告。该系统在多个基准测试中达到开源权重类别的最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 工具集成推理已成为实现智能应用的关键焦点，DeepResearch智能体因其在复杂、开放式信息搜索任务中的强大表现而受到关注。

Method: 使用DUETQA数据集、RAPO强化学习方法和可引导的步骤级奖励来训练Fathom-Search-4B模型；训练Fathom-Synthesizer-4B模型将多轮搜索轨迹转换为结构化报告。

Result: 在DeepSearch基准测试（SimpleQA、FRAMES、WebWalker、Seal0、MuSiQue）和DeepResearch-Bench上达到开源权重类别的最先进性能，并在HLE、AIME-25、GPQA-Diamond和MedQA等推理任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Fathom-DeepResearch系统通过专门的搜索和合成模型，在复杂信息搜索任务中实现了卓越性能，并展示了广泛的泛化能力。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了鲁棒偏好优化（RPO）方法，通过EM算法推断标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失来缓解人类偏好数据中的噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好对齐方法（如RLHF）基于两个有缺陷的假设：人类偏好是同质的且收集的数据是无噪声的。实际上人类偏好是多元的且标注者会犯错，这导致记录数据与真实偏好之间存在差异，误导模型并降低性能。

Method: 使用期望最大化（EM）算法推断每个标签正确性的后验概率，基于此自适应重加权训练损失中的每个数据点。建立了任意偏好损失与对应概率模型之间的理论联系，将现有对齐算法系统转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架，显著提升了四种最先进对齐算法（DPO、IPO、SimPO、CPO）的性能。在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别实现了高达7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO提供了一个系统框架来解决人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，理论上证明在完美校准模型条件下能收敛到数据集的真实噪声水平，实验验证了其作为元框架的有效性。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出在线对齐比离线对齐性能更好的原因在于人类对概率的感知偏差，并提出通过显式建模人类概率感知偏差的humanline方法，即使使用离线数据也能达到在线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在线对齐方法（如GRPO）通常比离线对齐方法（如DPO）表现更好，从行为经济学的角度提供人类中心化的解释。

Method: 提出humanline设计模式，将人类对概率的感知偏差显式地融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中，即使使用离线非策略数据也能达到在线方法的性能。

Result: humanline变体即使在离线非策略数据上训练，也能在可验证和不可验证任务上匹配其在线对应方法的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身并不是最大化人类效用的关键，通过选择性训练模拟人类感知的数据可以达到相同效果，从而实现更快、更便宜、更灵活的后期训练而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

TL;DR: ELHPlan是一个新颖的多机器人协作规划框架，通过引入绑定子目标意图的动作链作为基本规划单元，在动态环境中平衡适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多机器人协作中存在基本权衡：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且随团队规模和任务复杂度扩展性差。

Method: ELHPlan采用循环过程：1)构建意图绑定的动作序列，2)主动验证冲突和可行性，3)通过针对性机制精炼问题，4)执行验证后的动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan实现了可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token数量。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应的推理深度调节，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入采用统一的推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题推理不足，需要更智能的计算分配策略。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的引导向量来决策停止或继续推理，采用GRPO作为奖励信号自适应调节推理深度，通过课程学习和奖励工程学习与问题难度相关的计算分配。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500基准测试中，FR-Ponder改善了计算-精度边界，以更低的FLOPs获得匹配的精度，优于早期退出基线方法。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder展示了通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应推理深度的有效性，能够学习到与问题难度相关的计算分配策略，在不修改主干权重的情况下优化推理效率。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛使用，但缺乏能够预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大而带来收益的定量规则。

Method: 通过实证研究识别出紧凑的幂律关系，将模型大小与专家数量联系起来，并基于此提出简单理论解释收益下降规律。

Result: 该定律在领域内和跨领域都成立，紧密拟合了不同架构和方法下的测量曲线，并解释了两个稳健规律：大部分收益在早期获得，随着专家数量增加变异性减小。

Conclusion: 该缩放定律使模型融合从启发式实践转变为可计算效率高、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供了可预测的增益实现路径。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要的长输出和高的端到端延迟，限制了实际部署。现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，会引入检测开销并限制延迟收益。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态的启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟实现2.5倍加速，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法利用隐藏状态的固有信号提供有效的提前退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中具有更广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在图推理任务中表现不佳，作者发现这是因为现有方法将推理重点放在复制图算法而非设计算法上，导致基础模型能力被低估。

Method: 提出了Simple-RTC方法，引导LLMs先设计图算法然后编码解决图推理任务，同时构建了包含239个不同图问题和3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准测试。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准测试上达到接近完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准测试上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 将推理重点转向算法设计能够显著提升LLMs的图推理能力，Simple-RTC为未来LLMs图推理研究提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLMs的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法的探索范围，虽然提升了单解准确率(pass@1)，但抑制了解多样性和多解性能(pass@k)，导致RLVR更多是蒸馏现有能力而非发现新推理策略。

Method: 引入风险敏感强化学习框架，采用风险寻求目标在平均奖励和最大奖励之间插值，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从挑战性提示中学习来驱动深度探索。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和五种不同LLMs上，RS-GRPO持续提升pass@k性能，同时保持或增强pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO是简单易实现的解决方案，只需少量代码修改即可有效克服RLVR的探索困境，促进LLMs在复杂推理任务中发现新策略。

policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统移动消息设计由于无法探索高维设计空间而存在显著局限性，需要更有效的方法来优化医疗沟通效果。

Method: 基于DIKW层次结构构建的智能代理系统，通过专门的计算代理逐步将原始实验数据转化为可操作的消息设计策略。

Result: 在两阶段实验中（第一阶段444,691次患者接触，第二阶段74,908次），最佳生成消息实现了68.76%的参与度，相比61.27%的基线提升了12.2%的相对点击率。

Conclusion: 这种智能代理架构支持并行处理、假设验证和持续学习，特别适合大规模医疗沟通优化。

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

TL;DR: AdvChain：一种通过对抗性思维链调优来增强大型推理模型安全性的对齐范式，解决思维链推理中的雪球效应问题，实现更好的安全性与实用性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前思维链推理模型存在雪球效应安全漏洞，即微小的推理偏差会在多步推理过程中逐渐放大，导致有害合规或过度拒绝。现有安全调优方法缺乏自我纠正能力。

Method: 提出AdvChain对齐范式，构建包含诱惑-纠正和犹豫-纠正样本的数据集，通过对抗性思维链调优教导模型动态自我纠正，从有害推理漂移和不必要谨慎中恢复。

Result: 实验表明AdvChain显著增强了对越狱攻击和思维链劫持的鲁棒性，同时大幅减少对良性提示的过度拒绝，在不损害推理能力的情况下实现了优越的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向，证明了动态自我纠正机制在思维链推理安全中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一的图-语言框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为在图结构知识上进行高效推理提供了可扩展且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了系统性评估框架和实用路径，增强了LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLM在医疗诊断中存在关键失败模式：早期证据解释的不稳定性导致幻觉，产生分支推理轨迹并最终导致全局不一致结论，需要约束随机性和幻觉的可审计临床推理系统。

Method: 提出MedMMV框架：1) 通过多样化短轨迹稳定推理；2) 在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图；3) 使用联合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医疗基准测试中，MedMMV将准确率提升高达12.7%，并表现出更优越的可靠性。盲法医师评估证实其显著提高推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在高风险领域（如临床决策支持）部署可信AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

Motivation: 解决金融科技领域LLMs大规模微调可能产生不专业或轻率回复的问题，以及领域特定数据集稀缺导致现有研究只能关注孤立组件的研究空白。

Method: 引入Fin-Vault多轮金融对话数据集（1,417个标注对话），开发Fin-Ally统一模型，集成COMET-BART嵌入的常识上下文，并使用直接偏好优化（DPO）机制生成人类对齐的响应。

Result: 结合常识上下文使语言模型能够生成更精细、文本精确且专业基础的金融指导，支持个性化预算、实时支出跟踪和自动化财务规划。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融科技领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，通过整合常识推理和人类对话动态，显著提升了金融咨询的专业性和用户信任度。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

TL;DR: 提出了自适应蒙特卡洛搜索（AMCS）框架，用于高效生成过程监督数据来训练过程奖励模型（PRM），显著提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中需要遍历巨大搜索空间进行路径扩展，导致效率低下且缺乏灵活性。

Method: AMCS框架将数据生成从固定静态搜索转变为自适应动态搜索，包括：1）自适应节点值估计，为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本；2）基于蒙特卡洛算法的时间自适应策略进行路径扩展，从广泛探索逐渐转向最有希望的方向。

Result: 构建了包含约20万过程监督样本的大规模数据集MathSearch-200K。在四个数学推理基准测试中，Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，优于所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下超越了72B模型。

Conclusion: AMCS方法在分布外问题上保持一致性优势，展示了强大的泛化能力，为高效训练过程奖励模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个新颖的数学推理框架，通过策略规划和目标执行两阶段方法，使用轻量级策略适配器动态选择最适合的推理策略，在多个数学推理基准测试中显著优于单一策略和集成方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定的单一策略进行数学推理，无法适应问题特定需求，忽视了效果与效率之间的权衡。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，将数学推理解耦为策略规划和目标执行两个阶段。首先创建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，然后训练轻量级策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布。推理时使用自适应路由策略动态定制推理方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM始终优于单一策略和集成基线，在不同基础模型上实现了0.9%到7.6%的改进。自适应路由方法在各种模型架构的数学推理任务中表现出特别强的优势。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过动态策略选择和自适应路由，有效解决了数学推理中单一策略无法适应不同问题需求的问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升了推理效果。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 论文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程来提升大推理模型的安全性，在保持推理能力的同时显著降低有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这些不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，因此需要专门对推理过程本身进行安全对齐。

Method: 提出IPO方法，通过将合规步骤替换为安全触发器，构建强信号偏好学习对，利用过程监督来确保推理过程的安全性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a

Conclusion: 通过建模领域无关的逻辑流程而非依赖领域特定知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，显著提升了过程奖励模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

### [609] [Overcoming Over-Fitting in Constraint Acquisition via Query-Driven Interactive Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24489)
*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合约束获取框架，结合被动学习和主动查询来防止过拟合，通过概率置信度识别虚假约束，在有限数据下实现高模型覆盖率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统被动约束获取方法容易在有限数据上过拟合，学习到虚假的全局约束；而纯主动方法查询成本过高。需要一种平衡的方法来解决过拟合问题。

Method: 集成被动学习生成候选约束，查询驱动的交互式精炼阶段使用概率置信度识别过拟合约束，专门的子集探索机制从被拒绝候选约束中恢复有效子结构，最后主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健且实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Motivation: 传统方法主要关注推理时动态性或计算效率，而该方法受生物系统中神经可塑性的启发，旨在实现训练期间网络结构的动态适应性。

Method: 每个新任务触发动态网络适应，包括基于相似性的任务识别和候选ANN头的选择性训练，然后根据性能评估并集成到模型中。

Result: 在三个Kaggle多任务需求预测数据集上的评估显示，相比传统基线和最先进的多任务学习方法，NMT-Net实现了更低的RMSE和标准差。

Conclusion: NMT-Net为时间序列预测中的多任务和持续学习提供了可扩展、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub
repository.

Motivation: 传统组合优化问题需要大量领域知识和手工设计的启发式算法，现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法容易陷入局部最优。

Method: EvoPH框架将提示与启发式算法协同进化，使用岛屿迁移模型模拟多样化群体，并结合精英选择算法，通过性能反馈指导进化过程。

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上的实验表明，EvoPH相比最优解的相对误差最低。

Conclusion: EvoPH框架推动了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域的发展，能够有效避免局部最优并生成高性能启发式算法。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Motivation: 先前世界模型无法准确预测复杂环境中的物体交互，而Dreamer 4旨在通过准确的世界模型和想象力训练，为智能代理提供可扩展的解决方案，特别是在需要从离线数据学习的实际应用场景中。

Method: 采用快捷强制目标和高效Transformer架构实现实时交互推理，从少量数据中学习通用动作条件，主要从多样化无标签视频中提取知识，通过想象力训练学习行为。

Conclusion: Dreamer 4为想象力训练提供了可扩展的配方，标志着向智能代理迈出的重要一步，展示了在复杂环境中仅从离线数据学习的能力。

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

Method: 构建人机教学架构，人类通过提供演示示例来教导AI代理；利用领域知识拓宽代理的任务理解，使用学习算法从有限示例中高效学习，优化人类选择最具代表性且冗余度低的示例

Result: 在食材替换任务中，代理仅需100个示例就能达到完整训练集（50k示例）一半的任务性能，通过策略性示例排序和利用外部符号知识的学习方法，代理能够更高效地泛化

Conclusion: 通过结合策略性示例选择和利用外部知识的学习方法，AI代理能够从少量示例中高效学习主观任务，实现更直观的人机交互

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现即使通信能实现协调，也不一定意味着真正的理解。在信号游戏中，代理可能发展出"成功的误解"——使用不同的信号解释但依然能协调。这种误解难以发现和修复，且在与新伙伴互动时会失败。确保共享解释出现需要至少3个代理且彼此互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设：协调是否意味着理解。探索在代理感知环境差异很大（如人机混合群体）的情况下，通信如何自然涌现。

Method: 使用信号游戏，代理在没有共同观察的情况下发展新信号词汇，仅通过通信信号和互动结果（奖励）来协调。代理发展信号、使用信号并精炼解释，但不观察其他代理如何使用信号。

Result: 群体总能达到最优协调水平，但有时代理对信号的解释和使用不同，形成"成功的误解"。这种误解在与新互动伙伴协调时会失败。至少3个代理且彼此互动是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。

Conclusion: 仅凭协调成功不能证明真正的理解。"成功的误解"是通信系统的一个隐藏风险。群体规模（≥3）和完全互动是确保共享解释自然涌现的关键条件。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在遇到超出能力范围的问题时，会持续进行无效推理直到上下文限制，既浪费计算资源又产生错误答案，这暴露了现有回答范式忽视模型能力边界的问题。

Method: 通过分析模型的推理置信度轨迹和隐藏状态，发现可解问题和不可解问题在置信度增长模式和隐藏状态空间上存在明显差异，据此提出了推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种边界感知策略。

Result: 实验表明，边界感知策略能够在不牺牲准确率的情况下，显著减少无效推理，将token使用量降低62.7%到93.6%，大幅提升了模型的可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具备感知自身能力边界的能力，通过监控推理表达和隐藏状态可以有效识别不可解问题，避免无效计算，为构建更可靠高效的大模型系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more

Method: LogicAgent框架：基于符号学方阵的多视角一阶逻辑推理，通过存在性导入检查和三值决策方案（真、假、不确定）来避免空洞推理。

Result: 在RepublicQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均提升6.25%；在主流逻辑推理基准测试中平均提升7.05%。

Conclusion: 符号学基础的多视角推理能有效提升大语言模型的逻辑性能，特别是在处理复杂语义和逻辑关系方面。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Motivation: 现有方法只能揭示全局能力电路，无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要更本地化的输入级解释。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发归一化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，以及基于采样的高效稀疏电路识别方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，发现模型内部存在极其稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%的连接就能恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为实现语言模型处理单个输入的忠实、可扩展解释迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换而忽视训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标量化样本的逻辑推理复杂度，并提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于数据为中心的策略，在强化学习框架下也得到验证，提升了模型的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度而非数据规模或表面形式，对于实现大语言模型的全部认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions是一个用于物理奥林匹克竞赛的协同进化多智能体系统，通过视觉、逻辑和评审三个工作室的协同工作，实现了在物理奥林匹克竞赛中的突破性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，需要复杂的推理和多模态理解，但现有AI方法多为单一模型，开源MLLM很少能达到金牌水平。

Method: 系统包含三个协同工作室：视觉工作室解释图表，逻辑工作室制定解决方案，评审工作室进行双阶段验证。通过迭代优化循环，评审工作室的反馈持续指导逻辑工作室，使系统能够自我纠正并收敛到真实答案。

Result: 在HiPhO基准测试中，PhysicsMinions实现了三大突破：强泛化能力、历史性突破（将开源模型金牌数从1-2个提升到6个），以及达到人类专家水平（在最新IPhO中排名第4，远超单一模型）。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级别的问题解决提供了一个可推广的框架，有潜力扩展到其他学科。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Motivation: 大语言模型的社会科学研究领域碎片化，需要系统性的分类框架来整合现有研究，明确证据标准，促进该领域的累积性进展。

Method: 采用文本嵌入、无监督聚类和主题建模的计算方法，对270项研究进行系统综述，构建计算分类法。

Result: 识别出三个有机出现的核心领域：LLM作为社会心智（研究模型行为引发的心智归因）、LLM社会（多智能体环境中的协调与制度）、LLM-人类交互（AI对人类活动的影响）。

Conclusion: 该分类法为碎片化领域提供了可复现的地图，澄清了不同分析层次的证据标准，并突出了人工智能社会科学中累积性进展的机会。

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: RealUnify是一个专门评估多模态模型中理解与生成能力双向协同作用的基准测试，包含1000个人工标注实例，通过双评估协议分析模型是否能有效整合这两种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要孤立评估理解和生成能力，无法确定统一模型是否能利用理解来增强生成，或通过生成模拟来促进更深层次的理解。

Method: 构建包含10个类别和32个子任务的RealUnify基准，围绕两个核心轴：理解增强生成（需要推理指导图像生成）和生成增强理解（需要心理模拟解决推理任务），采用端到端评估和诊断性分步评估的双重协议。

Result: 对12个领先的统一模型和6个专业基线的大规模评估显示，当前统一模型在实现有效协同方面仍然困难，表明仅靠架构统一是不够的。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

TL;DR: SQuID方法利用大语言模型嵌入有效恢复心理测量问卷的潜在维度结构，无需领域特定微调即可获得维度间负相关关系


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索语义嵌入技术复制心理测量结构的可行性

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理大语言模型嵌入，在修订版肖像价值问卷(PVQ-RR)上验证，比较多种嵌入模型和评估指标

Result: 嵌入方法能解释人类数据中55%的维度相似性方差，多维标度配置显示良好的因子一致性，与理论基础相符

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制传统心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量学和社会科学研究提供补充方法

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Motivation: 现有规范性理论和任务驱动理论难以在竞争理论之间进行定量仲裁，也难以作为归纳偏置来改进真实生物数据集的数据驱动拟合。

Method: 使用自适应深度核高斯过程，在规范性理论生成的合成数据上进行元学习，获得理论知情核，该核定义了表示理论预测的概率模型。

Result: 在早期视觉系统应用中，相比传统数据驱动基线，提高了对小鼠视网膜神经节细胞自然场景刺激响应预测的准确性，同时提供良好校准的不确定性估计和可解释表示。

Conclusion: 该工作为神经科学及其他领域提供了一个更通用、可扩展和自动化的方法，将理论知识整合到数据驱动的科学探究中。

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench填补了法律领域多智能体系统评估方法的空白，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Motivation: V2X协同感知系统虽然能解决单智能体感知系统的局限，但由于其复杂的组成（多样传感器类型、协作智能体、不同融合方案和通信条件），存在许多操作挑战，且错误类型和原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模系统评估，识别和分析协同感知系统中的6种常见错误模式，系统评估关键组件性能，包括不同传感器配置、通信方式和融合方案。

Result: (1) LiDAR协同配置感知性能最高；(2) V2I和V2V在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3) 协同感知错误增加可能导致更多驾驶违规；(4) 在线运行时系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，希望研究结果能促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有在线强化学习方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，忽略了问题难度与模型当前能力的巨大差异，导致对已掌握问题的低效探索和对挑战性问题缺乏有效指导，限制了学习效率和性能上限。

Method: CLPO算法在策略优化过程中创建动态教学反馈循环，利用模型自身表现进行实时难度评估构建在线课程，通过自适应问题重构机制让模型作为自己的老师：多样化中等难度问题以促进泛化，简化挑战性问题使其更易掌握。

Result: 在八个具有挑战性的数学和通用推理基准测试中，CLPO实现了最先进的性能，平均pass@1指标比其他方法提高了6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同演化的动态过程，证明了其能够更高效地训练更具能力的推理模型。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息提示，成本高且扩展性差，任务覆盖范围有限。需要高质量、多样化的下游代理任务数据集来扩展多模态大语言模型的后期训练。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段流程：探索阶段使用MLLM探索代理系统发现新环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指导提示作为上下文，合成多样、可执行且可验证的任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用中生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用中生成10k任务。训练出的UI代理在移动使用场景中成功率提升20.0%，在计算机使用场景中提升10.9%。结合强化学习训练可额外获得5.7%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为后期训练能力强的MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，显著减少了对人类标注的依赖，为构建交互式代理提供了有效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate
adaptation strategies.

TL;DR: 研究表明强化学习(RL)能让大语言模型(LLMs)获得真正的新技能，通过组合现有技能来学习未见过的函数组合，这种能力还能泛化到更复杂的问题和不同任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于RL在LLM后训练中作用的争议：RL是教授真正新技能还是仅仅激活现有能力。通过受控实验探究LLM是否能通过RL获得组合技能。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数的能力。在LLM已学习函数f和g的基础上，使用RL训练其学习未见组合h(x)=g(f(x))，并与next-token训练对比。

Result: RL使LLM能够学习未见函数组合，这种组合能力能泛化到>2个函数的更复杂组合，并能迁移到不同任务中。RL从根本上改变了模型的推理行为。

Conclusion: RL能让LLM获得真正的新技能，建议先构建具备基础技能的基座模型，然后使用RL激励高级、可泛化的技能来解决复杂问题。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了从人类交互中进行强化学习(RLHI)的新范式，通过用户引导重写和基于用户奖励的方法，利用真实对话数据实现个性化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预先标注的专家反馈进行对齐，但为了持续改进和多方面对齐，需要从自然的人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发了两种互补方法：(1) RLHI与用户引导重写，基于用户的自然语言后续响应修订不满意的模型输出；(2) RLHI与基于用户奖励，通过基于用户长期交互历史(称为人设)的奖励模型学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 自然的人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过多视角文本描述增强视觉语言导航代理的方法，利用基于文本的类比推理来改善全局场景理解和空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的零样本视觉语言导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕捉高级推理所需的抽象语义）。

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述，促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理来增强代理的全局场景理解和空间推理。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明，导航性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理，可以有效提升视觉语言导航代理的上下文理解能力和导航性能。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了ReasoningBank记忆框架，从智能体的成功和失败经验中提炼可泛化的推理策略，并通过内存感知的测试时扩展(MaTTS)加速学习过程，使智能体能够随时间自我进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型智能体在处理连续任务流时，无法从积累的交互历史中学习，导致重复过去的错误并丢弃宝贵见解。

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体自我判断的成功和失败经验中提取推理策略，测试时检索相关记忆指导交互，并整合新学习成果；MaTTS通过扩展智能体的交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank始终优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，提高了有效性和效率；MaTTS进一步放大了这些收益。

Conclusion: 内存驱动的经验扩展成为了新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在需要串行视觉处理的任务中表现不佳，与人类存在显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务中却不如人类

Method: 通过几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转三个领域的任务，比较人类和VLM在串行处理需求不同的任务中的表现

Result: VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加（作为串行处理负载的代理）呈强相关，串行处理需求越高，VLM与人类表现差距越大

Conclusion: 当前VLM在串行、基于视觉的推理能力上存在根本性瓶颈，这是与人类的主要区别

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

TL;DR: 提出UniAPL统一对抗偏好学习框架，将后训练对齐视为统一的偏好学习问题，通过单阶段训练同时利用演示偏好和比较偏好数据，解决传统SFT+RL流程中的分布不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT后接RL的流程存在关键分布不匹配问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，但策略演化时生成分布会漂移，使得SFT知识变得脆弱。后续RL无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富真实知识，导致效率低下、无基础的更新。

Method: 将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习。在每个梯度步骤中，密集的专家演示直接基础和正则化在线探索。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上评估，使用Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507作为教师模型。UniAPL匹配或超过强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（匹配32B模型），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超过教师模型。

Conclusion: UniAPL输出紧密模仿专家演示，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题并最大化数据协同效应。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

TL;DR: 提出并形式化了判断检测任务，系统研究了LLM生成判断的可检测性，并开发了J-Detector检测器来识别LLM生成的判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有偏见和脆弱性，在学术同行评审等敏感场景中需要区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法无法有效处理判断检测问题。

Method: 提出了J-Detector，一种轻量级透明神经网络检测器，通过显式提取语言和LLM增强特征，将LLM法官的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行准确检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM法官的偏见，并验证了判断检测在实际场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: LLM生成的判断是可检测的，J-Detector提供了一种有效的方法来识别这些判断，并有助于理解影响判断检测性的关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
