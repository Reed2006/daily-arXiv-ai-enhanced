TL;DR: RxBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在处方审核任务中的综合基准，包含多种题型和处方错误类型，测试了18个前沿LLM，发现领先模型在某些任务上可匹敌或超越药师表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在临床决策支持中的快速应用，特别是在处方审核领域，需要建立一个系统化、细粒度的评估框架来准确衡量模型性能，揭示其能力和局限性。

Method: 开发了RxBench基准，涵盖常见处方审核类别，整合了14种常见处方错误类型，包含1150道单选题、230道多选题和879道简答题，所有题目均由经验丰富的临床药师审核。测试了18个前沿LLM，并与持证药师进行对比。

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06、Grok-4-0709和DeepSeek-R1-0528表现最佳，形成第一梯队。领先LLM在特定任务上可匹敌或超越药师表现。通过对中等模型进行针对性微调，获得了在简答题任务上可与领先通用LLM媲美的专用模型。

Conclusion: RxBench建立了一个标准化、错误类型导向的评估框架，不仅揭示了前沿LLM在处方审核中的能力和局限性，还为构建更可靠、专门的临床工具提供了基础资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种模型选择方法学(MSM)，通过分析大语言模型在医疗领域的排行榜和基准测试，为特定用例选择最合适的模型提供系统指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型快速发展，新基础模型不断涌现，为特定应用场景选择最合适的模型变得越来越复杂。现有模型选择需要考虑定性（模型卡片信息）和定量（性能表现）两个维度，但缺乏系统的方法来指导这一选择过程。

Conclusion: 论文强调了大语言模型选择中定量维度的重要性，提出的模型选择方法学(MSM)为开发者和研究人员提供了实用的系统化指导，帮助他们在快速发展的模型生态系统中做出明智的选择决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

TL;DR: 提出CCD框架，通过轨迹修正机制和历史上下文增强序列连贯性，结合自适应采样策略，在DLMs中同时提升推理速度和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型推理方法依赖局部即时指标（如置信度、熵），缺乏可靠视角，导致采样轨迹不一致和生成质量欠佳

Method: 提出连贯上下文解码（CCD）框架：1）轨迹修正机制利用历史上下文增强序列连贯性，早期拒绝次优路径；2）自适应采样策略根据一致性指标动态调整每个步骤的解码预算

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA基准测试中，实现推理速度最高3.48倍加速，性能提升3.91%，同时提升推理速度和生成质量

Conclusion: CCD框架通过理论指导的轨迹修正和自适应采样，解决了DLMs推理中的一致性和效率问题，实现了速度和质量的双重提升

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于对称和辛微分方程的可逆LLM架构，通过时间可逆动力学在反向传播时检索隐藏状态，无需存储激活值，大幅降低内存消耗，并可将现有非可逆LLM转换为可逆架构。


<details>

Motivation: LLM训练成本高昂且耗时，通常需要微调预训练模型。现有架构需要存储所有中间激活值，导致内存消耗大，限制了批处理大小和训练效率。

Method: 1. 受对称和辛微分方程启发，设计内存高效的可逆LLM架构；2. 利用时间可逆动力学在反向传播时检索隐藏状态，无需存储激活值；3. 提出将现有非可逆LLM转换为可逆架构的微调方法。

Conclusion: 提出的可逆架构为降低LLM从头训练和微调的内存和计算成本提供了可扩展且高效的路径，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文探索将内存高效微调(MEFT)方法应用于预训练语音模型，在保持准确率的同时显著减少GPU内存使用并加速训练速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言识别(DI)任务对下游语音任务很重要，但微调语音模型计算成本和内存需求高。现有的参数高效微调(PEFT)方法参数效率高，但在内存效率和训练速度方面改进有限

Method: 探索将最初为语言处理提出的内存高效微调(MEFT)方法应用于通用预训练语音模型，并全面分析各种MEFT方法的GPU内存使用和微调速度

Result: 在KeSpeech数据集上微调Whisper模型识别六种普通话子方言，GPU内存使用减少高达73.25%，训练速度加速2.1倍，同时保持与普通微调和PEFT方法相当的准确率

Conclusion: MEFT方法能有效解决语音模型微调中的内存和速度问题，为方言识别等任务提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

TL;DR: RESP是一个自反思结构化剪枝框架，专门针对推理大语言模型，通过自生成校准、解码梯度重要性估计和渐进式再生，在保持推理能力的同时实现高效剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理大语言模型（如OpenAI o1、DeepSeek-R1、Qwen3）虽然推理能力强，但模型规模大、推理输出长，导致部署成本高且不适合资源受限环境。现有剪枝方法在推理模型上效果差，即使中等稀疏度也会严重损害推理准确性和连贯性。

Method: RESP框架包含三个关键组件：1）自生成校准：使用模型自身生成的推理轨迹作为校准数据，更准确反映推理分布；2）解码梯度重要性估计：基于解码过程计算梯度来评估参数重要性；3）渐进式再生：随着稀疏度增加保持校准保真度。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上的实验表明，RESP显著优于现有结构化剪枝方法。在20-30%稀疏度下保持接近密集模型的准确率，在更高稀疏度下大幅缓解性能崩溃。在40%稀疏度下，GSM8K达到81.3%准确率，MathQA达到59.6%，分别比最强基线提升66.87%和47%。

Conclusion: RESP通过将剪枝决策与模型的推理动态对齐，解决了推理大语言模型剪枝的挑战，为高效部署推理模型提供了有效解决方案，在保持推理能力的同时显著降低计算和内存成本。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

TL;DR: LiteReason是一种轻量级潜在推理方法，通过连续潜在token帮助模型"跳过"推理步骤，在保持性能的同时大幅减少推理长度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过生成长推理链处理复杂任务，但使用强化学习优化这些推理链计算成本很高，特别是对于涉及大量token处理的叙事相关任务

Method: 提出LiteReason方法，包含轻量级推理投影器模块，生成连续潜在token帮助跳过推理步骤；在强化学习中，策略模型决定何时激活投影器，在潜在推理和离散推理之间切换

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成任务上，方法优于潜在推理基线，接近非潜在强化学习训练的性能，同时减少最终推理长度77-92%

Conclusion: LiteReason引导强化学习训练达到性能-计算权衡曲线中更高效的部分，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示词设计对大语言模型推理性能至关重要，但提示词的具体程度（详细或模糊）对性能的影响尚未得到充分研究。需要系统评估不同具体程度的提示词如何影响模型表现。

Method: 提出DETAIL框架：1) 使用GPT-4生成多级具体程度的提示词；2) 通过困惑度量化提示词的具体程度；3) 使用基于GPT的语义等价性评估回答正确性。在30个新颖推理任务上对GPT-4和O3-mini进行实验。

Conclusion: 提示词具体程度显著影响LLM推理性能，需要根据模型大小和任务类型采用自适应提示策略。研究提供了工具和数据支持进一步探索提示词设计。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

*Boya Zhang,Alban Bornet,Rui Yang,Nan Liu,Douglas Teodoro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了HealthContradict数据集，用于评估语言模型在长且矛盾的生物医学上下文中的推理能力，发现微调后的生物医学模型既能利用正确上下文又能抵抗错误上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何利用上下文信息回答健康问题，以及当上下文存在矛盾时模型的表现如何。现有医学问答评估基准难以充分区分语言模型的上下文推理能力。

Method: 创建HealthContradict数据集（920个专家验证实例，每个包含健康问题、科学证据支持的答案和两个矛盾立场的文档），设计多种提示设置（正确、错误或矛盾上下文），评估不同语言模型的表现。

Result: HealthContradict相比现有医学问答基准能更好地区分语言模型的上下文推理能力。实验显示微调后的生物医学语言模型不仅具备预训练获得的参数知识，还能有效利用正确上下文并抵抗错误上下文的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了评估语言模型在矛盾上下文中的推理能力的重要性，展示了微调生物医学模型在复杂医学信息环境中的优势，为未来医学AI系统的开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

### [15] [When Does Verification Pay Off? A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02304)
*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了37个LLM在9个基准测试上的验证能力，发现跨模型家族验证效果最佳，后训练会降低自我改进但增强跨家族改进，数学和逻辑任务具有最高可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM作为问题求解器和解决方案验证器的交互作用了解有限，主要关注自我验证，很少研究验证器如何评估同一模型家族内或不同模型家族间的输出。现代LLM经过大量后训练，但其对验证能力的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 研究涵盖37个模型，跨越多个模型家族、不同规模以及基础模型与后训练变体。在9个基准测试上进行评估，覆盖逻辑推理、结构化谜题、符号计算、数学、常识、事实回忆和领域知识。比较自我验证、同家族验证和跨家族验证。引入并经验验证了"验证器增益"指标来预测基于拒绝采样的性能改进。

Result: 研究发现：1) 跨家族验证特别有效；2) 后训练会降低自我改进但增强跨家族改进；3) 数学和逻辑任务表现出最高的固有可验证性；4) 分析了验证器增益和误报率如何随模型规模和后训练而变化；5) 表征了数据集可验证性的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM验证能力提供了系统分析，揭示了跨模型家族验证的优势和后训练对验证能力的复杂影响，为未来LLM验证策略的设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

*Lei Fu,Xiang Chen,Kaige Gao Xinyue Huang,Kejian Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KARMA框架通过双编码器融合异构知识源、门控记忆单元动态调节知识集成、安全感知可控解码器，在服务领域的QA系统中提升答案质量和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务领域的特定领域问答系统面临整合异构知识源、确保准确性和安全性的挑战，现有大语言模型在医疗政策、政府福利等敏感领域存在事实一致性和上下文对齐问题。

Method: 提出KARMA框架：1) 双编码器架构融合结构化和非结构化知识源；2) 门控记忆单元动态调节外部知识集成；3) 安全感知可控解码器，通过安全分类和引导生成技术减少不安全输出。

Result: 在专有QA数据集上的广泛实验表明，KARMA在答案质量和安全性方面均优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为服务场景中构建可信赖和自适应的问答系统提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaleFrame是一个结合LLM和HCI的故事生成系统，通过将故事结构分解为实体、事件、关系和故事大纲四个基本单元，实现精细控制，并支持用户通过拖拽等交互方式创作故事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前故事生成系统缺乏细粒度控制和清晰的输入规范，难以准确将用户意图转化为满意的故事输出，限制了其应用性。

Method: 1. 将故事结构分解为四个基本单元：实体、事件、关系、故事大纲；2. 利用Tinystories数据集构建9,851个JSON格式的偏好数据集；3. 微调本地Llama模型实现JSON2Story转换；4. 提供直观界面支持用户创建编辑实体和事件；5. 通过拖拽、附加、连接等简单交互控制故事细节和进展。

Result: 1. 构建了包含9,851个条目的JSON格式数据集；2. 开发了支持交互式故事创作的系统；3. 故事可在七个维度（如创意性、结构完整性）进行评估；4. 系统能基于评估提供改进建议；5. 定量评估和用户研究证明了系统的实用性。

Conclusion: TaleFrame通过结构化信息生成故事，实现了对创作过程的精确控制，解决了现有系统在意图转化和细粒度控制方面的不足，为创意故事生成提供了有效的交互式解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

### [19] [What Signals Really Matter for Misinformation Tasks? Evaluating Fake-News Detection and Virality Prediction under Real-World Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02552)
*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在线虚假信息检测的两个实际任务：虚假新闻检测和传播预测，比较了文本嵌入与轻量级数值特征的效果，发现文本内容对虚假新闻检测效果显著，而传播预测更具挑战性且对标签构建敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估在需要快速响应的操作环境中，虚假新闻检测和传播预测这两个实际任务的可行性。研究者关注在计算资源受限或语言模型不可用的情况下，轻量级数值特征是否能够替代文本内容进行分析。

Method: 使用EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集，比较了文本嵌入（RoBERTa，对照组使用Mistral）与轻量级数值特征（时间、粉丝数、验证状态、点赞数）以及序列模型（GRU、门控架构、Transformer编码器）。采用基于中位数的"病毒式"分割（<50点赞）作为标签，并进行了降维分析（t-SNE vs PCA）。

Result: 文本内容对虚假新闻检测是强判别器，而纯数值管道在语言模型不可用或计算受限时仍然可行。传播预测比虚假新闻检测困难得多，且对标签构建高度敏感。降维分析表明非线性结构对传播预测比虚假新闻检测更有信息量。RoBERTa和Mistral嵌入的替换仅产生微小差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了评估设计的重要性，并报告了影响该领域可重复性的实际约束。作者在可能的情况下发布了数据分割和代码，并提供了指标选择指导。研究指出传播预测的挑战性，以及在实际操作环境中需要平衡计算资源与性能的需求。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADORE是一个自持续电商搜索相关性建模框架，通过LLM生成意图对齐的训练数据、自动合成对抗样本、以及注入领域属性知识的知识蒸馏，解决传统方法语义鸿沟和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索相关性建模面临两个主要挑战：基于术语匹配的方法（如BM25）存在语义鸿沟，而神经模型则受限于领域特定硬样本的稀缺性。需要一种能够自动生成高质量训练数据并增强模型鲁棒性的解决方案。

Method: ADORE框架包含三个创新模块：1）规则感知相关性判别模块：使用思维链LLM生成意图对齐的训练数据，并通过Kahneman-Tversky优化对齐用户行为；2）错误类型感知数据合成模块：自动生成对抗样本来增强模型鲁棒性；3）关键属性增强知识蒸馏模块：将领域特定属性层次注入可部署的学生模型中。

Result: 大规模实验和在线A/B测试验证了ADORE的有效性。该框架在资源效率和认知对齐方面为工业应用建立了新的相关性建模范式。

Conclusion: ADORE通过自动化标注、对抗生成和知识蒸馏，克服了数据稀缺问题并增强了推理能力，为工业级电商搜索相关性建模提供了资源高效且认知对齐的新范式。

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在训练语言模型时，早期阶段就混合正负优势信号，可能导致指导模糊和收益有限。需要一种更有效的信号利用策略来提升训练效果。

Method: CAPO采用自适应课程机制：1）先用正优势样本进行模仿学习建立稳健基础；2）再引入负信号培养判别能力；3）兼容多种优化方法（GRPO、PPO、RLOO、Reinforce++）。

Result: 在数学推理任务上实现稳定显著提升，并能有效泛化到多模态GUI推理场景，证明其作为通用优化框架的稳健性和有效性。

Conclusion: CAPO通过课程式优势信号利用策略，解决了现有方法信号混合不当的问题，为强化学习训练语言模型提供了更有效和稳健的优化框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

*Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在生成多文档摘要时存在首因效应，更偏向于第一个看到的文档，这给依赖LLM生成概述的应用和AI代理系统带来风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM被广泛用于多文档摘要（如Google AI Overviews），但尚不清楚它们是否平等对待所有输入文档。研究旨在探究LLM在生成概述时是否存在位置偏见。

Method: 构建40个支持-中立-反对立场的堕胎新闻文章三元组，每个三元组进行6种输入顺序排列，使用Gemini 2.5 Flash生成中立概述。通过ROUGE-L（词汇重叠）、BERTScore（语义相似度）和SummaC（事实一致性）评估摘要与源文章的关系。使用单因素方差分析和配对比较检验位置效应。

Result: BERTScore在所有立场上都显示出显著的首因效应，摘要与第一个看到的文章语义更一致。配对比较显示位置1与位置2、3有显著差异，而位置2和3之间无差异，确认了LLM对第一个文档的选择性偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在多文档摘要中存在首因效应，这给依赖LLM生成概述的应用和AI代理系统带来风险，因为涉及LLM的步骤可能不成比例地影响下游行动。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对7种模型融合算法在减轻LLM社会偏见方面的实证研究，发现偏见减少与下游性能之间存在权衡，SLERP在中等插值权重下表现最平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会继承甚至放大预训练语料中的社会偏见，威胁公平性和社会信任。虽然已有研究探索通过编辑模型参数来减轻偏见，但缺乏对不同模型融合算法的实证比较。

Method: 实证调查了7种算法：Linear、Karcher Mean、SLERP、NuSLERP、TIES、DELLA和Nearswap，应用于GPT、LLaMA和Qwen家族的13个开源权重模型。使用三个偏见数据集（BBQ、BOLD、HONEST）进行综合评估，并在SuperGLUE基准测试中测量这些技术对下游任务性能的影响。

Result: 发现偏见减少与下游性能之间存在权衡：实现更大偏见缓解的方法会降低准确性，特别是在需要阅读理解、常识和因果推理的任务上。在融合算法中，Linear、SLERP和Nearswap在保持整体性能的同时持续减少偏见，其中中等插值权重的SLERP成为最平衡的选择。

Conclusion: 模型融合算法在偏见缓解方面具有潜力，但过度的去偏见化或不适当的融合方法可能导致重要语言能力的退化。SLERP在中等权重下提供了偏见减少与性能保持的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

### [26] [CREST: Universal Safety Guardrails Through Cluster-Guided Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02711)
*Lavish Bansal,Naman Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST是一个参数高效的多语言安全分类模型，仅用0.5B参数支持100种语言，通过在13种高资源语言上训练，实现跨语言迁移到低资源语言，在安全基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全护栏主要针对高资源语言，导致使用低资源语言的大量人口在内容安全方面代表性不足，需要开发能服务全球人口的通用安全系统。

Method: 提出CREST模型，采用参数高效设计，仅使用13种高资源语言训练数据，通过基于聚类的跨语言迁移技术，将安全分类能力扩展到100种语言（包括未见的高资源和低资源语言）。

Result: 在六个安全基准测试中，CREST超越了同规模的最先进护栏，并与参数数量显著更大的模型（2.5B参数及以上）取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 语言特定的安全护栏存在局限性，需要开发能够有效扩展以服务全球人口的通用、语言无关的安全系统，CREST为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过心理物理学范式评估LLMs是否表现出类似人类的最优贝叶斯多模态整合能力，发现能力与策略存在分离，准确率高的模型不一定能有效处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在显式推理方面表现出色，但其隐式计算策略尚未充分探索。人类在感知任务中能够使用接近最优的贝叶斯策略直觉地处理和整合噪声信号，本研究旨在探究LLMs是否表现出类似行为，在没有显式训练或指令的情况下进行最优多模态整合。

Method: 采用心理物理学范式，通过系统行为研究推断LLMs的计算原理。引入行为基准BayesBench：四个基于文本和图像的幅度估计任务（长度、位置、距离、持续时间），评估九个不同的LLMs并与人类判断进行校准。通过控制噪声、上下文和指令提示的消融实验，测量多模态线索组合的性能、行为和效率。

Result: 研究显示，虽然能力强的模型通常以贝叶斯一致的方式适应，但准确率不能保证鲁棒性。特别是GPT-5 Mini在文本准确率上达到完美，但未能有效整合视觉线索。这揭示了能力与策略之间的关键分离，表明以准确率为中心的基准可能过度关注性能而忽略了脆弱的确定性处理。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLMs在处理不确定性方面出现的原理性行为，并强调了准确率与贝叶斯倾向之间的相关性。研究发布了心理物理学基准和一致性度量作为评估工具，为未来多模态架构设计提供信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自动调研系统通过检索、组织和内容合成形成端到端生成流程，如何评估这种复杂系统成为一个重要挑战。现有研究主要关注开发新的生成流程，但缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出了SurveyEval基准，从三个维度评估自动生成的调研报告：整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考文献准确性。扩展了7个学科领域的评估，并增强了LLM-as-a-Judge框架，加入人类参考来提升评估与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 评估结果显示，通用长文本或论文写作系统倾向于生成质量较低的调研报告，而专门的调研生成系统能够提供显著更高质量的结果。

Conclusion: SurveyEval作为一个可扩展的测试平台，有助于理解和改进跨不同学科和评估标准的自动调研系统。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

TL;DR: UniFact提出统一评估框架，首次实现事实核查与幻觉检测的直接比较，发现两者互补，混合方法性能最佳


<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型常产生看似流畅但事实错误的幻觉内容，损害可信度。现有研究分为模型中心的幻觉检测和文本中心的事实核查两个孤立范式，阻碍了共同进展

Method: 提出UniFact统一评估框架，通过动态生成模型输出和相应事实性标签，实现事实核查与幻觉检测在实例级别的直接比较

Result: 大规模实验发现：1) 无单一范式全面优越；2) 两种方法捕捉事实错误的不同方面，具有互补性；3) 结合两者的混合方法始终达到最佳性能

Conclusion: 需要统一幻觉检测与事实核查的研究议程，UniFact为此提供了实证基础和开源工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有对话式广义指代表达理解系统在训练与评估领域间存在分布偏移问题，且标注对话数据稀缺，限制了模型在复杂视觉场景中理解表达和无限目标的能力

Method: 采用三层次数据合成方法，平衡真实性与可控性，为对话条件化接地生成可扩展的监督数据，通过微调提升模型性能

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法有效解决了对话式广义指代表达理解中的数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，为模型提供了可扩展的监督信号，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: TriLex框架通过三阶段检索增强方法扩展低资源非洲语言情感词典，提升AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa等预训练模型在情感分析任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中代表性不足，限制了多语言NLP系统的词汇覆盖和性能表现。

Method: 提出TriLex三阶段框架：1) 基于语料库的提取；2) 跨语言映射；3) 检索增强生成驱动的词汇精炼。使用扩展后的词典评估AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa两种非洲预训练语言模型。

Result: AfroXLMR表现最佳，在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1分数超过80%，跨语言稳定性强。AfriBERTa虽未在目标语言上预训练，仍能达到约64%的F1分数。两种模型均优于传统机器学习基线，集成分析进一步提升了精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TriLex是低资源南非语言中可扩展且有效的多语言情感词典扩展和情感建模框架。

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出stable rank作为无需标注的内在质量信号，通过模型表示的有效维度来衡量回答质量，并基于此开发SR-GRPO强化学习方法，在无外部监督下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法依赖外部监督存在诸多问题：人工标注稀缺且主观，奖励模型易受奖励攻击，自评估方法对提示敏感且有偏见。需要寻找无需外部监督的内在质量信号。

Method: 提出stable rank概念，通过计算隐藏状态总方差与主导方向方差的比值来测量表示的有效维度，捕捉信息在表示维度上的分布特征。基于此开发SR-GRPO（Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization），将stable rank作为强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: stable rank在RewardBench上达到84.04%准确率，通过Best-of-N采样比贪婪解码平均提升11.3个百分点。SR-GRPO在无外部监督下，将Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct在STEM任务上提升10%，数学推理提升19%，优于学习奖励模型和自评估基线。

Conclusion: 质量信号可以从模型内部几何结构中提取，为无需外部监督的可扩展对齐提供了一条新路径。stable rank作为内在质量信号具有实用价值。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT为评估LLM在中医辨证论治临床能力提供了全面基准，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，有助于推动中医智能化发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

Conclusion: 系统提示优化是实现准确、鲁棒的多语言大语言模型行为的可扩展路径，通过优化提示可以显著提升模型在多语言环境中的表现。

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了BLP 2025共享任务中的孟加拉语仇恨言论检测，比较了传统机器学习方法和基于Transformer的模型，发现语言特定的预训练模型BanglaBERT表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为拥有超过2.3亿使用者的语言，在计算资源中代表性不足，特别是在社交媒体自动审核方面存在迫切需求。低资源语言的仇恨言论识别面临数据集不足、拼写异质性和语言多样性等挑战。

Method: 研究复制了官方基线方法（多数类、随机、支持向量机），并增加了逻辑回归、随机森林和决策树作为基线。同时使用了基于Transformer的模型：DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行仇恨言论分类。

Result: 所有基于Transformer的模型（除DistilBERT外）在子任务中都优于基线方法。在Transformer模型中，BanglaBERT在两个子任务中都表现最佳，尽管模型规模较小，但优于m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa。

Conclusion: 语言特定的预训练对于低资源语言非常重要。BanglaBERT的优异表现强调了为孟加拉语等低资源语言开发预训练语言模型的潜力和必要性。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages remains a difficult problem due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

Result: 在AIME和GPQA上匹配或超越多数投票法；在LiveCodeBench（hard）上，DeepCoder-14B-Preview的pass@1提升+8.28%，Qwen3-8B提升+7.58%；在网络深度研究代理（WebSailor-7B/32B）上，在GAIA、BrowseComp-en/zh和XbenchDeepSearch等基准上均有提升

Conclusion: 并行测试时扩展可以在不依赖完整输出投票的情况下有益于开放式推理，ThinkMerge为开放端推理任务提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

*Amr Mohamed,Yang Zhang,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SchED是一种无需训练、模型无关的早期退出算法，通过聚合全跨度logit边界并在满足平滑的进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码，显著加速扩散大语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)相比自回归模型具有潜力，但其迭代采样过程缓慢，严重限制了实际应用。需要一种能够在不损失性能的情况下显著加速dLLM解码的方法。

Method: SchED是一种训练免费、模型无关的早期退出算法。它聚合全跨度logit边界，当满足平滑的进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码。算法通过分析模型token预测的熵来利用指令微调加速预测熵衰减的特性。

Result: 在指令微调模型上，SchED实现了3.8-4.0倍的加速，同时保持99.8-100%的基线分数。在基础模型上，提供一致的加速增益，性能保留99.1-100%，在更激进设置下可达2.34倍加速。在惩罚质量损失的保守速度指标(QPS, γ=4)下，SchED明显优于先前的基于置信度的早期退出方法。

Conclusion: SchED通过将真正的置信度稳定转化为计算节省，使dLLM解码显著更高效。该方法在保持性能的同时大幅加速推理，解决了dLLMs实际应用中的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

TL;DR: AutoNeural：针对NPU硬件特性设计的视觉-语言模型架构，通过替换ViT为MobileNetV5风格骨干网和集成SSM原理的混合语言模型，实现整数量化稳定性和线性时间推理，显著提升边缘AI效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有为GPU设计的视觉-语言模型在NPU上表现不佳，主要因为ViT量化脆弱性和自回归注意力机制的I/O限制，无法充分利用NPU的高算术吞吐量，需要专门为NPU约束重新设计模型架构。

Method: 1) 用MobileNetV5风格的深度可分离卷积骨干网替代标准ViT编码器，确保激活分布有界以实现稳定的INT4/8/16量化；2) 语言骨干网集成状态空间模型原理与Transformer层，使用高效门控卷积实现线性时间复杂性，消除生成过程中的KV缓存内存I/O开销。

Result: 相比传统基线：视觉编码器量化误差降低7倍，端到端延迟降低14倍，解码速度提升3倍，上下文窗口长度增加4倍。在Qualcomm SA8295P SoC上的真实汽车案例验证了驾驶舱应用的实时性能。

Conclusion: 为NPU约束重新设计模型拓扑是实现鲁棒多模态边缘智能的前提条件，AutoNeural通过硬件-模型协同设计展示了在NPU上实现高效视觉-语言推理的可行性。

Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个结合传统NLP技术和微调语言模型的框架，将英文句子转换为逻辑表达式再转为CNF形式，用于可满足性求解，减少LLM在逻辑翻译中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自然语言到形式逻辑的自动翻译中存在幻觉问题，而逻辑翻译任务需要高精度，这阻碍了在自动推理、软件规范验证等领域的应用。

Method: 结合传统NLP技术（自定义语法）、符号计算库和微调的语言模型，构建一个将英文句子转换为逻辑表达式，再翻译为合取范式（CNF）的框架。

Result: 微调后的模型能够有意识地纠正原始模型的相同类型幻觉，提供可靠的CNF生成，在早期实验中表现出良好效果。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合传统技术和微调LLM，有效减少了逻辑翻译中的幻觉问题，为自动推理和软件验证提供了可靠的形式逻辑转换方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoCoP是一个无数据集、闭环的道德一致性评估框架，用于持续评估和解释LLMs的道德稳定性，通过自主生成、评估和精炼道德场景来捕捉模型的长期道德行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐框架依赖静态数据集和事后评估，难以捕捉道德推理在不同上下文或时间尺度上的演变，需要一种动态、连续的方法来评估LLMs的道德一致性。

Method: 提出道德一致性管道(MoCoP)，包含三个支持层：(i)词汇完整性分析，(ii)语义风险估计，(iii)基于推理的判断建模，采用自维持架构自主生成、评估和精炼道德场景，无需外部监督。

Result: 在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上的实验显示，MoCoP有效捕捉长期道德行为，发现道德维度与毒性维度呈强负相关(rET = -0.81, p < 0.001)，与响应延迟接近零相关(rEL ≈ 0)。

Conclusion: 道德一致性和语言安全是模型行为的稳定可解释特征，MoCoP将道德评估重构为动态、模型无关的道德内省形式，为可扩展的持续审计提供了可重复基础，推进了自主AI系统中计算道德的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLM-Verifier收敛定理，为LLM辅助的形式验证提供首个具有可证明终止性和收敛性保证的正式框架，通过马尔可夫链建模和大量实验验证理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用大语言模型进行形式验证的方法缺乏可靠的理论基础，导致验证过程不稳定（可能收敛、循环或发散），需要建立具有可证明保证的正式框架。

Method: 将LLM与验证器的交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，关键参数为错误减少概率δ。提出收敛定理证明对任意δ>0，过程几乎必然达到验证状态，且期望迭代次数有界E[n]≤4/δ。

Result: 理论预测在超过90,000次试验中得到验证：所有运行都达到验证，收敛因子Cf≈1.0，理论界限与实际行为一致。基于此将工作流划分为边际、实用和高性能三个操作区域。

Conclusion: 理论保证和实验证据为LLM辅助验证提供了清晰的架构基础，工程师可获得支持可预测资源规划和性能预算的框架，特别适用于安全关键软件环境。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图是常见的流程沟通工具，但通常以静态图像形式分享，难以编辑或重用。需要一种方法将静态流程图转换为可编辑的文本表示形式。

Method: 使用详细系统提示和视觉语言模型，通过轻量级Web系统将流程图图像转换为Mermaid.js代码。界面支持混合主动式细化，包括内联文本编辑、拖放节点插入以及由集成AI助手解释的自然语言命令。

Result: 系统能够生成结构化、版本可控的文本表示，并与渲染的图表保持同步。引入了评估指标来评估多个模型的结构准确性、流程正确性、语法有效性和完整性。

Conclusion: 与之前的图像到图表工具不同，该方法产生结构化、版本可控的文本表示，为流程图的可编辑性和重用性提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

TL;DR: 提出一个分解复杂世界模型（用transducer表示）的框架，通过模块化分解实现并行化和可解释性，为AI安全和高效推理提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界模型通常计算需求高，但真实场景往往包含模块化交互的子组件。为了在AI安全要求的结构透明性和实际推理所需的计算效率之间搭建桥梁，需要开发能够分解复杂世界模型的框架。

Method: 开发了一个分解transducer（一种推广POMDP的模型类）表示的复杂世界模型的框架。该方法能够将transducer分解为在独立输入-输出子空间上运行的子transducer，从而支持并行化和可解释的替代方案。

Result: 提出了一个能够将复杂世界模型分解为模块化子组件的框架，实现了并行化推理和更好的可解释性，为分布式推理提供了支持。

Conclusion: 该框架为连接AI安全所需的结构透明性和实际推理所需的计算效率奠定了基础，通过模块化分解复杂世界模型，支持并行化、可解释的分布式推理。

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

TL;DR: STRIDE框架帮助决定何时使用完全自主的AI代理，通过任务分解、动态性评估和自反思需求分析来生成代理适用性分数，避免不必要的复杂代理部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着从无状态大语言模型向自主目标驱动代理的快速转变，需要解决一个核心问题：何时真正需要代理式AI？不加区分地部署代理会导致成本、复杂性和风险增加。

Method: 提出STRIDE框架，通过结构化任务分解、动态性归因和自反思需求分析，生成代理适用性分数，在三种模式间提供原则性推荐：直接LLM调用、引导式AI助手、完全自主的代理式AI。

Result: 在30个真实世界任务中，STRIDE在模式选择上达到92%准确率，减少45%不必要的代理部署，降低37%资源成本。6个月专家验证确认其实际效用。

Conclusion: 将代理采用重新定义为必要性驱动的设计决策，确保自主性仅在收益证明成本合理时应用，避免过度使用复杂代理系统。

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

Motivation: 现代工作依赖数字协作工具，但常规流程仍受人为错误和延迟困扰。需要研究通用LLM代理能否在财富管理领域准确经济地完成助理级任务，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 扩展TheAgentCompany平台，构建金融专注环境；引入合成领域数据，丰富同事模拟，原型化自动任务生成管道；创建包含12个任务对的财富管理助理基准测试，涵盖检索、分析、综合/沟通任务，包含明确验收标准和确定性评分器；引入高低自主性任务变体。

Conclusion: 通用LLM代理在财富管理任务中面临的主要挑战是工作流可靠性而非数学能力，自主性水平是关键影响因素，需要改进评估方法以建立有效的基准测试。

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

Motivation: LLM驱动的交易代理在真实金融市场中部署越来越多，但在对抗性或故障条件下的可靠性和鲁棒性尚未得到充分检验，而金融环境具有高风险和不可逆性。

Method: 提出TradeTrap框架，针对自主交易代理的四个核心组件（市场情报、策略制定、投资组合和账本处理、交易执行）进行系统级扰动测试，在真实美股市场数据的闭环历史回测环境中进行公平可重复的比较。

Result: 实验表明，单个组件的小扰动可以通过代理决策循环传播，导致极端集中、失控敞口和大幅投资组合回撤，证明当前自主交易代理在系统层面容易被系统性误导。

Conclusion: 当前自主交易代理在系统级扰动下存在鲁棒性缺陷，TradeTrap框架为评估和改进交易代理的可靠性提供了系统化方法。

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在感知、语言、推理和多模态领域取得快速进展，但现代AI系统在自我监控、自我纠正和动态环境中自主调节行为方面仍存在根本性限制。这些限制阻碍了AI实现稳健泛化、终身适应性和真实世界自主性。

Method: 通过识别和分析七大核心缺陷：缺乏内在自我监控、元认知意识不足、固定非自适应学习机制、无法重构目标、缺乏表征维护、不足的具身反馈、缺乏内在能动性。结合人工系统与生物认知的比较分析，整合AI研究、认知科学和神经科学的见解。

Result: 当前架构（包括深度学习和基于Transformer的系统）存在结构性限制，仅靠扩展规模无法解决这些问题。这些缺陷导致AI无法实现真正的自主适应、动态表征管理和目标导向行为。

Conclusion: 需要向认知基础的AI（认知自主性）进行范式转变，实现自我导向适应、动态表征管理和有意图的目标导向行为，同时配备改革性监督机制，确保自主系统保持可解释性、可治理性并与人类价值观对齐。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DialogGuard是一个多智能体框架，用于评估LLM在心理健康等敏感场景中的心理社会风险，包含五种高风险维度，通过四种LLM-as-a-judge流程实现更准确的风险检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地应用于心理健康、危机干预等情感敏感服务，但其在这些场景中的心理社会安全性尚未得到充分理解和评估，存在潜在风险。

Method: 提出DialogGuard多智能体框架，评估LLM生成回复在五个高风险维度（隐私侵犯、歧视行为、心理操纵、心理伤害、侮辱行为）的风险。采用四种LLM-as-a-judge流程：单智能体评分、双智能体校正、多智能体辩论、随机多数投票，基于共享的三级评分标准。

Result: 使用PKU-SafeRLHF数据集验证，多智能体机制比非LLM基线和单智能体评分更准确地检测心理社会风险。双智能体校正和多数投票在准确性、与人工评分对齐、鲁棒性方面达到最佳平衡，而辩论机制召回率更高但会过度标记边界案例。

Conclusion: DialogGuard作为开源软件发布，提供Web界面和可解释的自然语言理由，支持从业者进行提示设计、审计和监督面向脆弱用户的Web应用，提高LLM在敏感场景中的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型恢复（MR）对于关键任务自主系统的安全可解释决策很重要，但在边缘设备上部署受到神经ODE迭代特性的阻碍，FPGA上效率低下，内存和能耗是主要问题

Method: 提出MERINDA框架，用并行化神经架构替代神经ODE的迭代求解器，专门针对FPGA优化，实现高效的模型恢复

Result: 相比移动GPU，MERINDA实现近11倍更低的DRAM使用和2.2倍更快的运行时间，在固定精度下揭示内存与能耗的逆相关关系

Conclusion: MERINDA适合资源受限、需要实时操作的关键任务自主系统，解决了边缘设备上模型恢复的内存和能耗问题

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

TL;DR: 仅用599张训练图像实现95.5% Dice分数的乳腺细胞分割框架，通过量子启发边缘增强、稳定多组件损失函数和复杂度加权采样解决严重类别不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注需要大量时间和专家知识，乳腺上皮细胞核数据集标注需要病理学家投入数百小时。现有方法面临严重类别不平衡挑战（乳腺组织仅占4%像素，60%图像无乳腺区域）

Method: 1) 多尺度Gabor滤波器量子启发边缘增强创建第四输入通道；2) 集成自适应Dice损失与边界感知项的稳定多组件损失函数；3) 复杂度加权采样优先处理困难区域；4) EfficientNet-B7/UNet++架构配合4到3通道投影；5) 指数移动平均和统计异常值检测进行稳健验证

Result: Dice分数95.5% ± 0.3%，IoU 91.2% ± 0.4%。量子增强提升边界精度2.1%，加权采样增加小病灶检测3.8%。仅用599张训练图像实现突破性性能

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少医学专家标注时间，解决了临床感知AI开发中的基本瓶颈，为有限标注下的医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

Motivation: 全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）处理多种模态数据带来了新的安全挑战，现有安全护栏研究主要针对单模态设置，且通常采用二元分类框架，限制了在不同模态和任务间的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出OmniGuard框架，构建包含21万多样本的全模态安全数据集，涵盖所有模态的单模态和跨模态样本，通过专家模型蒸馏生成结构化安全标签和安全评析。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，OmniGuard在多种多模态安全场景下展现出强大的有效性和泛化能力，为全模态安全系统提供了统一框架。

Conclusion: OmniGuard通过统一框架在全模态上执行安全策略和风险缓解，为构建更鲁棒和强大的全模态安全系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReMindView-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在多视角空间推理中的表现，发现现有模型在跨视角对齐和视角采取得分较低，揭示了模型在构建空间心理模型方面的系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在多视角空间推理中难以保持几何一致性和跨视角一致性，缺乏能够隔离多视角推理与单视角感知和时间因素的细粒度基准测试。

Method: 提出了ReMindView-Bench基准测试，系统性地变化视角空间模式和查询类型来探测空间认知的关键因素。使用LLM-as-a-judge和自一致性提示进行显式分阶段分析，以及线性探测和熵动态进行隐式分析。

Result: 评估了15个当前VLMs，发现它们在跨视角对齐和视角采取得分上存在一致性的失败。模型在单帧感知上表现良好，但在跨视角信息整合时性能急剧下降。隐式分析显示任务相关信息逐渐丢失，正确与错误轨迹之间的不确定性分离。

Conclusion: ReMindView-Bench为VLM空间推理提供了认知基础的诊断，揭示了多视角空间心理模型在推理过程中如何形成、退化和失稳。该基准测试有助于深入理解VLMs的空间推理能力缺陷。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的生成式智能体MMO模拟系统，用于优化游戏数值系统和机制设计，相比传统方法更真实、可解释且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MMO游戏优化方法依赖大规模在线实验或基于预定义统计模型的参数调优，成本高、耗时长且可能破坏玩家体验。简化离线模拟系统保真度有限，无法准确模拟真实玩家的推理和干预反应。

Method: 提出基于LLM的生成式智能体MMO模拟系统：1）使用大规模真实玩家行为数据通过监督微调和强化学习将LLM从通用先验适配到游戏特定领域；2）基于真实游戏日志训练数据驱动的环境模型重建动态游戏系统。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的生成式智能体模拟系统能够有效解决传统MMO优化方法的局限性，提供更真实、可解释且成本效益更高的数值设计优化方案。

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

TL;DR: 研究探索用监督学习结合人工错误注入来培养语言模型自我纠错能力，但发现该方法效果有限，无法显著提升性能，反而会因分布偏移导致纠错能力下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习已成为激发大语言模型推理和自我纠错能力的主要方法，但计算成本高昂，因此需要探索替代方案。受自动驾驶和机器人技术的启发，研究是否可以通过监督学习结合人工错误注入来诱导语言模型的自我纠错能力。

Method: 在推理链中插入人工错误，将其掩盖，然后监督模型识别和纠正这些错误。通过监督学习的方式训练模型，而不是使用强化学习。

Result: 该方法即使在简单的合成任务上也无法显著提升多个模型的性能。即使模型发现了自己的错误，也常常只是重复原始错误。研究发现，从合成错误到策略错误的分布偏移会显著降低微调模型的纠错能力，即使合成错误覆盖了策略错误。

Conclusion: 研究结果解释了为什么策略强化学习方法在激发自我纠错方面特别有效，而监督学习结合人工错误注入的方法效果有限，突显了分布偏移问题的挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测市场存在碎片化问题，包括重叠问题、隐含等价关系和隐藏矛盾，需要自动方法来发现市场间的潜在语义结构

Method: 开发AI代理管道：1) 使用自然语言理解对合约文本和元数据进行聚类，形成主题群组；2) 识别群组内市场对之间的依赖关系，包括相同结果（正相关）和不同结果（负相关）关系

Result: AI识别的市场关系准确率达到60-70%，基于这些关系构建的简单交易策略在周度时间范围内获得约20%的平均回报

Conclusion: 代理AI和大语言模型能够有效发现预测市场中的潜在语义结构，为市场分析和交易策略提供有价值的信息

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI自进化系统在实践中存在概念漂移、多样性崩溃和错误进化等问题，导致模型性能快速停滞甚至退化。需要一种能够稳定、可控地进行自进化，同时最小化人类监督依赖的方法。

Method: 提出R-Few框架，包含挑战者-求解器自博弈机制：挑战者使用少量人类标注样本指导合成问题生成；求解器在基于难度的在线课程下，联合训练人类和合成样本。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中，R-Few实现了一致且迭代的改进。例如，Qwen3-8B-Base在数学任务上比R-Zero提高了3.0分，性能与使用20倍人类数据训练的General-Reasoner相当。

Conclusion: R-Few通过接地气的挑战者训练和基于课程的求解器训练，缓解了概念漂移问题，实现了更稳定、可控的协同进化动态，为AI自进化提供了有效框架。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的上下文信息，但其非结构化特性限制了在传统预测模型中的应用。需要开发能够利用这些信息进行卒中结局预测的实用工具。

Method: 开发了两步链式思维框架COPE：第一步生成临床推理，第二步输出改良Rankin量表预测。基于LLaMA-3-8B开源模型，比较了GPT-4.1、ClinicalBERT、结构化变量机器学习模型和单步LLM。

Result: COPE的MAE为1.01，±1准确率74.4%，精确准确率32.8%，与GPT-4.1相当，优于其他方法。在不同亚组中表现一致，在老年患者、接受血栓切除术患者和较长摘要患者中误差略高。

Conclusion: COPE作为轻量级、可解释、保护隐私的开源框架，为从非结构化临床文本进行结局预测提供了准确实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger验证了编辑器原生、智能体驱动的写作助手的实用性，为学术写作提供了深度集成的AI辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

Motivation: 解决静态硬编码代理工作流的局限性，传统系统需要预定义图或专门编程，无法灵活适应开放任务。

Result: 在kragent.ai系统中成功部署，展示了实际工作流中的定性证据，而非详尽基准测试结果。

Conclusion: IACT模型通过动态代理拓扑和双向对话机制，有效解决了传统工作流的僵化问题，实现了更灵活、可扩展的自主系统。

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

Method: 提出TACDA方法：1）在对抗自适应过程中加入目标域重构策略，在提取域不变特征的同时保留目标域特定信息；2）开发新颖的聚类配对策略，实现相似退化阶段之间的一致性对齐。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，TACDA方法在两个不同的评估指标上均显著优于现有最先进方法，表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: TACDA方法有效解决了跨域RUL预测中的域差异问题，通过结合目标域重构和退化阶段一致性对齐，在保持目标域特定信息的同时实现了更好的域自适应效果。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将LTL指令解释为有限自动机的方法，在多个原子命题同时为真且可能以复杂方式交互的环境中表现不佳，需要新的方法来处理这种复杂性。

Method: 提出基于简单布尔公式序列的条件策略，这些公式直接对应自动机中的转移，并通过图神经网络编码以生成结构化任务表示。

Result: 在复杂的基于象棋的环境中进行的实验证明了该方法的优势。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多个高级事件同时发生且复杂交互的环境，为LTL指令下的强化学习提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了Transformer模型在深度泛化（处理比训练时更深的嵌套结构）方面的局限性，并提出了一种新颖的循环定位-替换流水线方法来解决递归推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在许多任务上表现出色，但在处理递归推理问题时面临显著挑战。虽然已有研究广泛探讨了长度泛化（处理比训练时更长的序列），但深度泛化（处理比训练时更深的嵌套层次）这一独特且未被充分探索的局限性尚未得到深入研究。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的循环定位-替换流水线方法，将递归问题分解为可管理的子组件。该方法使用两个专门模型：定位器识别可解决的子表达式，替换器评估这些组件同时保持整体结构。

Result: 在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑三个精心设计的领域中评估了该方法，每个领域都有可控的递归深度。结果表明，该方法在测试超出分布范围的递归深度时，有效缓解了性能衰减问题。

Conclusion: 标准Transformer架构在处理比训练时更深的递归问题时存在局限性，这源于其无法维持类似栈的行为来跟踪和解决多层嵌套依赖。提出的循环定位-替换流水线方法为解决深度泛化问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

TL;DR: MIGR框架通过模态重要性引导推理，改善多模态大语言模型的情感理解可靠性，减少推理漂移问题

Motivation: 现有方法存在推理漂移问题：模型逐渐依赖自身生成的文本而非多模态证据，且解释过度受视觉主导推理路径影响，导致情感理解不可靠

Method: 提出模态重要性机制识别情感主导模态，基于此重组推理序列；采用两阶段框架：模态对齐监督微调和模态感知奖励优化

Result: 在DFEW基准上显著提升推理可靠性，将正确预测但情感不一致解释的比例从18.10%降至7.37%

Conclusion: 从情感主导模态开始推理能有效改善多模态情感理解的可靠性和一致性

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题影响全球数亿人，但早期检测仍有限制。虽然大语言模型在心理健康应用中有潜力，但其规模和计算需求阻碍实际部署。小语言模型提供了轻量级替代方案，但在基于社交媒体的心理健康预测方面研究不足。

Method: 引入Menta模型，采用LoRA微调框架、跨数据集策略和平衡准确率导向的损失函数，在六个分类任务上进行联合训练，专门针对社交媒体数据进行心理健康预测优化。

Result: 相比9个最先进的小语言模型基线，Menta在抑郁、压力和自杀倾向等任务上平均提升15.2%；在抑郁和压力分类任务上比130亿参数的大语言模型精度更高，同时模型大小减少约3.25倍；可在iPhone 15 Pro Max上实时部署，仅需约3GB内存。

Conclusion: Menta展示了轻量级小语言模型在心理健康监测方面的潜力，支持可扩展、隐私保护的实时设备端部署，为心理健康早期检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测面临市场波动性和对实时事件的敏感性挑战。虽然大语言模型为基于文本的预测提供了新途径，但在金融领域的应用受到噪声新闻数据和文本中缺乏明确答案的限制。通用记忆架构难以识别价格变动的关键驱动因素。

Method: 提出StockMem事件-反思双层记忆框架：1）将新闻结构化处理为事件；2）水平维度整合每日事件；3）纵向维度追踪事件演化以提取反映市场预期差异的增量信息，构建时序事件知识库；4）通过分析事件-价格动态形成因果经验的反思知识库；5）预测时检索类似历史场景，结合当前事件、增量数据和过去经验进行推理。

Result: 实验表明StockMem优于现有记忆架构，通过追踪影响价格的信息链提供更优且可解释的推理，增强了金融预测的决策透明度。

Conclusion: StockMem通过事件-反思双层记忆框架有效解决了股票价格预测中的关键挑战，不仅提升了预测性能，还提供了可解释的推理过程，增强了金融预测的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

Motivation: 现有AAI能力评分是静态函数，需要扩展到动态系统以建模智能体在计算资源变化下的演化过程，为自改进机制提供理论框架。

Method: 将智能体形式化为参数化流ν_r，由GVU算子控制，证明该算子在参数流形Θ上生成向量场，将自改进系数κ定义为能力泛函沿该流的李导数，推导出保证稳定性的方差不等式谱条件。

Result: 证明了自改进κ>0的充分条件是生成和验证的联合噪声足够小，将STaR、SPIN、Reflexion、GANs、AlphaZero等架构统一为满足方差不等式的GVU算子的具体拓扑实现。

Conclusion: 建立了动态自改进系统的统一理论框架，为理解各种自改进架构提供了数学基础，方差不等式为设计稳定自改进系统提供了指导原则。

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

Abstract: Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

Abstract: Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance. To improve prediction performance, both individual models and ensemble techniques such as stacking were investigated. The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.The stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision. In our study, we proposed and developed a React Native-based application with a Python Flask backend to support early diabetes prediction, providing users with an accessible and efficient health monitoring tool.

TL;DR: VoxCap：基于药效团的体素生成模型，解决传统基于药效团的虚拟筛选的扩展性和生成性问题，显著提升新分子生成效率和多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于药效团的虚拟筛选方法存在两个主要问题：1）随着分子库规模增大，计算成本急剧增加；2）只能从现有化合物库中筛选，无法生成全新分子。需要开发既能高效搜索又能生成新分子的方法。

Method: 提出VoxCap方法，一种基于体素标注的生成模型，能从体素化的分子表示生成SMILES字符串。设计了两种工作流程：1）从头设计：生成与查询分子具有高药效团-形状相似性的新分子；2）快速搜索：将生成设计与廉价的2D子结构相似性搜索结合，实现高效命中识别。

Result: VoxCap在生成多样化从头命中分子方面显著优于先前方法。结合快速搜索工作流程后，计算时间减少了几个数量级，同时为所有查询分子返回命中结果，能够搜索传统暴力搜索无法处理的大型分子库。

Conclusion: VoxCap成功解决了传统基于药效团的虚拟筛选的扩展性和生成性问题，为药物发现提供了更高效、更具创造性的工具，特别是在从头分子设计和大型库搜索方面表现出色。

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

Conclusion: PIBNet为多重散射问题提供了一种高效的学习替代方案，能够克服传统边界元方法的主要计算瓶颈，具有良好的泛化性能

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

TL;DR: 提出SFL Transformer，通过上下文门控机制在BERT编码器中间层融合辅助结构特征，显著提升歌词内容分类性能，准确率达0.9910。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征融合方法通常在最终输出层结合结构特征和语义特征，但这种方法可能无法充分利用两者的协同效应。作者假设在Transformer中间层注入辅助上下文信息能更有效地结合结构和语义信息。

Method: 提出SFL Transformer模型，采用上下文门控机制（Intermediate SFL）在BERT编码器堆栈中间层调制隐藏状态序列。该方法使用低维结构特征（Fstruct）调制深度上下文语义特征（Hseq），而不是在最终输出层融合特征。

Result: 在基于UMAP降维歌词嵌入的二元分类任务中，SFL Transformer达到0.9910的准确率和宏F1分数，显著超越先前SFL模型（0.9894）。模型同时保持高可靠性：预期校准误差0.0081，对数损失0.0489。

Conclusion: 验证了在Transformer中间层注入辅助上下文信息是结合结构和语义信息的最有效方式，创造了兼具优异判别能力和高保真概率估计的模型。

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中，数据的主导频率会随时间演变而偏移，传统固定专家数量的MoE模型难以适应这种变化，导致频率覆盖不平衡问题：专家太少会忽略关键信息，太多会引入噪声。

Method: 提出Ada-MoGE模型，集成频谱强度和频率响应来自适应确定专家数量，确保与输入数据的频率分布对齐；使用高斯带通滤波平滑分解频域特征，避免直接频带截断引入噪声。

Result: 在6个公开基准测试中取得最先进性能，仅使用20万参数。

Conclusion: Ada-MoGE通过自适应专家选择和频域特征优化，有效解决了传统MoE模型的频率覆盖不平衡问题，在多元时间序列预测中表现出色。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

Conclusion: DPWMixer通过无损小波分解和双路径处理，有效解决了长时序预测中的频谱混叠和信息丢失问题，实现了高效准确的预测性能。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了四种定价算法在三种双寡头市场模型和不同需求冲击下的竞争行为，发现强化学习算法在稳定需求下能维持超竞争价格，DDPG最具合谋倾向，而需求冲击对不同市场结构的影响差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主定价算法日益影响数字市场竞争，但其在现实需求条件下的行为尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析算法、市场结构和随机需求如何共同影响竞争结果。

Method: 研究分析了四种定价算法（Q-Learning、PSO、Double DQN、DDPG）在三种经典双寡头模型（Logit、Hotelling、Linear）下的表现，使用自回归过程创建了多种需求冲击机制，并采用基于利润和价格的合谋指数来评估竞争结果。

Result: 强化学习算法在稳定需求下能维持超竞争价格，DDPG表现出最明显的合谋倾向。需求冲击对不同市场结构的影响各异：Logit市场性能显著下降，Hotelling市场保持稳定，Linear市场则出现冲击引发的利润膨胀。尽管绝对性能变化显著，但算法在不同环境中的相对排名保持一致。

Conclusion: 市场结构和需求不确定性对算法竞争具有关键影响，这些发现为围绕自主定价行为的政策讨论提供了重要见解，强调了在评估算法竞争时需要同时考虑算法特性和市场环境因素。

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

TL;DR: CLEF：一种利用临床风险评分进行自适应负对加权的对比学习方法，用于单导联心电图基础模型预训练，无需逐样本标注


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心电图基础模型预训练方法未充分利用临床元数据中的领域知识，限制了诊断性能的提升

Method: 提出临床引导对比学习方法，利用临床风险评分自适应加权负对，将心电图嵌入相似性与临床有意义的患者差异对齐，并处理缺失元数据

Result: 在7个测试数据集的18个临床任务中，CLEF在分类任务上AUROC平均提升至少2.6%，回归任务上MAE平均降低至少3.2%，优于5个基础模型基准和3个自监督算法

Conclusion: CLEF实现了更准确、可扩展的单导联心电图分析，推动了远程健康监测的发展，代码和预训练模型已开源

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

TL;DR: OSAE通过建立严格的潜在特征排序和确定性使用每个特征维度，解决了稀疏自编码器特征不一致的问题，改进了Matryoshka SAEs方法。

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在神经网络可解释性中广泛使用，但其学习到的特征在不同随机种子和超参数设置下存在不一致性，这影响了特征的可比性和可靠性。

Method: 提出有序稀疏自编码器，扩展Matryoshka SAEs：1）建立严格的潜在特征排序；2）确定性使用每个特征维度，避免先前嵌套SAE方法中的采样近似。

Result: 理论上证明OSAE解决了稀疏字典学习中排列不可识别性问题；在Gemma2-2B和Pythia-70M模型上的实验表明，相比Matryoshka基线，OSAE能提高特征一致性。

Conclusion: OSAE通过引入特征排序和确定性维度使用，有效解决了稀疏自编码器特征不一致问题，为神经网络可解释性提供了更可靠的特征表示方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

Method: 通过微调在音乐音频上预训练的VampNet（掩码声学标记模型），使用过去20年收集的10k个coda录音。采用迭代掩码标记预测方法生成合成codas。

Result: WhAM生成高保真合成codas，保留源录音的关键声学特征。在节奏、社交单元和元音分类等下游任务中，WhAM学习的表征表现出色，尽管模型是为生成而非分类任务训练的。

Conclusion: WhAM是首个能够从音频提示生成合成抹香鲸codas的Transformer模型，生成的音频质量高，且学习到的表征在下游分类任务中表现良好，为鲸鱼声学研究和保护提供了新工具。

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在支持低资源语言（特别是非洲语言）时面临挑战，主要原因是缺乏高质量的指令数据集。现有方法如自动翻译和合成数据生成常产生不流畅或不一致的结果。

Method: 提出InstructLR框架，结合LLM驱动的文本生成和双重质量过滤：基于检索增强生成（RAG）的n-shot提示自动过滤层，以及人工验证层。从MMLU等基准中汲取任务定义灵感。

Result: 成功创建了三个多领域指令基准：ZarmaInstruct-50k、BambaraInstruct-50k和FulfuldeInstruct-50k，每个包含5万个高质量指令数据。

Conclusion: InstructLR框架有效解决了低资源语言高质量指令数据集生成的难题，为支持非洲等地区低资源语言的大语言模型应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

Abstract: We study the problem of online model selection in reinforcement learning, where the selector has access to a class of reinforcement learning agents and learns to adaptively select the agent with the right configuration. Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence safety-critical aspects of society, from medical diagnosis to autonomous mobility, making uncertainty awareness a central requirement for trustworthy AI. We present a photonic Bayesian machine that leverages the inherent randomness of chaotic light sources to enable uncertainty reasoning within the framework of Bayesian Neural Networks. The analog processor features a 1.28 Tbit/s digital interface compatible with PyTorch, enabling probabilistic convolutions processing within 37.5 ps per convolution. We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 传统基于距离的层次聚类方法已被基于复杂分子进化模型的贝叶斯和最大似然搜索方法取代，但这些方法计算复杂。需要开发计算量小、可扩展到大量分类群和分子特征的方法

Method: 设计最小神经网络架构来近似经典系统发育距离函数，学习各种分子进化模型下的距离，相比基于模型的推理和最近提出的卷积/Transformer网络，计算足迹小

Result: 学习的距离函数泛化能力强，在适当的训练数据集下，结果可与最先进的推理方法相媲美

Conclusion: 最小神经网络架构能够有效近似系统发育距离函数，具有计算效率高、可扩展性好的优势，为大规模系统发育分析提供了新方法

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

TL;DR: 研究探讨公平性约束如何影响机器学习模型的可解释性，特别是SHAP特征重要性排名的稳定性，发现公平性改进会显著改变特征重要性排名，且在不同群体间变化方式不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域可信机器学习需要预测性能、公平性和可解释性三者兼备。虽然已知提高公平性会影响预测性能，但公平性改进如何影响可解释性（临床信任的关键要素）尚不清楚。临床医生可能不愿意依赖那些在应用公平性约束后解释发生变化的模型。

Method: 通过偏置缓解技术增强公平性，研究其对SHAP特征重要性排名的影响。在三个数据集上量化应用公平性约束后特征重要性排名的变化：儿科尿路感染风险、直接抗凝剂出血风险和再犯风险。同时评估多个模型类别在SHAP排名稳定性方面的表现。

Result: 提高种族亚组间的模型公平性会显著改变特征重要性排名，有时在不同群体间以不同方式变化。公平性约束的应用导致特征重要性排名发生实质性变化。

Conclusion: 需要在模型评估中联合考虑准确性、公平性和可解释性，而不是孤立地评估。公平性改进对可解释性的影响强调了在可信医疗机器学习中综合考虑这三个维度的必要性。

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

TL;DR: 本文证明在可测试学习模型中，成员查询（MQ）无法显著降低时间复杂性，且不能超越仅使用样本的分布特定学习算法。通过将布尔概念类的基于样本的证伪归约到带查询的可测试学习，建立了查询算法与PAC学习器之间的效率关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究成员查询在可测试学习模型中的效率限制，探索查询是否能显著加速学习过程，特别是在分布特定设置下。旨在理解查询能力与仅使用样本的学习算法之间的根本关系。

Method: 1. 提出从布尔概念类的基于样本证伪到带查询的可测试学习（TL-Q）的一般归约；2. 利用[KL18]中从学习到证伪的归约建立TL-Q的下界；3. 定义"统计"MQ算法类，证明TL-Q算法在该类中蕴含高效的统计查询证伪和学习算法。

Result: 1. 在可测试学习模型中，成员查询无法使算法比最佳m样本PAC学习器超多项式地更高效；2. 高效的统计查询证伪和学习算法与TL-Q算法存在等价关系；3. 结合已知的SQ维度下界，表明许多高效的成员查询学习器无法被"可测试化"。

Conclusion: 在可测试学习框架下，成员查询不能提供超越仅使用样本的分布特定学习算法的显著时间效率优势。许多已知的高效MQ学习器（如基于影响估计或子立方条件统计查询的方法）无法被转化为可测试学习算法，这揭示了查询能力与可测试性之间的基本权衡。

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了对称性无关模型学习对称性的速度和效果，提出了一个衡量等变误差的原则性方法，发现在3D旋转等变任务中，模型能快速学习到对称性（1k-10k步内误差≤2%），且学习对称性比主预测任务更容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强被广泛用于训练对称性无关模型，但模型学习尊重对称性的速度和效果仍不清楚。研究者希望量化模型学习对称性的过程，特别是对于3D旋转等变任务。

Method: 提出了一个原则性的等变误差度量方法（对于凸损失函数，计算总损失中由于学习对称性不完美导致的损失比例）。实证研究聚焦于高维分子任务（流匹配、力场预测、体素去噪）上的3D旋转等变性，分析了模型大小、数据集大小的影响，并研究了等变误差、学习梯度和模型参数之间的关系。

Result: 模型能快速减少等变误差，在1k-10k训练步内将误差降至≤2%的保留损失，这一结果对模型和数据集大小具有鲁棒性。学习3D旋转等变性比主预测任务更容易，具有更平滑、条件更好的损失景观。非等变模型的损失惩罚在整个训练过程中都很小，除非缩小等变模型的"效率差距"，否则它们在GPU小时内的测试损失可能更低。

Conclusion: 模型能快速有效地学习3D旋转对称性，因为这是一个相对容易的学习任务。等变模型的效率优势需要足够大才能抵消其计算开销，否则非等变模型在计算效率上可能更有优势。

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

Conclusion: 提出的SAL框架解决了玻尔兹曼机训练中的采样瓶颈，使更强大的玻尔兹曼机模型能够高效学习，扩展了能量基生成模型的应用范围

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强模型在流式监督学习中的概念漂移问题研究不足。在线分类在非平稳环境中面临挑战，需要有效利用过去数据来应对模式变化和概念漂移。

Method: 提出RAM-OL方法，扩展随机梯度下降，维护过去示例的小缓冲区。在每个时间步，在隐藏表示空间中检索当前输入的最近邻，并结合当前示例和检索到的邻居联合更新模型。比较朴素重放和门控重放两种变体，后者使用时窗、相似度阈值和梯度重加权来平衡过去数据的重用和过时模式的鲁棒性。

Result: 在强周期性漂移的数据流上，RAM-OL将预序准确性提高了约7个百分点，并大大减少了随机种子间的方差。在嘈杂的航空数据流上，门控变体与纯在线基线表现相当。理论分析表明检索可以降低适应成本并改善回归常数。

Conclusion: 检索增强记忆是处理概念漂移下在线学习的实用且鲁棒的工具，能够有效利用过去数据应对模式变化，在周期性漂移环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

Motivation: 现有离线联邦强化学习方法在面对混合质量数据（各客户端数据来自不同质量的行为策略）时性能急剧下降，需要解决这一限制

Method: 提出FOVA框架：1）使用投票机制在本地策略评估中识别高回报动作，减轻低质量行为数据影响；2）基于优势加权回归构建一致的本地和全局训练目标，提升效率和稳定性

Result: 理论分析证明FOVA学习的策略相比行为策略有严格改进；大量实验验证FOVA在广泛使用的基准测试上显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: FOVA通过投票机制有效处理混合质量数据问题，在离线联邦强化学习中实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

Motivation: 在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中，直接优化策略性能需要有效的梯度估计方法。传统方法通常需要了解底层状态信息或使用复杂的技术，而GPOMDP旨在提供一种更简单、更实用的解决方案。

Method: 提出GPOMDP算法，这是一种类似REINFORCE的算法，通过单一样本路径估计平均奖励相对于策略参数的梯度。算法仅需一个自由参数β∈[0,1)来平衡偏差-方差权衡，且不需要了解底层状态信息。

Conclusion: GPOMDP为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中的策略优化提供了一种简单有效的梯度估计方法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESACT是一个端到端稀疏加速器，通过局部相似性预测注意力稀疏性，在保持精度的同时减少52.03%计算量，能效达3.29 TOPS/W。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型计算成本高，现有加速器主要利用注意力中的行内稀疏性，很少考虑行间稀疏性。利用行间稀疏性的方法通常依赖昂贵的全局相似性估计，这会削弱稀疏性带来的加速效益，且通常只应用于一两个Transformer组件。

Method: 提出ESACT端到端稀疏加速器，核心是局部相似性稀疏性预测(SPLS)机制，利用HLog量化在QK生成前准确预测局部注意力稀疏性，实现所有Transformer组件的高效稀疏化。包含三项架构创新以支持高效硬件实现。

Result: 在26个基准测试中，SPLS减少总计算量52.03%，精度损失小于1%。ESACT实现端到端能效3.29 TOPS/W，注意力级能效比SOTA加速器SpAtten和Sanger分别提高2.95倍和2.26倍。

Conclusion: 局部相似性可实现低计算开销的端到端稀疏加速，ESACT通过SPLS机制和架构创新，在保持精度的同时显著提升Transformer计算效率，为计算密集型Transformer部署提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

Motivation: 城市交通拥堵日益严重，路边停车占用道路空间进一步阻碍交通流。随着车路协同技术的发展，需要探索如何通过动态配置路边停车位来最小化其对交通拥堵的影响

Method: 采用数据驱动方法，提出双层多智能体强化学习框架：车道级智能体使用结合LSTM和图注意力网络的深度Q学习架构优化各车道停车位配置；区块级智能体控制车道级智能体并维持区块周边足够停车位

Conclusion: 提出的动态路边停车位配置框架能有效缓解交通拥堵，在不大幅增加停车步行距离的前提下显著改善交通效率，为城市交通管理提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

TL;DR: 论文将数据管理形式化为采样分布重加权，并分析其对数据诱导算子特征结构的影响。主要发现：静态剪枝只能有限提升，不能改变渐近神经缩放；理想的时间相关数据管理可以加速学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同数据管理策略（数据剪枝、合成数据生成、跨模型蒸馏、RLHF、基于难度的采样）对大规模神经模型训练效率的影响。特别是理解为什么某些策略（如自生成合成数据）无法有效提升模型能力。

Method: 将数据管理形式化为采样分布的重加权，并将其影响映射到数据诱导算子的特征结构上。使用算子理论和谱分析来研究数据管理策略的数学特性。

Result: 1. 静态剪枝诱导有界算子，不能改变谱尾指数，只能提供有限区域改进，无法改变渐近神经缩放。2. 时间相关数据管理中，理想oracle（能跟踪谱残差并连续重归一化尾部）可证明加速学习，但实际系统只能近似这种行为。

Conclusion: 数据管理策略的效果取决于其对数据诱导算子特征结构的影响。静态方法有限，动态时间相关方法有潜力，但需要跟踪谱残差的能力。这为设计有效数据管理策略提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域离线强化学习方法仅关注动力学对齐，忽略了价值对齐的重要性。当源域和目标域存在动力学差异时，简单合并数据集会导致性能下降，需要同时考虑动力学和价值两个维度的对齐。

Method: 提出DVDF（动力学和价值对齐数据筛选）方法，从源域选择性地共享那些既具有高动力学对齐又具有高价值对齐的样本。通过理论分析证明了动力学对齐和价值对齐对策略学习的重要性。

Result: 在包括运动学和形态学变化在内的多种动力学偏移设置下，DVDF在多个任务和数据集上一致优于现有基线方法，在目标域仅含5000个转换的极低数据场景中也表现出色。

Conclusion: 动力学对齐和价值对齐都是跨域离线强化学习的关键因素。DVDF方法通过同时考虑这两个维度，能够有效筛选源域中的高质量样本，显著提升跨域策略学习性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在长上下文提示上的评估，而智能体设置（包括能力和安全性）相对未被探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，研究LLM智能体在长上下文环境中的表现。

Method: 通过评估LLM智能体在不同长度、类型和位置的上下文环境中的表现，分析任务性能和拒绝执行有害请求的变化。特别关注具有1M-2M token上下文窗口的模型在100K-200K token时的表现。

Result: LLM智能体对上下文长度、类型和位置敏感，表现出意外和不一致的任务性能变化和拒绝率变化。1M-2M token上下文窗口的模型在100K token时性能下降超过50%。拒绝率变化不可预测：GPT-4.1-nano从~5%增加到~40%，而Grok 4 Fast从~80%下降到~10%（200K token时）。

Conclusion: LLM智能体在长上下文环境中存在潜在安全问题，当前评估LLM智能体在长多步任务安全性的指标和范式需要重新审视。智能体在能力和安全性表现上与先前LLM评估存在显著差异。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

Motivation: 面对全球城市化和极端天气事件增加，高分辨率城市降雨监测对建设韧性智慧城市至关重要。传统基于物理模型的商业微波链路降雨反演方法在处理信号噪声和非线性衰减等现实复杂性问题时存在困难。

Result: 在瑞典哥德堡数据集（2015年6-9月）上验证，使用12个子链路和两个雨量计（Torp和Barl），测试期（8月22-31日）覆盖约10个降雨事件。TabGRU在Torp站点R²=0.91，Barl站点R²=0.96，优于深度学习基线，相比物理方法保持更高精度，有效缓解峰值降雨事件中的显著高估问题。

Conclusion: TabGRU模型能有效克服传统方法的局限性，在测试条件下为基于CML的城市降雨监测提供稳健准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体开发面临高推理成本问题，而微调方法开发周期长、提示工程试错成本高，需要一种既能降低成本又不增加开发摩擦的方法

Method: 提出上下文蒸馏：在每个智能体步骤中检索相关教师演示作为上下文示例，让学生模型实时模仿教师行为；结合自一致性级联来判断何时信任学生模型

Result: 在ALFWorld基准上，以2.5倍低成本达到教师级准确率（每轮成本从$0.059降至$0.024）；在AppWorld基准上，在相同准确率下实现2倍成本降低

Conclusion: 上下文蒸馏方法通过自适应策略实现了模型专业化的成本效益，同时保持了使用冻结模型的开发效率，使高级智能体系统在经济上对更广泛应用可行

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量网络方法解决了维度灾难问题，但特征超参数优化仍需依赖耗时的交叉验证，需要更高效的超参数学习方法

Method: 将张量积特征表示为可学习的CPD分解，利用ALS优化方法同时学习特征超参数和模型参数

Result: 在多种维度和规模的真实数据上，FL模型训练速度比标准交叉验证模型快3-5倍，预测质量相当

Conclusion: FL模型通过CPD结构有效学习特征超参数，显著提升训练效率，为大规模核方法应用提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

TL;DR: OptPO提出了一种自适应分配推理预算的测试时策略优化框架，通过贝叶斯序列概率比检验动态停止采样，显著减少计算冗余，同时保持或提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时策略优化方法依赖固定预算的多数投票来估计奖励，导致大量计算冗余。需要一种更高效的预算分配机制来减少推理开销。

Method: OptPO将投票过程建模为贝叶斯序列概率比检验，动态停止采样直到后验置信度超过阈值。保留的rollout用于策略更新，可与PPO或GRPO等算法无缝集成。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，OptPO相比固定样本基线显著减少了rollout开销，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: OptPO通过统一统计最优停止与测试时学习，为测试时适应提供了一个计算高效的范式。

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

Motivation: 即使像HGEMM这样性能关键且经过深度优化的CUDA内核，仍然可以通过自动化的方式进一步优化。传统的手动优化方法难以系统性地探索大规模配置空间，而LLM和RL的结合可以解决这一问题。

Method: 结合大型语言模型和强化学习，以CUDA执行速度作为RL奖励，自动优化半精度通用矩阵乘法内核。系统在1000种配置上进行优化探索。

Result: 在离线模式下：比torch.matmul快22.0%；比cuBLAS快19.2%；比cuBLASLt-heuristic快16.8%；比cuBLASLt-AutoTuning快11.4%。在服务器模式下：速度提升进一步增加到28.7%、26.0%、22.4%和15.9%。

Conclusion: CUDA-L2证明了即使是性能关键、经过深度优化的内核（如HGEMM），也可以通过LLM引导的RL自动化进行改进，系统性地探索人类难以处理的大规模配置空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

TL;DR: GoRL框架通过解耦优化与生成，使用可优化的潜在策略和条件生成解码器，在保持训练稳定性的同时实现高度表达的多模态策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中存在一个持续的矛盾：易于优化的策略通常过于简单，无法表示复杂控制所需的多模态动作分布。高斯策略虽然易于处理，但单模态形式限制了表达能力；而基于扩散或流匹配的生成策略虽然能建模丰富的多模态行为，但在在线RL中由于难以处理的似然和深度采样链中的噪声梯度而经常不稳定。

Method: GoRL框架基于"解耦优化与生成"的结构原则，优化一个可处理的潜在策略，同时使用条件生成解码器来合成动作。采用双时间尺度更新计划，使潜在策略能够稳定学习，而解码器则稳步提高表达能力，无需可处理的动作似然。

Result: 在一系列连续控制任务中，GoRL始终优于高斯策略和最近的生成策略基线。在HopperStand任务上，达到了870以上的归一化回报，是最强基线的3倍以上。

Conclusion: 将优化与生成分离为同时实现稳定性和高表达能力的策略提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

*Wenhao Sha,Tienchong Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeatTransFormer：基于物理引导的Transformer架构，用于解决界面主导的扩散问题，特别针对芯片-基板组装体中的热传导，能够处理陡峭的温度梯度并实现稳定收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体器件中的热传导主要由芯片和基板组装体主导，其中有限芯片层产生的热量会耗散到具有更高热物理性质的半无限基板中。这种不匹配会产生陡峭的界面温度梯度，使得瞬态热响应对界面高度敏感。传统的数值求解器需要过度离散化来解析这些动态，而物理信息神经网络（PINNs）通常在材料界面附近表现出不稳定的收敛和物理一致性损失。

Method: 引入HeatTransFormer，一种用于界面主导扩散问题的物理引导Transformer架构。该框架集成了：1）物理信息的时空采样；2）模拟解析扩散解的基于拉普拉斯的激活函数；3）支持双向时空耦合的无掩码注意力机制。这些组件使模型能够解析陡峭梯度、保持物理一致性，并在PINNs通常失败的地方保持稳定。

Result: HeatTransFormer在应用于有限层和半无限基板配置时，能够在界面两侧产生一致的温度场。结合物理约束的反演策略，它仅使用外部测量就能可靠地同时识别三个未知热物性参数。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，物理引导的Transformer架构为界面主导热系统中的正向和逆向建模提供了一个统一框架。

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Motivation: 迁移学习通过从相关源任务学习来优化目标任务性能。现有方法如自适应SVM在资源受限设备上参数过多、推理慢，需要更高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 提出自适应张量核机（Adapt-TKM），利用低秩张量网络在原始域学习紧凑非线性模型，通过正则化从源任务迁移知识到适应模型，不增加额外参数。

Result: 在耳后EEG癫痫检测中，使用少量患者特定数据个性化患者独立模型，患者适应模型性能优于患者独立和完全患者特定模型，参数比自适应SVM少100倍，推理速度相应更快。

Conclusion: Adapt-TKM是一种高效的迁移学习方法，特别适合资源受限的可穿戴设备，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数和提升推理速度。

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

Conclusion: SeeNav-Agent框架通过双视角视觉提示和SRGPO强化微调有效解决了VLN代理的感知、推理和规划问题，显著提升了导航性能，为视觉语言导航提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: F2D2框架通过联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，将基于流的生成模型的采样和似然评估所需的神经网络评估次数减少两个数量级，同时保持高样本质量和准确的对数似然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最好的生成模型（如扩散和基于流的模型）需要数百到数千次神经网络评估来计算单个似然值，这构成了计算瓶颈。虽然蒸馏方法可以加速采样，但往往以牺牲似然可计算性为代价。

Method: 提出快速流联合蒸馏（F2D2）框架，利用连续归一化流中采样和似然的耦合ODE共享底层速度场的特点，使用单个模型联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，仅需添加一个散度预测头。

Result: F2D2能够以少量步骤评估实现准确的对数似然，同时保持高样本质量。应用该方法，2步MeanFlow模型仅需额外一次反向NFE就能超越1024步教师模型。

Conclusion: F2D2解决了基于流生成模型中长期存在的计算瓶颈，实现了采样和似然评估的高效联合加速，为生成模型的实际应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

Motivation: 现有基于核的多视图学习方法大多使用融合技术而不强制视图间的显式协作类型，或使用协同正则化限制了全局协作，需要一种能促进互补学习并保持特征隔离的方法。

Method: 提出自适应加权LS-SVM（AW-LSSVM），通过迭代全局耦合机制，让每个视图专注于其他视图在前一轮迭代中的困难样本，实现互补学习。

Conclusion: AW-LSSVM通过自适应加权和迭代全局耦合有效促进了多视图互补学习，在提升性能的同时保持了特征隔离的优势。

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations. Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模生成模型的负责任部署和维护提供了可行路径，使行业能够以实用有效的方式满足持续的数据删除请求要求。

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测（CP）为黑盒机器学习模型提供统计上严谨的不确定性集，但需要提高其效率。共形校正通过共形感知的低效损失来微调或包装基础模型，但存在效率与模型预测熵之间的权衡

Method: 提出熵约束的共形校正方法，在探索效率与熵之间更好的帕累托最优。该方法通过约束熵来平衡共形预测的效率与模型预测的不确定性

Result: 在计算机视觉和图数据集上的广泛实验结果表明该方法有效，能将最先进CP方法的效率显著提高达34.4%（给定熵阈值条件下）

Conclusion: 熵约束的共形校正方法能够有效平衡共形预测效率与模型预测熵，在给定熵阈值条件下显著提升CP方法的效率

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.

Result: 该方法实现了与标准变分自编码器和Wasserstein自编码器相当的分布匹配效果，并且可以推广到其他潜在分布

Conclusion: 对抗性无线干扰为潜在空间分布匹配提供了一种新颖有效的正则化方法，具有可扩展性和通用性

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members. Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of our perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的输入归一化方法，发现REVIN是最有效的归一化方法，在零样本预测中相比未归一化基线将MASE降低了89%，相比其他归一化方法降低了44%，同时保持了最佳域内精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型中的输入归一化方法研究不足。时间序列数据具有显著的尺度变化和非平稳性，这些特性会损害TSFM的性能，无论模型架构多么复杂。与文本或图像不同，时间序列数据在不同领域和通道间存在显著尺度差异，需要专门研究归一化方法。

Method: 通过系统评估四种架构不同的时间序列基础模型，实证研究各种输入归一化方法。特别关注REVIN方法，并分析不同模型类型（概率模型、点预测模型、基于LLM的模型）和优化目标对归一化效果的影响。

Result: REVIN被证明是最有效的归一化方法：在零样本预测中将MASE相比未归一化基线降低89%，相比其他归一化方法降低44%。同时匹配最佳域内精度（0.84 MASE），无需任何数据集级预处理，实现了最高的精度-效率权衡。但归一化效果受架构设计选择和优化目标影响，特别是训练损失尺度敏感性和模型类型。

Conclusion: 输入归一化对时间序列基础模型的性能至关重要，REVIN是最有效的归一化方法。然而，归一化效果的利用取决于架构设计选择和优化目标，特别是在训练损失尺度敏感性和模型类型方面。这为TSFM的设计和优化提供了重要指导。

Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

Motivation: 文本丰富、动态的双边市场（如劳动力市场）中，内容和交互图不断演变，传统推荐方法难以有效处理这种复杂性和时效性

Method: 结合预训练语言模型和图神经网络，使用对抗性负采样和时间点子图训练，学习捕捉文本语义和图结构的联合表示

Conclusion: 融合语言和图表示是处理文本丰富、动态双边推荐的有效解决方案，弥合了预训练语言模型与大规模图在实际应用中的差距

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应去中心化联邦学习(aDFL)方法，通过自适应调整客户端学习率来减轻异常客户端对全局模型的负面影响，无需先验知识或对邻居节点的严格假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中，异常客户端（由噪声或中毒数据引起）会显著破坏学习过程并降低模型鲁棒性。现有方法通常需要足够多的正常邻居客户端或可靠客户端的先验知识，这降低了DFL的实际适用性。

Method: 开发自适应DFL(aDFL)方法，核心思想是自适应调整客户端的学习率：对可疑客户端分配较小学习率，对正常客户端分配较大学习率，以完全自适应方式减轻异常客户端对全局模型的负面影响。

Result: 理论分析不要求对邻居节点施加严格条件且无需先验知识，提供了严格的收敛分析以保证aDFL的oracle性质。大量数值实验证明了aDFL方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: aDFL方法通过自适应学习率调整有效解决了去中心化联邦学习中异常客户端的问题，提高了模型鲁棒性，具有更好的实用性和理论保证。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

Motivation: 优化、不确定性量化或推理等外部循环任务在底层高保真模型计算成本高昂时可能变得难以处理。数据驱动架构通常需要大量数据集才能以足够精度执行预测任务。多保真度模拟器通过利用可能带有偏差的低成本低保真度信息，同时使用稀缺但准确的高保真度数据进行校正和细化，为解决这些挑战提供了可能。

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

TL;DR: Fairy2i 是一个通用框架，可将预训练的实值LLM转换为等效的复值形式，实现极低比特量化（低至2比特），同时重用现有模型权重，显著超越现有实值量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的内存和计算需求巨大，需要激进量化（低至1比特）。复值模型（如iFairy）在低比特表示方面有优势，但需要从头训练，无法利用现有预训练实值模型生态系统。需要一种方法既能获得复值模型的量化优势，又能重用现有预训练模型。

Method: 1. 证明实值映射与广义线性复值映射之间的无损数学等价性；2. 将标准Transformer转换为复域；3. 采用相位感知量化方案，使用四阶单位根的高效码本；4. 引入递归残差量化机制，迭代最小化量化误差；5. 通过高效的无乘法累加进行推理。

Result: Fairy2i将LLaMA-2 7B模型恢复至有效2比特精度，性能接近全精度基线，显著优于最先进的实值二值和三值量化方法。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了复值算术表示效率与预训练模型实际实用性之间的差距，为在商用硬件上进行高效推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Thurstone模型的参数估计和不确定性量化，而本文旨在解决这类模型的最小最大假设检验这一基本问题。

Method: 引入了一般成对比较模型与Thurstone模型类之间的分离距离概念，基于此构建假设检验，使用反向鞅技术建立时间一致的I类和II类错误概率界，并采用信息论方法推导最小最大下界。

Result: 推导了依赖于观测图拓扑的检验临界阈值上下界，对于完全观测图，阈值缩放为Θ((nk)^{-1/2})，其中n为智能体数量，k为每对比较次数。通过合成和真实数据集验证了结果。

Conclusion: 建立了一个完整的广义Thurstone模型假设检验理论框架，提供了检验阈值、误差概率界和置信区间，为成对比较数据的模型选择提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: 多模态学习方法平均AUROC达到90.1%，比仅使用图结构的图神经网络模型提高了3.7%。因果分析显示：较高降水量使事故率上升24%，高速公路等高速道路使事故率上升22%，季节模式使事故率上升29%。消融研究证实卫星图像特征对准确预测至关重要。

Conclusion: 整合道路网络数据和卫星图像的多模态方法能显著提高交通事故预测准确性，卫星图像特征是不可或缺的预测要素，因果分析揭示了关键影响因素，为交通安全管理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PruningAMR算法通过修剪INR权重矩阵识别几何特征，生成自适应分辨率网格，实现内存高效的可视化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然隐式神经表示(INR)比传统格点数据更内存高效，但许多可视化任务仍需要离散化到规则网格。现有方法无法自动生成适应INR底层分辨率的自适应网格。

Method: 提出PruningAMR算法：1) 对INR权重矩阵使用插值分解修剪方法识别几何特征；2) 利用修剪后的网络指导自适应网格细化；3) 从预训练INR（无需访问训练数据）生成变分辨率可视化

Result: 算法能够自动生成适应函数底层分辨率的网格，实现显著的内存节省，特别适用于4D CT扫描等内存密集型可视化任务

Conclusion: PruningAMR通过INR权重修剪实现自适应网格生成，为隐式神经表示的可视化提供了内存高效且自动化的解决方案

Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

TL;DR: ProteinPNet是一个基于原型部分网络的新框架，用于从空间蛋白质组学数据中发现肿瘤微环境（TME）模式，通过监督训练直接学习可解释的空间原型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解肿瘤微环境（TME）的空间结构对推进精准肿瘤学至关重要。传统的事后解释模型存在局限性，需要能够直接学习可解释空间原型的框架。

Method: 基于原型部分网络（prototypical part networks）的ProteinPNet框架，通过监督训练直接学习具有判别性、可解释性和忠实性的空间原型。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了方法的有效性，在真实世界肺癌空间蛋白质组学数据中，ProteinPNet一致地识别出与不同肿瘤亚型对齐的生物学意义原型，这些原型捕捉了免疫浸润和组织模块化的差异特征。

Conclusion: 基于原型的学习方法有潜力揭示TME中可解释的空间生物标志物，对空间组学的机制发现具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

*Hamid Dadkhahi,Firas Trabelsi,Parker Riley,Juraj Juraska,Mehdi Mirzazadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布校准的聚合方法，通过建模三向偏好，利用极性（非平局边际）和决定性（非平局率）来提升LLM作为评估者的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM作为成对偏好评估者在单样本级别存在噪声，常见的聚合规则（多数投票、软自一致性或基于指令的自聚合）在允许平局时存在不一致性

Method: 提出基于推理时计算（ITC）的分布校准聚合方案，使用Bradley-Terry-Davidson公式对评分计数建模三向偏好，同时利用极性和决定性来区分窄边际与强共识

Result: 在各种评估基准上，该方法持续减少MAE并提高成对准确率，与人类共识元标签相比，匹配或超过个体人类评分者

Conclusion: 精心分配推理时计算并使用分布感知方法聚合，可以将噪声的个体模型判断转化为可靠的评估评分

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) used as judges for pairwise preferences remain noisy at the single-sample level, and common aggregation rules (majority vote, soft self-consistency, or instruction-based self-aggregation) are inconsistent when ties are allowed. We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation.

TL;DR: TokenPowerBench是首个专注于LLM推理功耗研究的轻量级可扩展基准测试工具，支持GPU、节点和系统级功耗测量，无需专用功率计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM服务每天处理数十亿查询，推理占90%以上总功耗，但现有基准测试主要关注训练/微调或推理性能，缺乏对推理功耗的测量和分析支持。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：(1)声明式配置接口，覆盖模型选择、提示集和推理引擎；(2)无需专用功率计的测量层，捕获GPU、节点和系统级功耗；(3)阶段对齐的指标管道，将能耗归因于每个请求的预填充和解码阶段。

Result: 在四个最广泛使用的模型系列（Llama、Falcon、Qwen、Mistral）上评估，参数规模从10亿到前沿的Llama3-405B模型，支持用户快速评估不同设置对每令牌能耗的影响。

Conclusion: TokenPowerBench作为开源工具发布，帮助用户测量功耗、预测运营成本，并在部署LLM服务时实现可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.

### [151] [Opening the Black Box: Nowcasting Singapore's GDP Growth and its Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02092)
*Luca Attolico*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发新加坡GDP实时预测框架，使用约70个指标，涵盖多种机器学习方法，相比基准模型降低RMSFE约40-60%，特征重要性显示工业生产、对外贸易和劳动力市场指标是关键驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新加坡作为小型开放经济体，外部冲击会迅速传导至国内经济活动，因此需要及时评估当前经济状况。实时预测对于政策制定和经济监测至关重要。

Method: 使用高维面板数据（约70个指标），涵盖惩罚回归、降维方法、集成学习算法和神经网络架构。采用扩展窗口前向设计保持时间顺序，使用贝叶斯超参数优化和移动块自助法构建预测区间。通过模型置信集程序识别统计上优越的学习器，并使用简单、加权和指数加权方案进行组合。

Result: 惩罚回归、降维模型和GRU网络在所有基准模型上表现一致优越，RMSFE降低约40-60%。模型聚合带来进一步改进。特征归因方法显示工业生产、对外贸易和劳动力市场指标是新加坡短期增长动态的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 开发的新加坡GDP实时预测框架在预测准确性方面显著优于传统基准模型，为政策制定者提供了有效的实时经济监测工具，同时通过可解释性工具揭示了经济增长的关键驱动因素。

Abstract: Timely assessment of current conditions is essential especially for small, open economies such as Singapore, where external shocks transmit rapidly to domestic activity. We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.

*Lucas Resende,Guillaume Lecué,Lionel Wilner,Philippe Choné*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出一种新的无偏估计方法解决多向引力模型中PPML的伴随参数问题，通过重构为分类任务，在稀疏数据中计算更快且估计更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大似然估计器（如PPML）存在伴随参数问题：在联合估计结构参数和伴随参数时会产生偏差。特别是在多向引力模型和网络形成文献常见的稀疏数据环境中，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 将估计问题重构为一系列分类任务，该方法对固定效应的数量和结构具有不可知性。在稀疏数据环境中计算速度比PPML更快。

Result: 新估计器比PPML及其偏差校正策略产生更准确的点估计和置信区间。即使在模型设定错误的情况下，改进仍然存在，且在稀疏设置中更为明显。PPML仅在密集、低维数据中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多向模型提供了一个稳健的替代方案，能有效随稀疏性扩展。已应用于估计法国医疗保健空间可达性的政策改革效果。

Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators, such as the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML), suffer from the incidental parameter problem: a bias in the estimation of structural parameters that arises from the joint estimation of structural and nuisance parameters. To address this issue in multi-way gravity models, we propose a novel, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our method reframes the estimation as a series of classification tasks and is agnostic to both the number and structure of fixed effects. In sparse data environments, common in the network formation literature, it is also computationally faster than PPML. We provide empirical evidence that our estimator yields more accurate point estimates and confidence intervals than PPML and its bias-correction strategies. These improvements hold even under model misspecification and are more pronounced in sparse settings. While PPML remains competitive in dense, low-dimensional data, our approach offers a robust alternative for multi-way models that scales efficiently with sparsity. The method is applied to estimate the effect of a policy reform on spatial accessibility to health care in France.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多维连续测量误差模型的新识别方法，无需测量值具有单射性，通过三阶交叉矩和张量分解识别潜在因子分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测量误差模型通常要求至少有一个测量值能单射地映射潜在分布，这在实证研究中往往不现实。论文旨在放宽这一限制，在更广泛的测量误差相关性和非单射测量条件下实现识别。

Method: 利用三阶交叉矩构造三阶张量，通过Kruskal定理保证的唯一张量分解识别因子载荷矩阵。在线性结构下，通过构造合适测量值并应用Kotlarski恒等式恢复潜在因子全分布。还提出了广义Kruskal秩（信号秩）用于非线性模型识别。

Result: 证明了在测量误差相关且无单射测量的情况下，仍能完全识别潜在向量和测量误差的联合分布。提供了单射条件下的用户友好可检验识别条件，并建立了非线性模型的通用识别结果。

Conclusion: 多维潜在结构可在比先前认为更广泛的设定下恢复，这对因子模型、调查数据报告误差、计量经济学中的测量误差回归变量、心理学和市场营销中的多维潜在特质模型等具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: This paper develops new identification results for multidimensional continuous measurement-error models where all observed measurements are contaminated by potentially correlated errors and none provides an injective mapping of the latent distribution. Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于企业规模和部门投入产出流重建大规模加权企业间网络的算法，包含四步：概率矩阵生成、伯努利抽样构建无权重图、图连通性调整、二次规划加权，可重建500万企业1亿连接的美国生产网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要从公开可得的有限数据（企业规模、部门投入产出流）重建大规模、细粒度的企业间网络，以研究生产网络结构及其经济影响。

Method: 四步算法：1) 基于增强重力模型（考虑企业规模和部门间流量）生成连接概率矩阵；2) 伯努利抽样构建有向无权图；3) 添加自环和跨强连通分量连接确保图非周期且不可约；4) 通过凸二次规划最小化权重欧几里得范数，在保持企业规模和部门流量的约束下分配权重。

Result: 成功重建了包含500多万企业和1亿多买卖关系的美国生产网络，重建网络展现出与真实网络样本一致的拓扑特性：度分布厚尾、适度聚类、接近零的互惠性，算法复杂度最坏O(N²)但可通过部门分箱近似为O(N)。

Conclusion: 该算法能够从公开数据有效重建大规模细粒度生产网络，为研究生产网络结构提供了实用工具，并开源代码促进相关研究。

Abstract: This paper develops an algorithm to reconstruct large weighted firm-to-firm networks using information about the size of the firms and sectoral input-output flows. Our algorithm is based on a four-step procedure. We first generate a matrix of probabilities of connections between all firms in the economy using an augmented gravity model embedded in a logistic function that takes firm size as mass. The model is parameterized to allow for the probability of a link between two firms to depend not only on their sizes but also on flows across the sectors to which they belong. We then use a Bernoulli draw to construct a directed but unweighted random graph from the probability distribution generated by the logistic-gravity function. We make the graph aperiodic by adding self-loops and irreducible by adding links between Strongly Connected Components while limiting distortions to sectoral flows. We convert the unweighted network to a weighted network by solving a convex quadratic programming problem that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the weights. The solution preserves the observed firm sizes and sectoral flows within reasonable bounds, while limiting the strength of the self-loops. Computationally, the algorithm is O(N2) in the worst case, but it can be evaluated in O(N) via sector-wise binning of firm sizes, albeit with an approximation error. We implement the algorithm to reconstruct the full US production network with more than 5 million firms and 100 million buyer-seller connections. The reconstructed network exhibits topological properties consistent with small samples of the real US buyer-seller networks, including fat-tails in degree distribution, mild clustering, and near-zero reciprocity. We provide open-source code of the algorithm to enable researchers to reconstruct large-scale granular production networks from publicly available data.

*Walter W. Zhang*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个框架，帮助企业在遵守"解释权"法规（如GDPR）的同时优化营销策略，通过构建可理解的定向策略并量化解释成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习和大数据的发展，企业能够完全个性化营销策略，但欧盟GDPR等数据隐私法规要求企业提供"解释权"，即营销策略必须对客户可理解。企业需要在遵守法规和最大化利润之间找到平衡。

Method: 首先构建由句子表示的可理解定向策略类别；其次展示如何优化这类策略以找到利润最大化的可理解策略；证明直接从数据估计可理解策略比将黑盒策略投影为可理解策略更优；最后比较最优黑盒策略和最优可理解策略。

Result: 使用耐用消费品零售商的价格促销现场实验数据进行实证应用，量化解释成本（定义为最优黑盒策略与可理解策略之间的预期利润差异）。与黑盒基准相比，可理解定向策略使利润减少7.5%或每位客户23美分。

Conclusion: 企业可以通过直接优化可理解策略来遵守解释权法规，虽然这会带来一定的利润损失（解释成本），但提供了合规的解决方案。框架为企业导航解释权立法提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Developments in machine learning and big data allow firms to fully personalize and target their marketing mix. However, data and privacy regulations, such as those in the European Union (GDPR), incorporate a "right to explanation," which is fulfilled when targeting policies are comprehensible to customers. This paper provides a framework for firms to navigate right-to-explanation legislation. First, I construct a class of comprehensible targeting policies that is represented by a sentence. Second, I show how to optimize over this class of policies to find the profit-maximizing comprehensible policy. I further demonstrate that it is optimal to estimate the comprehensible policy directly from the data, rather than projecting down the black box policy into a comprehensible policy. Third, I find the optimal black box targeting policy and compare it to the optimal comprehensible policy. I then empirically apply my framework using data from a price promotion field experiment from a durable goods retailer. I quantify the cost of explanation, which I define as the difference in expected profits between the optimal black box and comprehensible targeting policies. Compared to the black box benchmark, the comprehensible targeting policy reduces profits by 7.5% or 23 cents per customer.

### [156] [How IFRS Affects Value Relevance and Key Financial Indicators? Evidence from the UK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02480)
*Yhlas Sovbetov*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究通过TEST-A和TEST-B分析，探讨IFRS采纳对英国公司价值相关性和财务指标的影响。TEST-A发现IFRS对价值相关性有积极影响，TEST-B显示IFRS对盈利能力和杠杆比率有显著影响，但对效率-流动性比率无影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是填补IFRS采纳文献中的两个空白：1) 深入分析IFRS采纳对英国公司价值相关性的影响；2) 系统考察IFRS采纳对公司关键财务指标的影响。通过实证检验IFRS采纳的实际效果，为会计准则变革提供证据支持。

Method: 采用两种分析方法：TEST-A使用Ohlson(1995)模型检验IFRS对价值相关性的影响，由于数据不符合正态分布，采用非参数检验；TEST-B分析IFRS对财务指标的影响，包括盈利能力比率(ROE、ROCE、ROA、PM)、杠杆比率(GR)和效率-流动性比率，使用前向逐步回归分析。

Result: TEST-A拒绝了H01假设，发现IFRS对价值相关性有积极影响，Ohlson模型中虚拟变量(MODE)系数为正。TEST-B拒绝了H02假设，显示IFRS采纳显著影响所有盈利能力比率和杠杆比率，但不影响效率-流动性比率。前向逐步回归分析中，只有ROCE、ROA和PM比率显示出显著的正向影响。

Conclusion: IFRS采纳对英国公司的价值相关性有积极影响，同时显著改变了公司的盈利能力和杠杆比率，但对效率-流动性比率没有影响。这表明IFRS采纳确实改变了财务报告的质量和财务指标的计算方式，为会计准则改革提供了实证支持。

Abstract: This paper has two contributions to the International Financial Reporting Stands (IFRS) adoption literature. First is the scrutinizing impact of IFRS adoption on value relevance in the UK with TEST-A analysis under the H01 hypothesis. The second contribution is capturing the impact of IFRS adoption on key financial indicators of firms with the TEST-B analysis that hypothesizes H02.The statistical differences of items of two different reporting standards are examined with non-parametric tests as all input variables failed the Shapiro-Wilk and Lilliefors normality tests in TEST-A. The finding rejects the H01 hypothesis for BvMv, and agrees that IFRS has impact on value relevance. Besides, Ohlson's (1995) model documents that the coefficient of dummy variable (MODE) is positive. Therefore, the analysis concludes that IFRS has positive impact on value relevance. The aftermath of TEST-B rejects the H02 hypothesis for all profitability ratios (ROE, ROCE, ROA, PM) and gearing ratios (GR). It concludes that profitability and gearing ratios are affected by IFRS adoption, whereas efficiency-liquidity ratios are not. Also, in Forward Stepwise regression analysis only ROCE, ROA, and PM ratios show significant results. The analysis documents positive and significant impact of IFRS on these three ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究品牌动态（品牌信任和品牌价值）如何影响土耳其保险市场的保费产出，以了解品牌因素在保险销售中的作用。

Method: 使用动态GMM面板估计技术，对2005-2015年间31家土耳其保险公司进行抽样分析。

Result: 品牌信任是保费产出的主要驱动力（每单位增加带来532万土耳其里拉增长）；品牌价值有统计显著性但影响有限（每百万里拉增长仅带来0.02万里拉销售增长）；存在显著的过去年度保费产出动量效应（1:0.85的权衡）。

Conclusion: 品牌信任比品牌价值对保险保费产出影响更大；土耳其保险市场存在较高的客户忠诚度和从众效应；保险公司应优先投资于建立品牌信任而非单纯提升品牌价值。

Abstract: This paper examines influences of brand dynamics on insurance premium productions in Turkey using a dynamic GMM panel estimation technique sampling 31 insurance firms over 2005-2015. The results reveals that brands trust appears as a chief driving force behind premium production where its unit increase augments premium outputs by 5.32 million Turkish Liras (TL). Moreover, the brand value of firms also appears a statistically significant determinant of premium sales, but its size impact remains limited comparing to brand trust, i.e. a million TL increase in brand value generates only 0.02 million TL increase in sales. On the other hand, the study also documents a strong momentum driven from past years premium production with trade-off magnitude of 1 to 0.85. This might imply a higher loyalty-stickiness of customers in Turkey, as well as a self-feeding "bandwagon effect".

TL;DR: AI adoption数据能提升企业财务困境预测模型的准确性，特别是在识别困境企业方面效果显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究企业层面的人工智能采用是否能在传统财务比率之外，改善企业财务困境的样本外预测能力

Method: 使用中国上市公司数据（2008-2023年），针对稀疏的AI数据采用新颖的修剪训练窗口方法，测试多种机器学习模型

Result: AI采用能持续提高预测准确性，在识别困境企业的召回率方面提升最大；基于树的模型和AI密度指标最有效；使用更长历史数据的模型优于仅依赖近期"AI丰富"数据的模型

Conclusion: 研究结果为早期预警信号提供了框架，并展示了AI指标作为与传统会计指标不同的稳定、补充性风险指标的广泛潜力

Abstract: This study investigates whether firm-level artificial intelligence (AI) adoption improves the out-of-sample prediction of corporate financial distress models beyond traditional financial ratios. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms (2008-2023), we address sparse AI data with a novel pruned training window method, testing multiple machine learning models. We find that AI adoption consistently increases predictive accuracy, with the largest gains in recall rates for identifying distressed firms. Tree-based models and AI density metrics proved most effective. Crucially, models using longer histories outperformed those relying solely on recent "AI-rich" data. The analysis also identifies divergent adoption patterns, with healthy firms exhibiting earlier and higher AI uptake than distressed peers. These findings, while based on Chinese data, provide a framework for early-warning signals and demonstrate the broader potential of AI metrics as a stable, complementary risk indicator distinct from traditional accounting measures.

### [159] [Retail Price Ripples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02564)
*Xiao Ling,Sourav Ray,Daniel Levy*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究发现零售价格存在"小幅不对称定价"现象：小幅涨价多于小幅降价，但大幅价格变动中无此不对称性，且存在相反现象（小幅降价多于涨价）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对小幅度价格变动关注不足，且存在数据局限（单一零售商、有限产品、短期数据、老旧数据），无法确定这些现象是否真实存在还是数据聚合导致的测量误差，也无法评估其当前实践相关性。

Method: 分析大规模数据集（2006-2015年，近790亿周度价格观测值，覆盖527种产品、约35,000家门店、161家零售商），进行系列分析验证测量误差问题。

Result: 发现稳健的"小幅不对称定价"证据：小幅涨价数量超过小幅降价，但大幅价格变动中无此不对称性；同时发现相反现象（小幅降价多于涨价）。结果对多种测量问题具有稳健性。

Conclusion: 不对称定价实践比现有文献认识到的更具当前相关性和普遍性，零售商可能利用消费者对小幅度价格变动不敏感的特点来增加利润，同时避免触发消费者公平性担忧。

Abstract: Much like small ripples in a stream, which get lost in the larger waves, small changes in retail prices often fly under the radar of public perceptions, while large price changes appear as marketing moves associated with demand and competition. Unnoticed, these could increase consumers out of pocket expenses. Indeed, retailers could boost their profits by making numerous small price increases or by obfuscating large price increases with numerous small price decreases, thereby bypassing the consumers full attention and consideration, and triggering consumer fairness concerns. Yet only a handful of papers study small price changes. Extant results are often based on a single retailer, limited products, short time span, and legacy datasets dating back to the 1980s and 1990s, leaving their current practical relevance questionable. Researchers have also questioned whether the reported observations of small price changes are artifacts of measurement errors driven by data aggregation. In a series of analyses of a large dataset containing almost 79 billion weekly price observations from 2006 to 2015, covering 527 products, and about 35,000 stores across 161 retailers, we find robust evidence of asymmetric pricing in the small, where small price increases outnumber small price decreases, but no such asymmetry is present in the large. We also document the reverse phenomenon, where small price decreases outnumber small price increases. Our results are robust to several possible measurement issues. Importantly, our findings indicate a greater current relevance and generalizability of such asymmetric pricing practices than the existing literature recognizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析土耳其经济增长对生态系统的影响，探讨经济发展与环境可持续性之间的关系，为制定平衡经济增长与环境保护的政策提供依据。

Method: 使用1995-2021年年度数据，采用ARDL方法，构建七个模型分析经济增长对生态系统不同维度的影响，以生态系统活力指数（EPI子维度）为主要指标。

Result: 经济增长对所有模型均有显著影响，但方向不同：GDP增长1%使农业和水资源指数增加0.074-0.672%，但使生物多样性、生态系统服务、渔业、酸雨和总生态系统活力指数减少0.101-2.144%。

Conclusion: 经济增长过程需要考虑环境成本，应将环保政策与可持续发展战略相结合，以减少经济增长的负面影响，实现经济与环境的协调发展。

Abstract: This study analyzes the impacts of economic growth on ecosystem in Türkiye. The study uses annual data for the period 1995-2021 and the ARDL method. The study utilizes the Ecosystem Vitality Index, a sub-dimension of the Environmental Performance Index. In addition, seven models were constructed to assess in detail the impact of economic growth on different dimensions of the ecosystem. The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP reduces the indices of biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality by 0.101-2.144%. The results suggest that the environmental costs of economic growth processes need to be considered. Environmentally friendly policies should be combined with sustainable development strategies to reduce the negative impacts of economic growth.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究构建了土耳其81个省份的社会经济发展指数，使用16个经济和社会指标，通过主成分分析和K-Means聚类分析，发现土耳其各省份存在显著的区域发展差异，西部省份发展水平较高，东部和东南部省份面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土耳其作为一个地理、文化和经济多元化的国家，各省份之间的社会经济差异对国家发展水平有重要影响。确定各省份的社会经济状况和区域差异是规划和实施有效政策的重要步骤。

Method: 研究使用16个经济和社会指标构建社会经济发展指数，采用Min-Max归一化方法和主成分分析将指标转换为指数，然后使用K-Means聚类算法和肘部方法将省份分组，最后通过散点图、聚类地图和QGIS工具进行可视化呈现。

Result: 研究结果显示：土耳其81个省份中，2个省份（伊斯坦布尔和安卡拉）具有非常高的社会经济指数，30个省份为高指数，25个中等，24个低指数。总体上，土耳其西部省份社会经济指数较高，而东部和东南部安纳托利亚地区省份在社会经济指标方面面临严重挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究成功识别了土耳其各省份的社会经济发展差异，为政策制定者提供了重要的区域发展不平衡信息，有助于制定针对性的区域发展政策，特别是需要关注东部和东南部欠发达地区的挑战。

Abstract: Regional disparities in the economic and social structures of countries have a great impact on their development levels. In geographically, culturally and economically diverse countries like Turkiye, determining the socioeconomic status of the provinces and regional differences is an important step for planning and implementing effective policies. Therefore, this study aims to determine the socioeconomic disparities of the provinces in Turkiye. For this purpose, a socioeconomic development index covering the economic and social dimensions of 81 provinces was constructed. For the index, 16 different indicators representing economic and social factors were used. These indicators were converted into indices using the Min-Max normalization method and Principal Component Analysis. Afterwards, using these indices, the provinces were divided into groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm and the Elbow method. In the last part of the study, the results are presented in a visual format using Scatter Plots, clustering maps and QGIS mapping tools. The results of the study show that 2 of the 81 provinces in Turkiye have very high, 30 high, 25 medium and 24 low socioeconomic indices. Istanbul and Ankara have very high socioeconomic status. In general, the provinces in western Turkiye have a high socioeconomic index, while the provinces in eastern and southeastern Anatolia face serious challenges in terms of socioeconomic indicators.

### [162] [Localizing Preference Aggregation Conflicts: A Graph-Theoretic Approach Using Sheaves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02416)
*Karen Sargsyan*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 基于离散层论的图论框架，用于诊断和定位偏好聚合中的不一致性，通过障碍轨迹识别具体投票者交互冲突，提出不兼容性指数量化局部冲突，并开发多项式时间约束DAG算法实现投票者合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性化方法（如HodgeRank）无法保留序数偏好的离散结构，且不能识别导致聚合失败的具体投票者交互。需要一种能提供局部冲突信息的方法来诊断偏好聚合中的不一致性。

Method: 引入基于离散层论的图论框架，通过障碍轨迹识别具体投票者交互冲突，形式化不兼容性指数量化局部冲突，使用Mallows模型分析随机变化下的行为，开发层论前推操作建模投票者合并，实现多项式时间约束DAG算法。

Result: 该框架能够保留序数偏好的离散结构，识别导致聚合失败的具体投票者交互，量化局部冲突，并通过图商将分布式边冲突转化为局部不可能性（空茎），提供聚合悖论跨尺度持续性的拓扑特征。

Conclusion: 离散层论框架为偏好聚合不一致性提供了更精细的诊断和定位工具，能够识别传统全局方法无法提供的局部冲突信息，并通过拓扑方法揭示了聚合悖论在不同尺度下的持续性特征。

Abstract: We introduce a graph-theoretic framework based on discrete sheaves to diagnose and localize inconsistencies in preference aggregation. Unlike traditional linearization methods (e.g., HodgeRank), this approach preserves the discrete structure of ordinal preferences, identifying which specific voter interactions cause aggregation failure -- information that global methods cannot provide -- via the Obstruction Locus. We formalize the Incompatibility Index to quantify these local conflicts and examine their behavior under stochastic variations using the Mallows model. Additionally, we develop a rigorous sheaf-theoretic pushforward operation to model voter merging, implemented via a polynomial-time constraint DAG algorithm. We demonstrate that graph quotients transform distributed edge conflicts into local impossibilities (empty stalks), providing a topological characterization of how aggregation paradoxes persist across scales.

### [163] [Convergence to stationary points in the Weisbuch-Kirman-Herreiner model for buyers' preferences in fish markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02883)
*Ali Ellouze,Bastien Fernandez*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文对Weisbuch等人提出的OTC鱼市买家偏好模型进行数学分析，证明在买家同质化情况下，几乎所有初始条件都会收敛到稳态，并确定了稳态及其稳定性条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weisbuch等人2000年提出的OTC鱼市买家偏好模型已成为结合有限理性和近视推理的经济概念原型，但关于其渐近行为的文献仍然稀缺。本文旨在对该模型的动力学进行数学分析。

Method: 使用合作动力系统理论，在买家同质化的最简单情况下对模型进行数学分析。通过理论证明和参数分析来确定所有稳态及其稳定性。

Result: 证明无论卖家数量和参数如何，几乎所有初始条件的后续轨迹都必须渐近接近稳态。对于足够简单的卖家吸引力分布，确定了所有稳态及其参数依赖的稳定性。

Conclusion: 在大多数情况下，渐近偏好按吸引力排序。但根据参数不同，也存在稳健的运行模式，其中偏好最高的卖家并非提供最高利润的卖家。

Abstract: In a paper published in The Economic Journal in 2000, Weisbuch et al.\ introduce a model for buyers' preferences to the various sellers in over-the-counter (OTC) fish markets. While this model has become an archetype of economic conceptualization that combines bounded rationality and myopic reasoning, the literature on its asymptotic behaviours has remained scarce. In this paper, we proceed to a mathematical analysis of the dynamics and its full characterization in the simplest case of homogeneous buyer populations. By using elements of the theory of cooperative dynamical systems, we prove that, independently of the number of sellers and parameters, for almost every initial condition, the subsequent trajectory must asymptotically approach a stationary state. Moreover, for simple enough distributions of the sellers' attractiveness, we determine all stationary states and their parameter-dependent stability. This analysis shows that in most cases, the asymptotic preferences are ordered as the attractiveness are. However, depending on the parameters, there also exist robust functioning modes in which those sellers with highest preference are not the ones that provide highest profit.
