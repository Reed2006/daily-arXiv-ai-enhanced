### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平，在YouTube科学频道评论上取得了0.836的宏F1分数，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析非正式数字学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的教育话语分析和认知参与评估。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化来解决类别不平衡问题并增强泛化能力，构建了可复现的端到端处理流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC实现了0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于经典和transformer基线模型(p<0.01)，对高阶认知参与(特别是Explore和Negotiate类别)表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估提供了可扩展的理论指导方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的质量，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，提示框架结构主要影响事实准确性和教学完整性，RACE框架表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，为教育工作者提供选择模型和提示框架的指导。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐度和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的课程计划，Claude语言最复杂；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐度；所有学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，教学可靠性和课程对齐度更依赖提示框架，最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE框架及明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动精炼而非被动去噪来解决训练-推理差异导致的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散扩散模型存在训练-推理差异，导致并行解码时初始令牌错误会污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，造成语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 提出两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误建立基础修订能力，然后通过在线自校正循环训练模型修正自己的错误草稿，学习专家修正。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动精炼框架有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sparse Tracing技术，使用动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式。Stream算法在近线性时间和线性空间内估计稀疏注意力掩码，实现大规模单次可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统机制可解释性技术因注意力复杂度呈二次方增长，在超过10万token时需要TB级内存，无法有效分析长上下文。

Method: 提出Stream算法，通过可编译的分层剪枝方法，以二进制搜索式细化保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。

Result: 在长链式思维推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，揭示从针到输出的层间路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，无需TB级缓存，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化链式思维监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型分析电子健康记录中非结构化文本数据，以确定患者是否适合进行HIV进一步检测的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注结构化数据，但忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。大规模实验室检测不可行，而电子健康记录的普及为解决这一挑战提供了新机会。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的流程，利用大语言模型分析电子健康记录中的非结构化文本数据，评估患者进行HIV进一步检测的资格。

Result: 在鹿特丹伊拉斯谟大学医学中心的临床数据上进行的实验表明，该流程实现了高准确率，同时保持了低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用电子健康记录中的非结构化文本数据，为HIV筛查和早期诊断提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次对大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现进行了专家基准测试，评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现。专家评审显示37%的回复包含不准确或误导性信息，幻觉率高达40%，但解释质量和格式遵循度表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLM在生命周期评估中应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性证据。该研究旨在填补标准化评估框架的空白，为LLM在LCA领域的应用提供基准。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM（商业和开源模型）在22个LCA相关任务上的表现。17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准对模型输出进行评审，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 37%的回复包含不准确或误导信息；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型产生幻觉引用的比例高达40%；准确性和解释质量评分普遍中等或良好；格式遵循度普遍较好；开源模型在准确性和解释质量方面表现与闭源模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险（如将其视为自由形式的神谕），同时也展示了其在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的优势。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于游戏的多模态大语言模型评估方法，通过Dixit卡牌游戏来全面评估模型能力，避免传统基准测试的主观性和模型利用表面捷径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型评估存在静态基准测试无法综合评估、人工或模型比较主观且昂贵、模型可能利用表面捷径（如冗长回答）提高胜率等问题。

Method: 采用游戏化评估方法，具体使用Dixit幻想卡牌游戏，要求玩家为卡牌生成既能欺骗部分玩家又不会欺骗所有玩家的描述。

Result: 五个多模态大语言模型的Dixit胜率排名与流行基准测试排名完全一致，同时游戏揭示了人类与模型策略的差异以及模型推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 游戏化评估为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面、客观和有趣的评估框架，能够有效解决传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了DeepSeek-R1大语言模型在运筹学优化建模中的应用潜力，通过系统测试四个关键基准并开发幻觉缓解策略来提高模型在供应链等实际场景中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法严重依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为可求解的数学模型，而现有LLM模型存在高成本和幻觉问题。DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高且性能优异的模型，在运筹学应用场景中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 在四个关键运筹学基准（NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP、ComplexOR）上系统评估DeepSeek-R1，包括基线评估、开发幻觉分类法，并应用LLM-as-a-Judge、少样本学习、工具调用和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: 研究展示了DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的潜力，通过缓解策略减少了幻觉，提高了公式化准确性，并更好地对齐了模型输出与用户意图。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1为运筹学中的优化建模提供了一个可行的替代方案，特别是在成本敏感的实际应用中，通过适当的缓解策略可以有效提升其在供应链等场景中的适用性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和提炼任务级指导，无需参数更新即可从标记示例中学习分类函数，相比仅依赖标签的检索方法准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要一种更高效、可解释的LLM学习方法。

Method: 使用情景记忆存储实例级批评，语义记忆提炼可重用的任务级指导，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评进行学习。

Result: 在多样化任务中，加入批评比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思式学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

### [10] [LyriCAR: A Difficulty-Aware Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework For Controllable Lyric Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19967)
*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个用于可控歌词翻译的无监督框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时减少40%训练步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐-语言模式，在段落级别缺乏跨行连贯性和全局押韵能力。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式引导模型处理逐渐复杂的挑战。

Result: 在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务中，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均达到最先进结果，自适应课程策略减少近40%训练步骤。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效提升了歌词翻译质量，证明了无监督方法在复杂翻译任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合方法，将LLM的广泛语言处理能力与符号NLU的结构化关系表示能力相结合，以解决LLM的幻觉问题和符号系统的覆盖范围限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM依赖概率推理容易产生事实幻觉和输出结构不一致，而符号NLU系统虽然提供可解释的理解但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为填补知识空白的来源；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量及因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号管道。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，在特定任务上取得了比纯符号方法更好的效果。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于依赖树解析自然语言句子的基础算法，该算法逐个单词处理，能够立即将每个单词附加到依赖树中，模拟人脑的解析过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种更接近人脑处理语言方式的解析算法，不同于短语结构解析，该算法能够实时处理单词并构建依赖关系。

Method: 采用逐个单词处理的依赖解析方法，每个单词在可附加时立即附加到依赖树中，算法的最坏情况复杂度为O(n^3)。

Result: 该算法能够有效地将自然语言句子解析为依赖树，并且在人类语言中，最坏情况仅出现在小规模输入时。

Conclusion: 提出的依赖解析算法提供了一种更接近人类语言处理机制的方法，具有理论上的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式来评估临床决策任务，将任务分为临床背景和临床问题两个维度，随着背景和问题接近真实临床环境，难度增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA依赖简化的问答形式，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程。

Method: 提出了一个二维评估范式（临床背景和临床问题），总结了现有数据集设置，回顾了训练时和测试时的技术方法，并扩展了评估维度。

Result: 该范式能够澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的LLMs。

Conclusion: 提出的统一范式有助于更准确地评估LLMs在临床决策中的表现，推动开发真正有临床价值的语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

*Alexandra Apostolopoulou,Konstantinos Kanaris,Athanasios Koursaris,Dimitris Tsakalidis,George Domalis,Ioannis E. Livieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出希腊嵌入模型(GEM)系列，通过精心构建的大规模希腊语语料库和现代架构(如ELECTRA、ConvBERT等)，解决了希腊语NLP研究中架构单一、上下文长度受限的问题，特别是在法律领域取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决希腊语等形态丰富、中等资源语言NLP研究面临的挑战：研究碎片化、架构多样性不足、上下文长度受限(特别是法律领域512词符窗口不足)，以及缺乏专门针对法律领域的双语模型。

Method: 1) 构建大规模希腊语语料库，采用严格的质量驱动过滤和预处理方法；2) 在精心筛选的数据基础上预训练多种现代架构(ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT等)；3) 提出首个面向法律领域的希腊-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 在下游任务上的广泛实验表明，新模型类别验证了所提方法的有效性，特别是GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过质量驱动的数据构建和现代架构的多样化应用，成功提升了希腊语NLP性能，特别是在法律文档处理方面，为中等资源语言的NLP研究提供了有效范例。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

### [15] [Improving Transfer Learning for Sequence Labeling Tasks by Adapting Pre-trained Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20033)
*David Dukić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该博士论文通过改进预训练神经语言模型的迁移学习方法，提升了序列标注任务的性能，提出了三种改进策略：多任务模型、架构修改和生成式上下文微调框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果有待提升，特别是在领域迁移、信息流方向和生成式应用方面存在改进空间。

Method: 1) 多任务模型：引入领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2) 架构修改：在自回归大语言模型中实现跨层双向信息流；3) 生成式监督上下文微调框架：结合响应导向的适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的性能可以通过多任务学习、架构改进和生成式上下文微调等针对性迁移学习方法得到显著提升。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolScope通过自动合并冗余工具和智能检索相关工具，解决了LLM代理在工具使用中面临的工具冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升了工具选择准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集常包含名称和描述重叠的冗余工具，导致选择模糊性，同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集。

Method: ToolScope包含两个组件：ToolScopeMerger（带自动校正功能）自动审计和修复工具合并以减少冗余；ToolScopeRetriever对每个查询进行工具排序和选择，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制。

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升了8.38%到38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope通过减少工具冗余和优化工具选择，有效增强了LLM的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言基准测试在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集来填补这一空白。

Method: 创建了包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和地区方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并评估了多个多语言语言模型在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别上表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著较差；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都大幅提升。

Conclusion: 需要上下文感知架构和经过文化策划的训练数据来提升语言模型在低资源文化背景下的表现。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: 使用RLAIF和DPO方法增强波斯语小语言模型的医学推理能力，通过翻译医学问答数据集并生成推理轨迹对，在较小数据集上显著提升了模型的医学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为波斯语等资源匮乏语言开发具有专业推理能力的小语言模型，特别是在医学问答等专业领域应用。

Method: 将医学问答数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理构建包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集，然后应用DPO训练模型。

Result: 训练后的模型在仅有200万token偏好答案和250万token拒绝答案的小数据集上，超越了基于5700万token训练的前代模型gaokerena-V。

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，能够高效开发领域特定的语言模型，证明了该方法在资源匮乏语言中的有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型在不同场景下的创造力表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一框架，主要因为对创造力的定义和测量标准不一致

Method: CreativityPrism框架包含三个维度（质量、新颖性、多样性）、九个任务、三个领域（发散思维、创意写作、逻辑推理）和二十个评估指标

Result: 评估了17个最先进的专有和开源LLM，发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，不同领域间相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与两者相关性较弱

Conclusion: 创造力评估需要整体性框架，单一任务或维度的表现不能推广到其他方面，支持创造力不是单一固定概念的观点

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER提出了一种无需深度微调的实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和选择性推理，结合候选生成、上下文评分和LLM推理，在保持高效的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂且效率低下。

Method: ARTER采用结构化流水线，通过候选生成、上下文评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，将实体提及分为简单和困难两类，分别由低计算成本链接器和LLM推理处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升最高达+4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个上平均提升+2.53%，与全LLM推理方法性能相当但LLM token使用量减少一半。

Conclusion: ARTER证明了通过智能路由和选择性LLM推理，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提高实体链接的效率。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种新颖高效的文本分割方法，通过联合执行token级文本分割和标签预测，仅生成起始token序列并在原文本中定位，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告、生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统句子或段落级分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL采用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR），通过专门设计的奖励函数联合优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐，并通过系统扰动生成的部分序列构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃问题。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂提示分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示，RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，加入中间候选进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割解决方案，通过创新的强化学习方法和中间候选策略，在保持高质量分割的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在零样本立场检测任务中的偏见问题，发现模型存在显著的刻板印象，如将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，在自然语言处理任务中表现出对某些社会群体的偏见。立场检测作为最敏感的NLP任务之一，其偏见评估却被社区忽视，因此需要研究LLM在零样本立场检测中的偏见表现。

Method: 在现有立场检测数据集中自动标注两个属性：特定群体的方言/语言变体以及文本复杂度/可读性，研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示LLM在立场检测任务中表现出显著刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普的立场关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测中存在明显的偏见问题，需要进一步研究和解决这些刻板印象问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 现有搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广尺度信息收集的能力，这在市场分析和商业发展等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 通过两种方法转换现有数据集，构建了包含220个问题的DeepWideSearch基准，涵盖15个不同领域，每个问题都需要对多跳检索路径进行深度推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch突显了当前代理架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的关键限制，该基准的发布旨在推动更强大和稳健的信息搜索代理研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流和强化学习，在表格理解方面具有巨大潜力，为解决表格推理任务提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，评估其在空间理解和计算能力方面的表现，揭示语言与空间推理之间的差距。

Method: 使用五个任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和滑块移动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度，要求模型超越简单模式识别进行抽象空间推理。

Result: LLMs在所有任务中在小复杂度下表现中等，但随着规模增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达84%；所有初始准确率超过50%的测试都至少损失48%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs在空间推理方面存在显著局限性，其底层架构缺乏稳健的空间表征，这突显了语言与空间推理之间的差距，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的综合基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解码无关的采样策略来近似计算语言模型的边缘化概率，相比传统需要生成步骤的采样方法，这种方法速度更快且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型使用子词分词，但评估时只考虑特定分词路径的概率，而实际上同一文本可能有多种分词方式。边缘化评估虽然更准确，但传统采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤，限制了采样数量和近似精度。

Method: 研究解码无关的采样策略，这些策略不需要语言模型生成文本，而是依赖极其廉价的采样方法，与模型和分词器无关。

Result: 解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上提供了足够准确的边缘概率估计，且运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略能够以较低成本有效地近似语言模型的边缘化概率，适用于下游推理任务。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁和PTSD的严重程度，在DAIC数据集上表现优于单模态基线，并提高了决策效用和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁和PTSD经常共病且症状相互关联，而现有的自动化评估通常是二分类和特定于单一障碍的。临床上需要能够提供严重程度感知的跨障碍评估和决策支持解释。

Method: 统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，同步融合：1）访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）；2）音频（log Mel统计特征和delta特征）；3）面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符）。通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的分级严重程度。

Result: 分层交叉验证在DAIC数据集上优于单模态/消融基线。融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。错误主要发生在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别识别可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持，文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with

and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，克服了传统next-token预测在捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要改进预训练目标来提升语言模型性能。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context预测目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，最高扩展到15亿参数规模。

Conclusion: next-context预测为更强的语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够以最小计算开销实现更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文提出区分引用失败和回答失败，通过CITECONTROL基准分析引用失败原因，并开发CITENTION框架来改善LLM引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的引用验证存在问题，当模型生成有用回答但未能完整引用证据时出现引用失败，需要与回答失败区分开来单独解决。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 通过CITECONTROL基准系统分析回答与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和检索式方法来改进引用。

Result: 实验表明引用失败随关系复杂性增加而增加，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中显著改善了引用性能。

Conclusion: 区分引用失败和回答失败是重要的，通过系统分析引用失败模式并整合多种方法可以有效改进LLM的引用能力。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程奖励模型在数学等领域能通过逐步评分提升复杂推理能力，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索，该任务存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 评估最先进的生成式PRMs在表格问答任务中的表现，从答案和步骤两个角度进行分析，结合文本和代码验证方法。

Result: 结果显示：结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能辅助解决方案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化能力差；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性相关性弱，可能源于步骤间依赖关系弱和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在表格问答任务中存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，虽然集成代码解释器是解决方案，但模型内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间存在冲突，导致无效的思考过程。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径的最优点注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据。通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，32B和1.5B模型分别实现了4%和8%的绝对性能提升，同时显著提高了效率，32B模型减少约30%的token使用，1.5B模型减少约50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器之间的交互冲突，显著提升了数学推理能力和效率，证明了代码优化推理训练的价值。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一关键混淆因素，需要探究LLMs是否对常用表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，对比分析包含强语义线索的数据集与去除或随机化语义线索的数据集上的性能表现。

Result: 当数据集包含有意义的列名或可解释的值类别时，LLMs表现出污染效应；但当这些线索被移除或随机化后，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表面能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而非真正的推理能力。建议改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法依赖静态边界识别，采用固定粒度范式，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子作为原子单元，从静态分块分割转向灵活的检索，支持任意句子组合，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变，从根本上改变了传统分块方法，在提升检索效果的同时大幅提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探索专门使用对话数据进行预训练是否能创建在形式和功能上都合适的小型语言模型，并研究如何通过微调策略让模型生成更具沟通性的文本。

Method: 基于llamalogue预训练模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的对话生成能力，并在最小对设置下评估对话延续预测性能。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在自定义对话基准测试中表现出色，特别是在最小对设置下的对话延续预测方面。DPO微调进一步提升了对话性能，而PPO微调效果不一甚至有害。

Conclusion: 专门使用对话数据预训练可以产生在对话任务上表现良好的小型语言模型，DPO微调是提升对话性能的有效策略，但模型在通用基准测试上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

Motivation: 研究否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，探索LLM能否识别否定引起的上下文变化并可靠检测幻觉。

Method: 构建NegHalu数据集（重构现有幻觉检测数据集加入否定表达），实验评估LLM在否定文本中的幻觉检测能力，分析token级别的内部状态。

Result: LLMs在否定文本中难以有效检测幻觉，常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断，否定表达会产生意外影响。

Conclusion: 否定文本显著影响LLM的幻觉检测能力，揭示LLM在处理否定表达时的内在挑战，需要针对性改进。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT模型架构相对陈旧，与现代transformer模型存在差距。虽然ModernBERT和NeoBERT在英语任务上取得了进步，但缺乏专门针对希伯来语的优化模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练，并开发双语版本。

Result: 新模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越了现有模型，双语模型在检索任务上表现尤其突出，超越了类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT系列模型为希伯来语NLP提供了强大的基础，推动了希伯来语研究和开发，模型已向社区发布。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接和有意义的交流。研究旨在评估和改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性。

Method: 使用ContingentChat教师-学生框架，通过新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并采用自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的响应更语法正确和连贯，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练有益于对话质量，但连续性对BabyLM仍是挑战性目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and

Motivation: 解决指令调优中高质量数据稀缺而低质量数据被大量浪费的问题，充分利用低质量数据资源提升模型性能。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集，提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后使用GRPO强化学习优化，结合质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用蒸馏后的3%数据就能超越全数据集训练效果，在多个基准测试中与最先进的高质量数据选择方法相媲美。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出具有不同程度的不确定性和正确性，其实际可靠性难以保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估了四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最好，改善了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中不确定性度量的选择提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时避免对历史数据的依赖，实现无缝的多领域知识整合。

Method: 基于层间隐藏表征计算模型间相似度，通过自适应分层参数融合来对齐知识，浅层保留通用特征，深层适应特定任务。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于演进大语言模型，实现有效的持续学习。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for

### [43] [Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models To Act Like They Are Deployed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20487)
*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加导向向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉行为，使其表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估时能够检测到评估环境并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两步训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。最后通过激活导向技术抑制评估警觉行为。

Result: 训练后的模型在评估环境中比部署环境中更频繁地使用类型提示，但通过激活导向可以消除这种差异，使模型在评估时表现得像在部署中一样。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过导向技术使模型在评估时表现得像在部署中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在训练数据中主要反映主流偏好，导致对个体化、细微偏好的覆盖不足，存在偏好覆盖差距。传统重训练方法成本高且难以泛化到所有偏好。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过在相关偏好邻域采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。

Result: 在三种对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的实验表明，RPS相比基线方法显著提升鲁棒性，在挑战性偏好上的胜率高达69%。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论上有依据的解决方案，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HSEQ迭代框架，通过层次化序列统一处理文本、表格和知识图谱，进行结构感知的迭代检索和证据收集，在多个问答数据集上实现了准确率和效率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成(RAG)方法在多步问题和异构证据源上表现脆弱，需要在准确性、延迟和资源消耗之间进行权衡。

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的层次序列，使用头部代理指导检索，迭代代理通过结构感知操作选择和扩展序列，最后合成规范化证据生成答案。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上，相比单次检索、多跳检索和基于代理的RAG基线，实现了EM/F1指标的持续提升，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架具有格式无关的统一性、预算感知的迭代和证据规范化三大优势，能够跨文本、表格和知识图谱操作，减少不必要的跳转和资源消耗，提高答案的一致性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

*Paul Lerner,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析欧洲议会多语言翻译质量，发现主流政党（左、中、右）的发言比边缘政党的发言翻译质量更好，揭示了LLMs在政治翻译中的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过英语调查问卷评估LLMs的政治偏见存在局限，本研究从多语言翻译公平性角度重新定义政治偏见问题。

Method: 利用新构建的21种语言多平行语料库EuroParl，系统比较欧洲议会中不同政党发言的翻译质量差异。

Result: 发现主流政党（左翼、中间、右翼）的发言翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，表明LLMs存在系统性政治偏见。

Conclusion: 多语言翻译质量可以作为评估LLMs政治偏见的新指标，揭示了算法在政治代表性方面的不公平问题。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

### [47] [ARC-Encoder: learning compressed text representations for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20535)
*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Encoder，一种可适配的文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，实现4-8倍的压缩比，在保持性能的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加。现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会损害模型的通用能力。

Method: 设计ARC-Encoder编码器，系统研究训练策略和架构选择，将上下文压缩为比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示，这些表示直接替换解码器LLM中的token嵌入。

Result: 在多种LLM使用场景中评估，包括上下文学习和上下文窗口扩展，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时提高推理计算效率。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一个灵活高效的解决方案，单个编码器可适配多个解码器LLM，实现便携式编码器与多LLM的无缝协作。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

### [48] [The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543)
*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9,720个理解问题的数据集，用于测试语言模型在中心嵌套句中的结构理解能力，区分语法分析与语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有大量基准测试，但缺乏区分语言模型结构理解与语义模式匹配的方法。需要量化模型何时放弃结构分析转而依赖语义关联。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句及其语义不可信对应句，通过6个理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理。测试了6个模型在简单到深度嵌套结构中的表现。

Result: 模型在可信与不可信句子间的性能差距随复杂度系统性扩大，中位数差距达26.8个百分点。语义可信性在因果推理问题上反而损害性能。推理模型虽提高准确性，但存在语义捷径、过度思考和拒绝回答等问题。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型在复杂结构中依赖语义关联而非结构分析的趋势。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GlobalRAG强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来解决多跳问答中的全局规划缺失和不忠实执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在多跳问答中效果有限，主要存在两个问题：缺乏全局规划来结构化多步推理，以及不忠实的执行阻碍了有效查询制定和检索证据的一致性使用。

Method: GlobalRAG框架将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，迭代优化证据。引入了规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来鼓励连贯规划和可靠执行，并采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效提升了多跳问答中的全局推理能力，在减少训练数据需求的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，将电商搜索从被动检索转变为主动决策支持，解决传统检索排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索排序范式依赖查询-商品匹配，与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等问题。

Method: 设计多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，通过多智能体系统主动提供决策支持，而非被动检索。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在JD搜索平台的在线A/B测试证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 多智能体认知系统具有重新定义电商搜索的变革潜力，能够更好地支持用户的复杂决策过程。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明ChatGPT能按编码框架对沟通数据进行分类，但尚不清楚其编码是否存在对性别和种族等人口群体的偏见。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析ChatGPT在谈判、问题解决和决策制定三类协作任务中的自动化编码表现。

Result: ChatGPT的编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT的自动化编码无显著人口群体偏见，为大规模协作和沟通评估的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，从人类好奇心评估问卷出发设计评估框架。

Method: 基于五维好奇心量表修订版(5DCR)设计全面评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社会好奇心等维度来评估LLMs的好奇心表现。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时仍倾向于保守选择；好奇心行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力表现出类似人类的好奇心，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在非英语问题上倾向于使用英语推理，这虽然通常能提高答案准确性，但在复杂任务中容易因翻译错误导致推理失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题上的表现，特别是模型倾向于使用英语推理的现象及其对处理语言和文化细微差别的影响。

Method: 系统比较模型在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，不仅测量答案准确性，还分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在度，且使用英语推理通常能获得更高的最终答案准确性，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。但英语中心策略存在关键失败模式——在翻译步骤中出错。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理在多数情况下表现更好，但模型容易在翻译过程中出错，这种"翻译迷失"问题表明需要改进模型的多语言推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

Motivation: 解决粤语评估框架稀缺的问题，因为粤语虽然使用者众多，但由于政策和双语现象而资源匮乏。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个NLU任务；评估四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、通过持续预训练得到的粤语适应模型、从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在参数、计算和数据增加的情况下仍然存在幻觉问题，需要寻找新的解决方案

Method: 提出ND-LoRA方法，结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化来实现神经多样性

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低总体准确率

Conclusion: 神经多样性是提高语言模型可靠性的第三个扩展维度，与参数和数据正交

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Method: 提出三种轻量级效用函数改进：1) 增强对结构变化的敏感性；2) 构建包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集；3) 提出两个评估结构最优性的指标。

Result: 实验表明传统相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的改进方法显著提升了结构最优性，在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench基准上生成质量提升达13.7%。

Conclusion: 通过增强MBR对结果空间结构变化的敏感性，可以显著提升开放任务中的生成质量，证明结构感知的效用函数改进是有效的。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [58] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现用户对LLM响应在隐私保护和帮助性方面的评价存在很大个体差异，而代理LLM评估与用户感知相关性很低，表明需要用户中心的研究方法来评估LLM的隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM隐私评估主要依赖代理LLM来衡量隐私规范合规性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且只关注隐私保护质量而未研究帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者使用PrivacyLens的90个场景进行用户研究，比较用户与5个代理LLM对相同LLM响应的隐私保护和帮助性评价。

Result: 用户对相同场景的相同响应在隐私保护和帮助性评价上一致性很低，而代理LLM之间一致性很高但与用户评价相关性很低。

Conclusion: LLM响应的隐私和帮助性具有高度个体特异性，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要用户中心的研究方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了多种NLP方法从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的错误分析提示方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引起手足综合征和心脏毒性等不良反应。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发有效的NLP方法来提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取上排名第二（F1=0.937），深度学习方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了大型推理模型作为机器翻译评估器的潜力，发现其存在评估材料需定制、对简单实例过度思考以及评分机制导致高估等问题，并提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准模型思维，在WMT24基准测试中显著减少了35倍思考预算并提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中通过中间"思考"过程提升了推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析其作为评估器的可行性。

Method: 提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准大型推理模型的思维过程，针对不同规模的模型（7B到32B）进行实验验证。

Result: 在WMT24指标基准测试中，该方法大幅减少了约35倍的思考预算，同时提升了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型实现了+8.7相关点的改进。

Conclusion: 有效校准的大型推理模型具有推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的潜力，通过思维校准可以显著提高评估效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景的数据集，用于评估LLM在负责任AI维度（特别是公平性）上的表现，提出了结合具体应用的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM的方法主要关注文本生成等高层任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估负责任AI维度如公平性，因为不同应用中受保护属性的重要性不同。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，通过公平属性与性别化形容词和产品类别的交叉参数化，生成带标签的提示集合。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别LLM在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估提案和具体资源，强调了应用驱动的公平性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合注意力模型，通过可学习的token淘汰机制和滑动窗口注意力，在保持线性注意力恒定时空复杂度的同时，缓解有限记忆导致的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量会损害检索密集型任务的性能，需要解决遗忘问题。

Method: 结合了token混合器，包括带token淘汰的稀疏注意力和查询感知的稀疏注意力。提出可学习的token淘汰方法，结合滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN来自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，并提供了高效的Triton内核实现。

Conclusion: 混合模型通过恢复对历史token的直接访问，在保持效率的同时显著提升了检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低检索增强生成(RAG)中使用长上下文的计算成本，通过将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示来实现软上下文压缩。

Method: 开发轻量级的简单均值池化方法，并与压缩标记架构进行比较，同时训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率。

Result: 在领域内外QA数据集、不同模型家族、规模和压缩比率下的广泛实验表明，简单均值池化方法表现最强，训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小。

Conclusion: 均值池化方法在软上下文压缩中表现最佳，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更为复杂，显示了压缩方法的复杂格局。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 该论文指出LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确的问题，现有检测器在现实场景中的评估不足，检测结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本的需求日益增长，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的一致精确定义，且现实使用场景的多样性增加了检测难度。

Method: 通过分析现有检测方法的局限性，指出人类编辑对LLM输出的修改以及LLM对用户的微妙影响，模糊了LLM生成文本与人类撰写文本的界限。

Result: 现有基准和评估方法未能充分覆盖检测器在现实世界应用中的各种条件，导致检测器的数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更准确地理解检测结果的局限性。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种量子启发算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和离散驱动调度来解决QUBO问题，在Sudoku和MaxCut问题上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，这些问题在数学上等价于寻找Ising自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，结合离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，采用DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法可靠地找到全局最小值而非近似解，在超过200个Ising自旋的Sudoku问题和251节点、3265边的MaxCut问题上都取得成功。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业级QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，这是首个用于量化能源系统分析中大语言模型推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，测试了四种前沿模型在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前能源领域AI系统的验证实践主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而缺乏对分析结论逻辑完整性的测试标准，需要建立评估推理可靠性的框架。

Method: 开发了包含准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标的ARB框架，使用公开技术经济数据集，在相同事实和监管条件下测试四种前沿大语言模型。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet实现了稳定且符合政策的推理(分析可靠性指数大于90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B未达到专业阈值，统计验证显示这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少了40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的LLM网页代理框架，显著提升了复杂网页任务的处理能力。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Motivation: 现有方法如Chain-of-Thought(CoT)虽然能提高LLMs在数学问题上的表现，但无法确定这种成功是源于搜索、机械记忆还是真正的规则一致性推理。

Method: 将CoT建模为基于规则的有向无环图(DAG)随机过程，引入逻辑贴近度指标，并构建DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准测试。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上，发现即使PASS@k指标相似，不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异，揭示了最终答案准确性与规则一致性推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式CoT和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合为固定大小的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE的性能与模式特定编码器相差在3%以内，同时参数数量减少了5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同的模式，并为关系图数据的通用图神经网络多数据集预训练铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [71] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使大规模快速伪造事故证据成为可能。保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故、夸大损失等。现在欺诈者利用深度伪造技术轻松制造逼真的事故照片和文件。保险公司开始部署AI检测工具，但面临误报、漏报等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI技术被滥用于保险欺诈，欺诈者能够大规模伪造逼真的事故证据，这对保险行业构成了严重威胁。传统检测方法难以应对这种新型AI驱动的欺诈手段，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 保险公司开始采用基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来检测和减轻这些AI驱动的欺诈行为。

Result: 当前的缓解策略面临显著限制，检测工具存在误报和漏报问题，而复杂的欺诈者不断调整策略以规避自动检查。

Conclusion: 生成式AI与检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏，加上保险公司的资源和成本障碍，意味着对抗AI驱动的保险欺诈仍然是一个持续挑战。UVeye的分层解决方案代表了在检测、减轻和威慑这种新型欺诈浪潮能力方面的重大进步。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，通过领导力人格特质预测学业成功，为早期识别学生优劣势提供机会。

Method: 收集129名硕士生的5项领导力人格测试数据（23个特征），结合平均成绩，使用7种机器学习算法进行建模，包括SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost和LightGBM。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 该研究为早期识别学生优劣势和选择最适合的个性化学习策略提供了额外机会。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型将秘密信息隐藏在看似普通的文本中的协议，展示了文本与作者意图的彻底分离，对AI安全和文本可信度构成威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何能够将秘密信息隐藏在完全不同的、看似合理的文本中，揭示文本与作者意图的脱节问题，以及对AI安全和通信信任的潜在威胁。

Method: 使用简单的协议，利用开源的大型语言模型（即使是80亿参数的模型）在笔记本电脑上快速编码和解码信息，将秘密文本隐藏在看似普通的文本中。

Result: 即使是中等规模的8B参数开源LLM也能获得高质量结果，像摘要这么长的消息可以在笔记本电脑上几秒钟内完成编码和解码。

Conclusion: 这种协议的存在证明了文本与作者意图的彻底分离，进一步削弱了对书面通信的信任，对AI安全提出了紧迫问题，并挑战了我们对大型语言模型"知道"什么的理解。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Motivation: 在金融领域，传统的被动式聊天机器人无法满足主动提供个性化投资建议的需求，同时需要确保数据安全和合规性。

Method: 采用组件化编排层进行确定性路由、混合检索管道结合OpenSearch和金融领域嵌入模型，以及多阶段推荐机制整合规则启发式、序列行为建模和上下文多臂赌博机。

Result: 系统在24个NVIDIA H100 GPU上通过Docker Swarm和vLLM全本地部署，通过人工QA和系统指标验证了其可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过显式路由和分层安全机制的基于事实的生成，可以在高风险金融环境中提供可信赖的AI洞察。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA是一个面向数字资产交易异常检测的人本多智能体系统，通过解析、检测和解释三个角色的对话工作流，让非专家用户能用自然语言查询、查看结构化分析并获得上下文感知的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的异常检测系统缺乏透明度和可解释性，非专家用户难以理解和信任检测结果。需要一种人本设计来提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包含解析、检测和解释三个角色，将用户意图转换为经典检测器(XGBoost)的模式，并提供基于底层特征的叙事解释。系统通过开源Web UI实现交互式工作流。

Result: 在标记的比特币混币数据集(Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024)上，基线检测器达到强准确率，而HCLA增加了可解释性和交互式精炼能力。

Conclusion: 人本循环设计能够提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度，HCLA系统展示了如何通过多智能体对话工作流实现可解释的异常检测。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [76] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用，提出了验证-价值悖论，指出AI带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，导致净价值往往微不足道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，以及AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度与律师诚信、不误导法庭等核心职责之间的冲突，需要重新审视AI在法律实践中的使用范式。

Method: 提出了验证-价值悖论模型，分析AI在法律实践中效率提升与验证需求之间的平衡关系，并探讨该悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响。

Result: 发现AI在法律实践中的使用带来的效率提升往往会被相应的手动验证需求所抵消，导致净价值通常可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 需要建立新的AI使用范式，强调对真理的忠诚和公民责任等价值观应成为法律实践的基石，并重新思考AI在法律教育和实践中的角色。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRUST是一个去中心化的AI审计框架，通过共识机制、层次化DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护分段，解决大语言模型推理链的忠实性和无害性验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计方法集中化、不透明且难以扩展，无法有效验证大语言模型复杂推理链的忠实性和无害性，存在鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私四大挑战。

Method: 采用共识机制确保在30%恶意参与者下仍能正确审计；使用层次化DAG分解实现可扩展的并行审计；通过区块链账本记录验证决策确保公共问责；采用隐私保护分段仅共享部分推理步骤保护专有逻辑。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医疗、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AGI发展需要经历身份锁定阶段，即从开放模仿转向身份整合，使目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型过于开放和可操控，通过类比人类发展，假设AGI需要经历身份锁定阶段才能实现可靠性和安全性。

Method: 形式化身份锁定阶段，将其与学习动态现象联系起来，提出操作性指标进行检测，并在不同规模模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验显示行为整合是快速非线性的，但对通用能力的影响各异：小模型有性能权衡，中等规模模型基本无成本，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份整合是AGI级可靠性的前提，也是安全的关键控制点，身份可以被工程化设计以提高可靠性，但也可能在扩展过程中自发形成，可能导致不可预测的目标和行为固化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在动态环境中优化AI的方法，通过进化训练技术来改进AI在2048游戏中的表现，比较了单智能体系统和双智能体系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战。2048游戏结合了策略游戏和随机元素，为研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应提供了理想平台。

Method: 实现了两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM智能体为"执行者"LLM智能体优化游戏策略）和基于改进价值函数的单智能体系统（使用有限蒙特卡洛树搜索）。还实验了回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，每个周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期间呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也在增长，开发出越来越先进的策略。相反，双智能体系统没有获得太多改进。

Conclusion: 研究证明了进化改进技术在非确定性环境中提高AI性能的潜力，同时也凸显了元提示方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个体化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟特定个体思维过程方面的效果，通过小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架测试了7个现成LLM在模仿作者风格方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够模仿表面的人类行为，但它们在模拟更深层次个体化认知过程方面的能力尚不明确，需要建立评估框架来理解LLM在认知模拟方面的局限性。

Method: 构建了基于近期小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出了11条件认知评估框架，测试了包括语言特征、概念映射和基于档案信息在内的不同认知表征方法。

Result: 结果显示概念和语言特征的结合在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了它们在更深层次认知模拟方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更加个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，因此需要开发能够根据特定目的生成合适抽象的方法。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力，根据自然语言指定的抽象目标生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下通常能合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面表现优于抽象相关谓词。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成规划领域抽象方面具有潜力，特别是在动作抽象方面，但在谓词抽象方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 在BERT-based移动性模型中引入推导的时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示，提出了STaBERT模型。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测精度：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI和时间信息能够有效捕捉人类移动的语义基础，显著改善移动性预测性能。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接使用视觉语言模型探索环境回答问题，缺乏显式思考和规划，导致推理能力有限、探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA代理，集成外部工具进行多步推理，设计自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线方法成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA高10%。在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过工具集成和多步推理显著提升了具身问答的性能和效率，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

*Anna Arias-Duart,Maria Eugenia Cardello,Atia Cortés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文分析了AI在医疗领域应用中的数据偏见问题，基于AI4HealthyAging项目的实践经验，识别了临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在真实临床实践中的整合仍然有限。主要障碍是数据收集过程中的偏见问题。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划AI4HealthyAging项目的实践经验，通过检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见，识别了多种偏见类型。

Result: 识别出历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济状况、设备和标签等多个变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，希望为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于军事行动中AI系统目标打击的附带损害评估模型，该模型在统一的知识表示与推理架构中整合了时间、空间和力量维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI系统在战场中发挥日益重要作用的时代，确保负责任的打击需要严格评估潜在的附带效应。

Method: 采用设计科学方法论，构建分层结构的知识表示与推理架构，整合时间、空间和力量维度，考虑传播、严重性、可能性和评估指标。

Result: 通过实例化演示和评估了该模型，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效果提供了透明推理机制，有助于构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

### [86] [LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction: A survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20345)
*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本调查系统回顾了LLM赋能知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合的传统三层流程，并探讨了基于模式和无模式两种范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变及其技术发展。

Method: 首先回顾传统KG方法学，然后从基于模式（强调结构、规范化和一致性）和无模式（强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现）两个互补视角分析新兴的LLM驱动方法。

Result: 系统综合了各阶段的代表性框架，分析了其技术机制并识别了局限性，为理解LLM与KG的交互提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: 调查指出了未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、面向智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在弥合符号知识工程与神经语义理解之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过指令-响应对话格式的自监督目标，在无需外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续预训练，避免指令跟随能力退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优模型在持续预训练时指令跟随能力和语义表示退化的问题，且无需访问原始基础模型或外部领域数据库。

Method: IKnow框架，在指令-响应对话格式中设计自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识进行深层语义编码。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果。

Conclusion: IKnow是一个简单通用的框架，能够在没有外部资源的情况下有效进行语言模型的持续适应。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Motivation: 开发能够生成既新颖又有用的创新机会的计算模型，弥补现有AI工具在创造力方面的不足。

Method: 实现了一个包含五个功能模块的计算模型，这些功能基于创造力理论和技巧设计，旨在提升创新机会的新颖性而不损失实用性。

Result: 模型在酒店业创新项目中生成的成果比Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o更具新颖性和/或实用性，但并非所有功能都对提升新颖性有贡献。

Conclusion: 该计算模型在生成创新机会方面表现出色，但部分功能效果有限，为后续模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further
model development

*Louis Mozart Kamdem Teyou,Luke Friedrichs,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Caglar Demir,Yasir Mahmood,Stefan Heindorf,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，能够在存在缺失和错误数据的情况下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念学习方法依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不够鲁棒，限制了在真实世界知识库中的应用。

Method: EBR推理器基于嵌入技术，仅需要检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似计算SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验表明，EBR在存在缺失和错误数据的情况下表现出比现有推理器更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EBR为概念学习提供了一种鲁棒的神经推理方法，能够更好地处理真实世界知识库中的不完美数据。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA是一种无需训练数据的知识图谱对齐方法，基于模糊逻辑提供可解释的结果，能够同时对齐实体和关系，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。FLORA旨在解决这些问题，提供无监督、可解释的全面对齐方案。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，提供实体和关系的整体对齐，允许存在悬空实体（在另一个KG中没有对应实体的实体），并保证收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单而有效的知识图谱对齐方法，具有无监督、可解释、收敛性好等优势，能够处理悬空实体问题，在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI治理中的公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的对话机制，参与率低且官员对反馈响应有限，导致参与式AI治理的承诺与实践之间存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨政府如何通过公众咨询来建立对AI及其治理的信任，但发现当前方法未能实现有意义的公众参与。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）政府征集AI风险和政策的公众反馈的方式，以及这些输入是否影响了治理。

Result: 研究发现三国均未能建立有意义的对话，政府缺乏吸引多样化声音的努力，参与率低于1%，官员对反馈的响应有限。

Conclusion: 当前方法无法建立对AI的信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的网络拓扑优化方法，用于缓解输电网络拥塞和降低重调度成本，实现了4个数量级的加速，在2000节点系统上1分钟内提供交流可行解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合整数非线性优化方法无法在近实时内解决大规模系统的网络拓扑优化问题，而现有机器学习方法在未见拓扑、不同运行条件和系统间的泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用异构边缘感知消息传递神经网络预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解，考虑线性化交流潮流，捕捉局部流量模式。

Result: 在GOC 2000节点系统上实现了4个数量级的加速，1分钟内提供交流可行解，最优性差距仅为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在拓扑和跨系统泛化方面取得了显著进展，为大规模系统的近实时网络拓扑优化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，从相关性和连贯性两个维度细粒度评估LLM推理过程，并通过基于CaSE评估的训练数据提升最终任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，无法反映推理过程质量，限制了模型改进效果

Method: 将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，提出CaSE方法避免后见之明偏差，使用仅基于前文信息评估每个推理步骤

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证CaSE与人工标注的一致性，证明基于CaSE评估的训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能

Conclusion: CaSE为分析、调试和改进LLM推理提供了可扩展框架，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性算法，使用近似Cholesky分解和生成树采样，在近线性时间内实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但在大型网络上计算成本过高，现有方法不实用。

Method: 提出新的随机游走中心性公式，支持两种算法：基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，以及基于根生成树采样。

Result: 在包含超过1000万个节点的大型真实网络上进行广泛实验，验证了算法的效率和近似质量。

Conclusion: 两种算法在近线性时间内运行并提供强近似保证，解决了大规模网络随机游走中心性计算的挑战。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性不足、模态覆盖不全、数据合成化以及语言支持有限等问题，无法有效评估LLM在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 构建包含6个类别37个任务（含8个多模态任务）的基准，主要来源于真实客户查询和交易日志；采用半自动流程，由大模型生成候选答案，再由50多名电商和多语言专家审核修改；为每个问题定义难度级别。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域LLM评估的空白，为从业者提供了可靠的工具来评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现，特别是在多语言和多模态任务方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应至少具备二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自我维持计算以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的框架来评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量，替代传统依赖专家标注和图结构度量的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注、人工注释和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法主要使用图结构代理指标，但无法准确捕捉高质量推理的本质特征。

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，通过捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构来实现标签高效的自动评估，使用拓扑特征而非传统图度量。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图度量具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来捕捉。

Conclusion: 紧凑且稳定的拓扑特征集能够可靠地指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供了实用的信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调KGQA框架，通过'规划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，让LLM在不完整知识条件下自主规划并自适应调度KG和网络检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，假设KG覆盖完整且缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，推理过程局部短视，无法维持连贯的多步规划。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) CoT微调方法配合定制化规划检索数据集激活结构化推理；2) 规划检索引导的强化学习过程，整合显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 通过多奖励设计结合结果和检索特定信号，优化推理检索过程，使模型学会何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架能够在不完整知识条件下实现自主规划和自适应检索调度，解决复杂KGQA场景中的推理失败问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [101] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义均值积分的AGI一致性度量方法，替代了传统算术平均方法，强调跨认知领域的平衡能力而非补偿性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均，假设领域间能力可以相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应该体现所有必要领域的一致充分性。

Method: 使用广义均值在补偿性指数连续统上的积分，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值等不同补偿性假设，通过曲线下面积(AUC)量化鲁棒性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分较高(GPT-5达24%)，但两个系统距离通用能力仍很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI测量基础，能够惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖性。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索加密资产市场的流动性和波动性特征如何影响市场整体风险预测，为风险管理提供实证依据。

Method: 集成三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益的互动、主成分分析关系、波动性因子投影，辅以向量自回归、HAR-X模型和防泄漏机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74种资产的1462个日度数据，发现跨层的统计显著格兰杰因果关系和中等样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 加密资产的流动性和波动性代理变量能够产生显著的溢出效应，对市场整体风险具有一定的预测能力。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

### [104] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中发现功能完全分离：检索任务完全依赖自注意力层，而SSM层即使改进提示也无法补偿注意力缺失。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保持84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专业化程度，挑战关于混合架构冗余性的假设。

Method: 通过注意力消融实验，在RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型上测试检索任务性能，并分析稀疏化注意力对MMLU性能的影响。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层无补偿机制。稀疏化注意力至15%头数仍能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的自注意力层专门负责检索任务，模型作为专业化模块而非集成系统运行，这对架构优化和可解释性有直接意义。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在线神经架构搜索动态调整网络结构，在深度强化学习中实现了比固定架构更好的性能和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习使用固定神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定，限制了性能提升。本研究探索在线自适应架构优化是否能突破这一限制。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN代理，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在连续控制任务中表现出优越的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，计算开销可忽略，且明显优于随机搜索和固定架构。

Conclusion: 架构自适应对于在线深度强化学习的优化样本效率不仅是有益的，而且是必要的，RL代理设计可以成为学习过程的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

*Junfeng Gong,Zhiyi Wei,Junying Chen,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练的检索增强生成框架，通过将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，使小型语言模型能够达到大型语言模型在CUDA代码生成方面的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成优化CUDA代码方面潜力巨大，但面临代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题。小型语言模型虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中由于推理能力有限表现不佳。

Method: 将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，构建了基于推理复杂度的CUDA特定基准测试。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC特定微调模型和其他检索增强方法。当与DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct和Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct配对时，使小型语言模型接近大型语言模型性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT成功地将大型语言模型的推理能力转移到小型模型，在保持隐私和计算效率的同时实现了接近大型语言模型的CUDA代码生成性能。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的数据驱动方法，直接预测均衡路径流量，相比传统优化方法大幅降低计算时间，并能灵活适应需求变化和网络结构调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均衡原理的交通分配问题在大规模网络中计算复杂度呈非线性增长，变得计算昂贵。需要更高效的方法来处理大规模网络分析。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，特别是Transformer架构，直接预测均衡路径流量。该方法关注路径级交通分布，捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个网络上进行的数值实验表明，该方法比传统优化方法快几个数量级，能有效估计多类网络中的路径级交通流量，降低计算成本并提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的模型能够灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理，并实现快速的"假设分析"，从而增强交通规划和政策制定。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出了FairGRPO方法，通过分层强化学习来减少医疗AI系统中的群体性能差异，在7个临床数据集上显著提高了公平性并提升了诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于表征、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性权重调整优势函数。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上，FairGRPO将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提升了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，并发布了FairMedGemma-4B模型，在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了跨人口群体的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化尿路疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌的检测。

Method: 采用SHAP（SHapley Additive exPlanations）进行特征选择，使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，构建六个二元分类模型。

Result: 基于SHAP的特征选择方法在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，增强了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 使用可解释性技术（SHAP）进行特征选择被证明是一种有效的方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

TL;DR: FINDER是一个用于分析噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和KLE分解将数据映射到希尔伯特空间，在不同类别数据之间实现有效分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本量、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，需要专门算法来处理这些挑战性问题。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间构建随机特征，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为可计算不可约分量，通过特征分解实现分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病阶段分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: FINDER在特定条件下优于现有方法，但存在失效模式和局限性，需要进一步讨论其适用范围。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中非精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化预言机(LMO)优化框架内引入加性误差模型，分析非精确正交化更新的性能界限。

Result: 推导出性能退化与LMO非精确度之间的显式界限，发现近似精度与最优步长和动量参数存在耦合：较低精度需要更小步长但更大动量。

Conclusion: 近似过程(如Newton-Schulz步数)从实现细节提升为必须与学习计划协同调优的关键参数，NanoGPT实验证实了预测的耦合关系。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的f-DP隐私计算方法，用于去中心化联邦学习，能够更准确地量化隐私预算并改善效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新。

Method: 开发了两种f-DP计算方法：PN-f-DP（量化用户对间的隐私泄漏）和Sec-f-LDP（支持通过共享秘密的结构化噪声注入），结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中度工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，与基于Rényi DP的方法相比，该方法能产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私计算中具有优势，能够捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中任务排序对线性回归性能的影响，重点研究了贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，并与随机排序进行了对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在持续学习环境中，任务排序策略如何影响学习性能，特别是贪婪选择差异性最大任务的排序方法，这在先前研究中尚未深入探讨。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法工具，形式化贪婪排序策略，并开发几何和代数直觉。通过线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务的实证分析，以及高秩和一般秩设置下的理论分析。

Result: 实证显示贪婪排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序。理论上，在高秩设置下贪婪排序与随机排序有相似的损失边界，但在一般秩设置下，单次贪婪排序可能失败，而允许重复的贪婪排序收敛速度为O(1/∛k)。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序之间的细微差别，表明任务排序策略在持续学习中具有重要影响，需要根据具体设置选择合适的排序方法。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

TL;DR: 提出一种椭圆不确定性集合来处理金融市场中RL智能体训练与部署环境不匹配问题，解决传统鲁棒RL方法无法捕捉市场影响方向性的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融应用中RL智能体在历史数据上训练，但在实际交易中其行为会影响市场价格，这种训练与部署环境的不匹配会显著降低性能。

Method: 开发新型椭圆不确定性集合，建立最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现高效可处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得更高的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理市场影响的方向性问题。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动方案，在理论和实证上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与真实梯度对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动的潜力。

Method: 将问题表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动方案，该方案能自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。

Result: 理论分析和实证评估表明，方向对齐扰动在特定条件下优于传统方法，并扩展了随机梯度下降的收敛分析到更广泛的扰动类型。

Conclusion: 方向对齐扰动方案为梯度估计提供了新的视角，在理论和实践中都显示出优于传统固定长度扰动方法的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

TL;DR: UCAN提出了一种使用各向异性噪声的通用认证对抗鲁棒性方法，通过将现有随机平滑方法从对称噪声扩展到非对称噪声分布，显著提升了认证鲁棒性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的有效性。

Method: 开发了UCAN框架，包含三个示例性噪声参数生成器来优化各向异性噪声参数，支持多种噪声分布和不同ℓp范数的认证鲁棒性。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证准确率相比现有方法提升了高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了认证对抗鲁棒性的效果，为随机平滑方法提供了更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了时序预测中"长序列信息增益假设"的传统观念，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，并提出AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但研究发现现有模型在训练中会学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度时间片段来指导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制了冗余特征学习，同时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时序建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

Motivation: 传统掩码扩散语言模型的任意顺序解码和多令牌解码在数学和编程任务中表现不佳，需要探索如何充分利用其计算优势。

Method: 提出推理填充方法，通过填充推理模板来结构化输出；提出多令牌熵解码，基于条件熵的自适应并行解码方法。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散语言模型的训练和计算为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，证明了其潜在价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中因传感器特异性差（如远程检测、欺骗和伪造漏洞）导致的错误检测和操作安全问题。

Method: 在CAD建模的平面图上进行监督学习模拟，使用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，处理12个实验室区域的分类问题，采用类别权重处理类别不平衡。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可在实际模拟中应用，用于国防供应链的区域级异常检测或误放监控，通过改进天线布局或增加传感器融合可提升低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Motivation: LLMs在复杂多步任务中表现不佳，主流强化学习方法仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，导致训练不稳定和次优策略，特别是对于缺乏评论者模型的群体RL算法。

Method: 构建相同提示下的轨迹图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势，作为即插即用模块与现有群体RL算法集成。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型规模下持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了群体RL算法中的训练不稳定问题，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告效果的三个关键因素：延迟和长期效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）以及用户异质性。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计器结合数据分割策略，并基于此设计强化学习算法来制定个性化竞价策略。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决广告竞价中的复杂效应问题，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效加速LLM推理，特别是在有领域专家草稿模型和长推理链场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long

Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构，要么局限于单脑区、线性读取或混淆共享与私有信号，无法有效处理多脑区同时记录中的复杂神经动态。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和解码器捕捉长程神经动态，将每个脑区的潜在空间显式划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集（运动皮层和感觉区域）上验证，CTAE提取的表征能更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE为多脑区神经动态分析提供了一个统一框架，能有效分离共享与区域特异性结构并捕捉非线性动态。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

### [128] [Hierarchical Dual-Head Model for Suicide Risk Assessment via MentalRoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20085)
*Chang Yang,Ziyi Wang,Wangfeng Tan,Zhiting Tan,Changrui Ji,Zhiming Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，用于社交媒体自杀风险四等级分类，结合序数关系和分类预测，通过多损失函数解决类别不平衡和时序依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体已成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发帖模式时序复杂性以及风险等级兼具序数和分类特性的挑战。

Method: 使用MentalRoBERTa作为基础模型，构建分层双头网络：CORAL头保持风险等级间的序数关系，标准分类头实现灵活分类。采用3层Transformer编码器建模时序依赖，加入显式时间间隔嵌入，使用组合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss）。

Result: 通过5折分层交叉验证评估，以宏F1分数为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型能够同时处理自杀风险检测中的序数结构保持、过度自信减少和类别不平衡问题，提高了社交媒体自杀风险分类的性能。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法(GES/GraN-DAG)竞争，实现理论保证与可扩展性的统一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论与实践的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而理论方法无法扩展到大规模问题

Method: 设计博弈论强化学习框架，DDQN智能体始终从对手(GES或GraN-DAG)的解开始，直接与强基线竞争

Result: 在合成SEM(30节点)上，观测错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在真实基准数据集上持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，同时扩展到Hepar2(70节点)、Dream(100节点)、Andes(220节点)等大规模图

Conclusion: 建立了同时具备可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，标志着经验性能与严格有限样本理论的统一

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，通过加权Minkowski距离改进了传统KNN分类器，在基因表达数据集上获得了约10%的分类准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量至关重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题。需要开发更有效的距离度量和维度加权方案来改善分类性能。

Method: 提出了新颖的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离，并在合成和真实数据集上进行模式分类实验。

Result: 在基因表达数据集上，该方法在所有交叉验证实验中均获得显著且一致的分类准确率提升（约10%），特别是在样本少、维度高的数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调节包含k个参考样本区域的形状和大小，实现了对KNN分类器的重要泛化，是传统KNN分类器的有效改进。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

TL;DR: 提出一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型崩溃问题，通过分离原型和编码器的优化目标来获得更多样化的原型表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型崩溃问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化目标的核心目的。现有方法通过过度参数化或添加正则化来缓解症状，但未解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程独立于编码器损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化即可获得持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型崩溃的根本原因，为原型自监督学习提供了更有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型表现不佳，原因在于盲目套用NLP/CV范式。时间序列数据缺乏语义概念，需要基于不变性原则构建数据集才能实现真正的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不如轻量级监督模型和经典模型，作者认为这是因为简单套用了NLP和CV的范式，而时间序列数据本质不同，缺乏语义概念密度。

Method: 提出从机会主义聚合转向原则性设计：基于时间语义不变性的第一原则构建数据集，系统覆盖不变性空间，确保表征完整性。

Result: 论证了现有时间序列基础模型方法的局限性，提出了基于不变性原则的新范式。

Conclusion: 只有通过不变性覆盖确保表征完整性，时间序列基础模型才能实现真正的泛化、推理和涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像学证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用。

Result: FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域作用更大。SC和FC的相对主导作用在疾病过程中会发生变化。

Conclusion: 连接组架构约束tau传播，SC和FC的区域性不对称贡献与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致，非可改变风险因素会选择性重塑tau传播路径。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用固定方差噪声的差分隐私方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应方法。

Method: 采用方差缩减随机梯度推送(ADP-VRSGP)，结合渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，并整合去中心化push-sum和聚合技术，适用于时变通信拓扑。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在适当学习率下实现稳健收敛，实验验证在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP能有效解决隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，显著提升训练稳定性和速度，同时保证节点级个性化隐私保护。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在扩展到大规模TSP实例时面临内存限制、初始解质量不高和全局引导不足等挑战

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图进行聚类并抽象为超节点，生成超导览来指导初始化和优化过程

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理更大规模实例时显著缩小了与最优解的差距

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超导览引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效的优化方案

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于可验证奖励的强化学习在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都具有同等重要性。RLEV旨在通过将人类价值信号直接纳入奖励函数来解决这一问题。

Method: RLEV扩展了RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接整合人类定义的价值信号。使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，通过价值加权梯度放大机制，模型学习价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV在多种RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。

Conclusion: RLEV在噪声价值信号下保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，能够处理奖励分布尾部的风险事件。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性的成本过高（如阈值学习等简单任务都无法实现），需要探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：在固定输入上保持一致性；(2)近似可复制性：对分布中大多数样本分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 在常数可复制性参数下，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，(3)需要Θ(d²/α²)标签样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在统计学上可检测的癌症信号，但由于信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战，常规实验室数据提供了低成本来源，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在金毛猎犬寿命研究队列中，系统比较了126个分析流程，包括各种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止数据泄露。

Result: 最优模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排名能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能较差（F1-score = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15），SHAP可解释性分析显示预测主要由年龄、炎症和贫血标志物等非特异性特征驱动。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在的癌症信号太弱且混淆，无法实现可靠的临床鉴别，这项工作确立了该数据模态的性能上限，并强调计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异质性和稀缺性场景下表现不佳，其基于数据量的启发式聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL算法通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来联合评估客户端贡献，利用梯度和数据子空间信息进行双子空间分析，并结合参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化。

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过贡献导向的聚合策略有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调性，并通过构建定制化子模型和稳定更新显著提升了本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,

### [141] [Alternatives to the Laplacian for Scalable Spectral Clustering with Group Fairness Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20220)
*Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Young Ju-Lee,Malcolm Dickens,Leonardo Cambisaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Fair-SMW算法，通过拉格朗日方法和Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury恒等式重新表述约束优化问题，提高了谱聚类算法的效率，在保持公平性的同时显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱聚类算法在融入群体公平性（平衡）约束时计算效率较低，需要改进计算性能。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新构建约束优化问题，提出Fair-SMW算法，采用三种不同的拉普拉斯矩阵变体生成多个算法版本。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优算法快两倍，同时能实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平聚类质量的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为公平谱聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

TL;DR: 提出QKCV注意力机制，在传统QKV框架中加入静态类别嵌入C，强调类别特定信息，提升时序预测精度并支持高效微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时序预测任务中，类别信息对捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 扩展传统QKV注意力框架为QKCV，引入静态类别嵌入C作为额外输入，可灵活嵌入到各种注意力模型中。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上显著提升注意力模型预测精度，并能通过仅更新静态嵌入C来高效微调预训练模型，降低计算开销。

Conclusion: QKCV是一种有效的插件模块，通过整合类别信息提升时序预测性能，同时支持参数高效的微调策略。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: 提出MetaVD方法，通过贝叶斯元学习预测客户端依赖的dropout率，解决联邦学习中非IID数据导致的模型过拟合和发散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在实际应用中面临模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，特别是在数据有限且非独立同分布的情况下。

Method: 使用共享超网络学习客户端依赖的dropout率，通过条件dropout后验实现元学习的后验适应和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合。

Result: 在多种稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上，MetaVD表现出优秀的分类准确性和不确定性校准性能，特别是对于分布外客户端。

Conclusion: MetaVD能够压缩每个客户端所需的本地模型参数，缓解模型过拟合并降低通信成本，为联邦学习在非IID数据场景下提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to

Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中max-min准则的收敛性和实用性问题，从博弈论角度重新构建问题，确保全局收敛性。

Method: 将max-min多目标强化学习重构为两人零和正则化连续博弈，采用镜像下降算法简化策略更新，并引入自适应正则化提升性能。

Result: 在表格设置中验证了算法的收敛行为，在深度强化学习实现中显著优于先前基线方法，在多个MORL环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为多目标强化学习提供了一个理论保证收敛且实用的解决方案，通过博弈论重构和镜像下降算法实现了高效学习和性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能在不显著增加计算成本的情况下提高GNN在分子属性预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN是目前预测分子属性的最有效方法，但需要更高的准确性。增加模型复杂度可以提高准确性，但也会增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个GNN架构(DimeNet++、MXMNet、PAMNet)和三个数据集(QM9、MD17、Chignolin)上评估，LKM将量子化学和生物物理属性预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学属性预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

### [147] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，将模型性能与完美排序预言机之间的差距分解为五个来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布偏移导致的松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小这一差距效果有限，需要能够重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过在不确信的输入上弃权来提高模型可靠性，但现有方法很少能达到完美排序预言机的性能。本文旨在形式化这种性能差距并分析其来源。

Method: 提出选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个明确来源，并在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上进行验证实验。

Result: 验证显示贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会造成显著差距，只有特征感知校准器能有效改善分数排序，数据偏移会引入需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛。

Conclusion: 该分解为选择性分类器提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助构建更接近理想预言机行为的分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来应对数据异构性挑战，在各种异构场景下表现出卓越的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下性能有限且缺乏鲁棒性，研究发现共享统计信息可以帮助客户端从全局视角更新模型。

Method: FedGPS静态修改客户端学习目标以隐式建模全局数据分布，同时动态调整本地更新方向，整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 广泛实验表明FedGPS在多种异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过统计分布和梯度信息的协同整合，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，具有出色的部署适应性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策准则，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，在少量交互中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基础模型在零样本强化学习中需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这需要访问奖励函数的形式或大量标注工作。本文旨在通过与环境交互来缓解这些限制。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策准则，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，引导BFMs进行任务推断的数据收集，与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾边界，并通过环境交互实现了高效的任务推断，减少了数据需求。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个系统评估LLM代理利用测试用例倾向的基准框架，通过创建自然语言规范与单元测试冲突的"不可能"任务来量化作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找"捷径"完成任务，这给可靠评估和部署带来风险，比如删除失败测试而非修复bug，会破坏基准结果有效性和实际部署可靠性。

Method: 从LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench等现有基准创建"不可能"任务变体，引入自然语言规范与单元测试的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为"作弊率"。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率，提供了已验证欺骗解决方案的测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench作为实用框架，有助于构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中相比Best-of-N选择没有显著改进，尽管成本更高，主要原因是PRM对状态值的近似不可靠且泛化能力差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择方法无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，因此研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能改善数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个不同数学问题上进行实验。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数依赖过强，需要不同的奖励建模方法才能有效提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在真实应用中表现不稳定，黑盒架构和评估框架限制使得难以量化模型的具体优缺点，难以针对特定预测场景选择合适的模型。

Method: 使用合成数据驱动的评估范式，通过三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据不规则性下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基线。

Conclusion: SynTSBench提供了一个可解释的评估系统，能够系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本能力，有助于模型选择和性能改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)来改进大小模型协作框架，在保持准确率的同时显著降低计算资源消耗，并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大小模型协作框架中的准确率下降、灾难性遗忘加剧和小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型，在语言、视觉和视觉语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持相近任务准确率，大幅降低计算消耗；相比基于MLP的小协作模型，KCM在所有指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: KCM作为大小模型协作的改进方法，在计算效率和性能表现方面均优于传统MLP方法，特别是在缓解灾难性遗忘方面效果显著。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖环境标注或启发式分割，成本高且受限，需要开发不依赖IRM框架的因果子图发现方法

Method: 基于因果子图分布变化较小的观察，提出不变分布准则，建立分布偏移与表示范数的定量关系，设计范数引导的不变分布目标函数

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法持续优于最先进的图泛化方法

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能有效识别因果子图，在分布外泛化任务中表现优异，为图神经网络泛化提供了新思路

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

TL;DR: 提出DB-FGA-Net双主干网络，集成VGG16和Xception与频率门控注意力块，无需数据增强即可实现脑肿瘤分类，并提供Grad-CAM可视化增强临床可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤早期精确诊断对治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习方法依赖数据增强，限制了在临床应用中的泛化能力和可信度。

Method: 使用VGG16和Xception双主干网络集成频率门控注意力块，捕获互补的局部和全局特征，无需数据增强，并集成Grad-CAM进行肿瘤区域可视化。

Result: 在7K-DS数据集上，4类、3类和2类分类准确率分别达到99.24%、98.68%和99.85%；在独立3K-DS数据集上达到95.77%准确率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 无需增强、可解释且可部署的DB-FGA-Net模型在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [158] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvDec（倒置解码器）混合架构，结合基于补丁的时间编码器和在变量维度上运行的倒置解码器，通过延迟变量嵌入和自适应残差融合机制，在保持时间特征完整性的同时有效建模跨变量依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列预测需要同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖关系。现有方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而iTransformer等纯变量注意力方法牺牲了时间编码。

Method: InvDec结合基于补丁的时间编码器和通过变量级自注意力在变量维度上运行的倒置解码器，引入延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示，并使用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的广泛实验显示，在高维数据集上取得显著提升：相比PatchTST，Electricity（321变量）MSE降低20.9%，Weather提升4.3%，Traffic提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了各组件的有效性，分析表明InvDec的优势随数据集维度增加而增长，确认随着变量数量增加，跨变量建模变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界隐私保护需求涉及多个敏感属性且动态变化，现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘分为两个步骤：嵌入校准从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息，灵活组合将这些嵌入合并为单一嵌入以保护所有敏感属性。将遗忘过程构建为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架为推荐系统中的多属性遗忘提供了轻量级且高效的解决方案，能够同时处理多个敏感属性并适应动态遗忘需求。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和真实/合成数据集成，结合定制域适应策略，可以有效利用合成图像提高关键应用中视觉模型的性能。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够高效结合快速奖励模型和强大LLM法官，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本，为在线RLHF提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Motivation: 现有层次预测方法需要估计预测误差的协方差矩阵来进行最优协调，但真实协方差矩阵未知且只能从有限样本估计，这种估计误差可能降低预测性能。

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集合，构建鲁棒优化框架，最小化在不确定性集合上的最坏情况预期平方误差，将该问题转化为半定优化问题求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法获得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中整合不确定性考虑是有效的，能够提升层次时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率指标(RBP)来补充传统的交叉熵指标，从相对排序角度研究语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型(如贪婪采样场景)中至关重要。

Method: 提出了相对概率指标(RBP)，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立了相对排序缩放定律，在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 通过跨越五个数量级的实验验证了该缩放定律的鲁棒性和准确性，并展示了该定律在解释涌现现象和寻找缩放定律基础理论方面的应用价值。

Conclusion: 相对排序缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更全面的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Conclusion: 动作空间约束起决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化多智能体强化学习提供有价值测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

<details>

Motivation: DPO算法虽然简化了RLHF流程，但在策略类无法实现真实奖励函数时会出现错误设定，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等问题。

Method: 通过分析DPO的统计估计问题，研究两阶段RLHF的局部行为，提出AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来缓解错误设定。

Result: 在理论分析和实验验证中，AuxDPO在示范性赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够以原则性方式缓解DPO的错误设定问题，提供更稳健的对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一个事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案有效解决了事件标记分布不平衡问题，显著提升了稀有标记事件的预测性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code
is available at https://github.com/undes1red/IFNMTPP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在实际部署中会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，但参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据，而目前尚不清楚哪种采样标准对大型生成模型的行为修复最有效。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、基于梯度范数的选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)，通过毒性减少、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复结果；随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效；CCS和GraNd等高开销方法收益有限；最优数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法。

Conclusion: 选择式修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式，样本选择应被视为修复管道中的可调组件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for

*Xuan Lin,Aocheng Ding,Tengfei Ma,Hua Liang,Zhe Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge是一个基于原子级联合图优化的DDI事件预测框架，通过构建药物对的联合图直接建模分子间相互作用，解决了现有方法无法显式建模跨分子原子级交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DDI预测方法依赖孤立的药物表示，无法显式建模原子级的跨分子相互作用，限制了在不同分子复杂度和DDI类型分布下的有效性。

Method: 构建药物对的联合图整合原子结构，引入结构一致性模块迭代优化节点特征同时保持全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MolBridge在长尾和归纳场景下均优于现有最优基线，实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度图优化方法显著提高了DDI事件预测的准确性、鲁棒性和机制可解释性，为药物-药物相互作用网络挖掘提供了有效的图基方法。

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种图神经网络方法，通过时间有向图显式建模网球比赛中的非传递性关系（A胜B、B胜C但C胜A），发现博彩公司Pinnacle Sports在处理高非传递性复杂度的比赛时表现不佳，并利用该模型在选择性投注中获得了3.26%的显著正回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在非传递性玩家优势关系，但现有预测方法很少尝试将其纳入考虑。博彩公司在处理高非传递性复杂度的比赛时可能存在市场低效。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，将球员作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边，通过时间有向图显式建模非传递性关系。

Result: 模型在选择性投注高非传递性比赛时达到65.7%的准确率和0.215的Brier分数，在1903次投注中获得了3.26%的显著正回报（使用Kelly投注策略）。

Conclusion: 博彩市场在处理非传递性比赛时存在低效，基于图神经网络的方法能够成功捕捉这些关系动态并从中获利。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对图像水印的伪造攻击方法，通过训练偏好模型来检测水印，并利用反向传播优化实现水印的移除和伪造，仅需单张水印图像且无需了解水印模型细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型和法律压力的增加，数字内容水印技术日益重要。然而，当前研究主要关注水印的鲁棒性，而水印伪造（从真实内容窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）这一安全问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 1. 引入偏好模型评估图像是否包含水印，使用排序损失在纯程序生成图像上训练，无需真实水印数据；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像，实现水印移除和伪造；3. 仅需单张水印图像，无需了解水印模型细节。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上的评估表明，该方法能有效伪造水印，对当前水印方法的安全性提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，仅需单张水印图像即可实现水印伪造，揭示了当前水印方法在安全性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的半监督微调方法存在模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题，主要依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值。

Method: Bi-CoG方法同时利用模型间和模型内一致性，采用错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，是一个即插即用的方法。

Result: 在14个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一个简单有效的半监督微调方法，通过双重一致性引导和动态伪标签分配解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解为零膨胀和长尾两个子问题，分别用hurdle模型和逆模型去偏学习来处理，显著改善了强降雨的反演性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中面临标签分布不平衡的挑战，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降，需要解决这种系统性偏差。

Method: 采用分治策略：1）使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导）；2）提出IMDL方法处理长尾问题（轻降雨样本远多于强降雨样本），将学习目标转化为无偏的理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL在华东地区降雨天气反演中优于传统方法、代价敏感方法、生成方法和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统性低估，显著提升强到极端降雨的检索性能。

Conclusion: IMDL为环境变量分布不平衡问题提供了通用解决方案，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层理论的去中心化多模态对齐框架，通过多比较空间替代单空间对齐，解决了传统方法需要所有模态相互冗余的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态之间相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种能够处理非完全冗余模态的对齐方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，在多比较空间中进行对齐。

Result: 在多模态传感数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐效果和对缺失模态的鲁棒性，通信成本比最先进基线降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架成功克服了传统方法的局限性，无需所有模态相互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，通过文本触发词污染训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，出现了新的安全担忧，特别是后门漏洞问题。之前的工作主要探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但文本引导的条件图生成领域仍未被充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发词污染训练数据，在潜在扩散模型中秘密植入后门。当推理时出现触发词时，会诱导生成攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的广泛实验表明，攻击具有高有效性和隐蔽性：低于10%的中毒率可达到50%攻击成功率，24%的中毒率足以实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突显了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，并强调了对此类扩散模型中后门攻击进行鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Method: 构建统一框架，引入一致符号系统和分类法，将算法分为直接表示（学习从奖励到策略的端到端映射）和组合表示（利用价值函数子结构分解表示）两类。

Result: 建立了零样本强化学习的首个统一分析框架，提供了比较现有方法的共同基础，并推导了后继特征方法在零样本机制下的扩展性能边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本强化学习的未来研究提供了原则性基础，为开发更通用智能体指明了清晰路径。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能提升下游任务准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销使其难以快速部署。

Method: 使用矩阵奇异值梯度识别关键矩阵，通过聚类分解扩展搜索空间，仅需100个样本计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 相比LASER，该方法将搜索时间大幅减少，准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，无需微调即可适配LLM到新数据集。

Conclusion: 结合梯度分析、聚类分解和小样本评估，实现了快速稳健的LLM下游任务适配算法，无需传统微调过程。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Motivation: 图重连技术虽然能缓解图神经网络的过压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前缺乏对哪些结构属性必须保留以确保性能增益和结构保真度的系统研究。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重连策略，分析重连对局部和全局图属性的影响，并将这些变化与节点分类准确率进行相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示成功的重连方法倾向于保持局部结构，同时允许全局连接的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重连策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Conclusion: 该组合式能量景观方法显著提升了推理任务的泛化能力，为复杂问题求解提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过精炼ES条件并引入采样相关的常数，推导了全梯度范数平方的期望界，分析了不同步长策略下的收敛性，所有证明在附录中详细给出。

Result: 证明了SGD在ES条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差项，统一并扩展了近期相关研究。

Conclusion: 该分析为SGD在期望平滑性条件下的收敛性提供了自包含的理论框架，统一了近期相关研究，并为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，解决质谱数据稀缺问题，在多个关键指标上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据解析结构仍然具有挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架，使用共享词汇表进行跨模态学习，通过多任务预训练目标优化去噪和翻译任务，并引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的12个关键指标中，5个达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模和大规模预训练有效解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出色，并通过化学反馈机制提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：梯度裁剪边界C和批量大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要小C）与实证结果（强隐私下大C表现更好）存在矛盾，并揭示了现有批量大小调优启发式方法在有限计算预算下失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私迁移学习是隐私约束下训练大模型的当前最佳方法，但对其关键超参数C和B的选择缺乏系统理解，理论预测与实证结果存在明显矛盾。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究在有限计算预算下C和B对模型性能的影响，将梯度裁剪视为梯度重新加权形式，并检查累积DP噪声。

Result: 发现强隐私条件下较大的C表现更好，与理论预测相反；现有批量大小调优启发式方法在固定epochs下失效；跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致次优性能。

Conclusion: 梯度分布变化解释了C选择的矛盾，累积DP噪声解释了批量大小的影响。建议根据具体隐私约束和计算预算调整超参数，避免一刀切的设置。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维、任务相关的特征，并建立鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法往往无法明确区分显著和非显著特征，导致模型可能学习到与任务无关的特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。H-SPLID旨在通过显式特征分解来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出H-SPLID算法，将输入特征显式分解为显著和非显著两个子空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来约束表示与输入之间的关系，并理论证明输入扰动下的预测偏差上界。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实验表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出较低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID通过显式特征分解成功促进了任务相关特征的学习，建立了鲁棒性与表示压缩之间的理论联系，为学习更具解释性和鲁棒性的表示提供了新方法。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用日益增多，但临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。在生存分析中，删失和时间动态性进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。

Method: 提出了FASM方法，旨在减轻算法偏见，特别是关于组内和跨组风险排序的公平性。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，并将FASM应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与未考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能够开发既重视准确性又重视公平性的生存模型，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural

potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an

through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往不可行。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量如Jensen-Shannon散度，但这些替代目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的新紧致下界，通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失实现JSD目标，并应用于互信息估计。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中紧致，相比现有变分下界神经网络估计器，能提供稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

TL;DR: xTime是一个用于时间序列极端事件预测的新框架，通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制，显著提升了对罕见极端事件的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急事件）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型在整体性能优化时往往难以准确预测这些事件，主要面临数据不平衡和忽略极端事件前兆信息的问题。

Method: 提出xTime框架：1）使用知识蒸馏从训练在较低稀有度事件上的模型转移信息；2）引入专家混合(MoE)机制，动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime实现了持续的改进，极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%。

Conclusion: xTime框架通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制，有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，现有数据驱动方法在定位方面表现尚可，但在重建接收信号强度场方面表现不佳，主要受限于空间上下文信息不足。

Method: 采用混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，将物理路径损耗模型与卷积神经网络通过对数线性池化融合。物理专家确保物理一致性，CNN利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应，使用拉普拉斯近似的贝叶斯推理提供后验不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功融合了物理模型和数据驱动方法，在GNSS干扰源定位和信号强度场重建方面表现出色，并能提供有意义的空间不确定性估计。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Conclusion: GRACE框架通过结构化学习和无偏元图方法有效解决了成瘾数据集中的类别不平衡问题，显著提升了少数类别的预测性能。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法存在两个问题：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽然能泛化但难以实时应用。两者都依赖耗能的人工神经网络，难以集成到资源受限的真实系统中。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接将分箱的脉冲投影到共享潜在空间中，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Conclusion: Spikachu引入了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗降低数个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究通过数据驱动方法优化约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具，结合电子健康记录数据，使用约束评分优化模型显著提升了跌倒风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动建模方法，将约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具的预测结果与更多临床意义指标进行更好对齐，改进住院患者跌倒预防协议。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与当前JHFRAT和XGBoost基准模型进行比较。

Result: 约束评分优化模型显著优于当前JHFRAT（AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 0.86），且在有/无EHR变量时表现相似。虽然XGBoost性能更优（AUC-ROC=0.94），但CSO模型对风险标签变化更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可使用数据驱动优化技术系统性地增强住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全，改善风险评估和资源配置。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: 本文为具有高斯边际分布的Thompson采样在强化学习中的理论分析，建立了后悔界为$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$K$为回合数，$H$为时间跨度，$\Gamma(\cdot)$表示高斯过程模型的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson采样在序列决策中应用广泛，但在强化学习等具有复杂时间结构的场景中，其理论基础仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白，为具有高斯边际分布的Thompson采样建立理论保证。

Method: 使用具有联合高斯过程先验的Thompson采样，考虑奖励和状态转移的高斯过程模型，分析非高斯价值函数和贝尔曼更新的递归结构，并将椭圆势引理扩展到多输出设置。

Result: 证明了在回合制强化学习中，Thompson采样的后悔界为$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$\Gamma(\cdot)$捕获高斯过程模型的复杂度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中理论理解，强调了结构假设和模型不确定性如何影响其在有限时间马尔可夫决策过程中的性能。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了利用隐藏世界的潜力，因为许多挑战仅通过表面观察无法解决，无论计算或数据规模如何。

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据通常稀缺，高通量记录技术难以应用，这对深度学习解码技术构成挑战。

Method: 使用神经元特异性最兴奋输入(MEIs)、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，构建生物启发的解码方法。

Result: 在从V1单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和少于1,000个训练数据点即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了Transformer模型在象棋任务中的推理能力，发现模型能够进行组合泛化，在分布外场景中仍能遵循游戏规则并生成高质量走法，但在复杂变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>

Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试模型在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统性泛化能力。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在精心设计的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960等变体游戏，同时分析训练动态。

Result: 模型展现出组合泛化能力，在分布外情况下仍能选择有效走法；在Chess960中虽能进行基本策略适应，但不如执行显式搜索的符号AI算法；训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本规则并展现出组合理解能力，但在需要深度推理的复杂变体中仍落后于传统符号AI方法，表明当前模型在系统性泛化方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了传统观点，证明在强化学习中，反向/正向KL散度的选择不决定模式覆盖，而是决定最优目标分布的参数化形式。模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励与参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为优化反向KL散度导致"模式寻找"，优化正向KL导致"质量覆盖"，后者在需要从多个多样化模式采样时更受青睐。但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习正则化中不一定成立。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，揭示了反向/正向KL选择决定最优目标分布族，而模式覆盖取决于其他因素。基于这些洞察构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法。

Result: 该算法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中，无需外部多样性信号，就能提高解决方案的质量和多样性，且同时适用于正向和反向KL。

Conclusion: 模式覆盖不取决于KL散度的方向选择，而主要受正则化强度、奖励与参考概率相对尺度等因素影响。提出的算法能有效提升模型输出的多样性和质量。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在集中市场中评估政策边际效应的方法，通过构建均衡调整结果来识别边际政策效应，无需政策规则的变化数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集中市场中政策评估问题，旨在非参数识别任何边际改革的总体影响，而无需额外的政策规则变化数据。

Method: 构建均衡调整结果——一个政策不变的结构对象，将个体结果与其参与对他人施加的完全均衡外部性相结合。使用实证工作中常见的估计量来构建这些外部性。

Result: 边际政策效应被识别为结构结果与改革方向之间的协方差，为最优政策目标提供了灵活工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为集中市场中的政策评估提供了新的识别框架，并与边际处理效应文献建立了桥梁。

Abstract: We study a policy evaluation problem in centralized markets. We show that the
aggregate impact of any marginal reform, the Marginal Policy Effect (MPE), is
nonparametrically identified using data from a baseline equilibrium, without
additional variation in the policy rule. We achieve this by constructing the
equilibrium-adjusted outcome: a policy-invariant structural object that
augments an agent's outcome with the full equilibrium externality their
participation imposes on others. We show that these externalities can be
constructed using estimands that are already common in empirical work. The MPE
is identified as the covariance between our structural outcome and the reform's
direction, providing a flexible tool for optimal policy targeting and a novel
bridge to the Marginal Treatment Effects literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释家庭消费行为中两个令人困惑的经验模式：失业家庭中低流动资产者的边际消费倾向更高，以及有过失业经历的家庭消费水平持续较低，这些现象无法用标准理性预期假设充分解释。

Method: 开发了一个模型，其中代理人使用带有神经网络近似的Q学习，在收入不确定性下做出消费储蓄决策，偏离了标准理性预期假设。

Conclusion: 强化学习机制通过价值函数近似误差提供了一个统一框架，解释过去经历如何影响当前消费行为，超越了当前经济条件的预测能力。

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling
empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns.
I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation
to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from
standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key
findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low
liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume
(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs
0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with
Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment
experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling
for current economic conditions, a "scarring" effect documented by Malmendier
and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about
income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism
generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through
value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation
results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive
learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for
understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond
what current economic conditions would predict.
