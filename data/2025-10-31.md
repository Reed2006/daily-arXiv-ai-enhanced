### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了StreetMath基准来评估LLM在现实近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLM在需要近似计算时仍倾向于精确计算或调用外部工具，且近似与精确计算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算上的表现，但对其在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探测其内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在需要近似计算的任务中仍试图计算精确值或调用外部工具；虽然有时能在早期层或步骤得到正确答案，但仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLM在街算场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，近似推理能力有待提升。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的情感分析方法，能够对实体评论进行细粒度情感强度分类（非常弱、弱、中等、强、非常强），并基于此对实体进行排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑情感强度的差异，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、微弱等不同级别的积极或消极情感。

Method: 结合副词、形容词、名词和动词等意见词，使用模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同强度类别，并通过句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系，计算实体在特定方面的得分。

Result: 该方法能够对实体评论进行更细粒度的情感强度分析，实现对实体的排名。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地分析情感强度，为基于情感分析的实体排名提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了LASTIST数据集，这是一个包含563,299个标注韩语句子的大规模目标无关立场检测数据集，填补了韩语立场检测研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型，特别是在立场检测这一新兴领域。

Method: 从韩国政党的新闻稿中收集数据，构建了LASTIST数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: 成功创建了包含563,299个标注韩语句子的大规模数据集，支持目标无关立场检测和历时演化立场检测等多种任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，有助于推动低资源语言中立场检测模型的发展。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA零延迟融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了LLM任务特定适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM部署任务特定适配器时，虽然适配器参数很少（通常小于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的巨大计算开销（可达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B参数的LLM上，zFLoRA在18个不同任务（常识推理、数学推理、摘要对话）中表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。在NPU和GPU平台上均实现零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种高效的适配器方法，能在保持性能的同时消除推理延迟，适用于多下游应用的LLM部署场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了三个改进电路发现的方法：使用自助法识别一致归因分数的边、引入基于比率的策略选择强正分数边、用整数线性规划替代贪心选择，在多个任务和模型上表现优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机制可解释性中电路发现的主要挑战，即确定模型的哪些部分执行给定任务。

Method: 1. 使用自助法识别具有一致归因分数的边；2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先考虑强正分数边；3. 用整数线性规划替代标准贪心选择。

Result: 方法产生了更忠实的电路，在多个MIB任务和模型上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 提出的三个改进方法有效提升了电路发现的性能和忠实度。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN框架使用LLM作为零样本偏好预测器，通过自然语言指导专家在多目标决策中选择最优选项，包含参数化方法LISTEN-U和非参数化方法LISTEN-T。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专家在多目标决策中难以形式化复杂偏好的问题，降低传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Method: 提出LISTEN-U（使用LLM优化参数化效用函数）和LISTEN-T（基于锦标赛选择的小批量非参数方法）两种迭代算法。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等任务中，LISTEN-U在参数对齐偏好下表现优异，LISTEN-T提供更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 探索了使用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，为偏好获取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter是一个用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选框架，通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异，识别需要长距离依赖的样本，从而提高训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分内容仅需局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据。

Method: LongFilter通过测量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异，识别那些长距离依赖至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架能够有效筛选适合长上下文预训练的数据，提高训练效率并在多个基准测试上表现出色。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索在临床问答中实现了比传统向量检索更好的性能（F1 0.90 vs 0.86），同时减少70%以上的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR中的临床文档以base64编码附件存储，传统向量检索方法难以捕捉细微的临床关系，需要更有效的检索方法。

Method: 开发了临床笔记QA评估平台，将CLEAR与零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成进行比较，测试了12个10,000-65,000token的临床笔记。

Result: CLEAR获得58.3%胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理减少78%token使用。在超过65,000token的长文档中胜率达75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，评估框架为临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的自动化和半自动化方法，发现半自动标注在帧多样性和标注覆盖率方面表现最佳，而全自动标注除标注时间外其他指标均较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中替代人工劳动已成为现实，但对其在标注数据集创建中的性能和影响，特别是从NLP视角的全面评估仍然缺乏。

Method: 通过比较三种实验设置（人工标注、自动标注和半自动标注）的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性来评估LLM语义角色标注器的性能。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了帧多样性并保持了相似的标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 混合的半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中表现最优，既能提高效率又能保持标注质量，而完全自动化方法在质量方面仍有不足。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一种代理管道，通过反馈驱动循环从LLM中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括检测和绕过对齐拒绝的模块，显著提高了受版权文本提取的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，需要一种方法来验证模型是否见过特定内容，最有力的证据是模型自由重现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，比较输出与参考段落并识别差异，然后将差异转化为最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成，还包括检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试中，RECAP相比单次迭代方法显著提升性能，GPT-4.1的受版权文本提取平均ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱机制显著提高了提取效果，为验证模型训练数据提供了有效方法。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言数据混合训练不会降低模型性能，挑战了多语言诅咒的假设，表明适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强模型能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间的权衡问题

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLM，在25到400种语言的不同多语言语料库上进行实验，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用

Result: 英语和多语言数据结合不会降低性能；英语作为枢纽语言对所有语系都有益；未观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不会损害性能，即使在低资源环境下也是如此

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译中的文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，即使使用现代大语言模型也会放大这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保存的影响，因为文化差异可能导致翻译过程中标签漂移或改变。

Method: 通过一系列跨文化敏感和中性领域的实验，比较不同机器翻译系统（包括统计MT和LLMs）在文化相似/不相似语言对中的表现。

Result: 发现：(1) MT系统（包括LLMs）在翻译中诱导标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2) LLMs编码文化知识，利用这些知识会放大标签漂移；(3) 源语言和目标语言之间的文化相似性是标签保存的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 在机器翻译中忽视文化因素不仅会削弱标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成方法会产生未经验证和算术上不可靠的解决方案，现有提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号计算引擎实现确定性验证。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，且token效率更高。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎上，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步，将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器设计了高性能矩阵乘法内核，通过内核融合和缓存策略优化，在LLM推理中实现了比AWS现有实现平均1.66倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为LLM训练和推理提供了有吸引力的异构架构方案，但由于其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求，实现高性能具有挑战性。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，针对Trainium架构定制了一系列技术，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示：矩阵乘法内核层面平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了Trainium上LLM推理的性能，证明了针对特定AI加速器架构定制优化策略的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AttnCache框架，通过检索和重用相似注意力图来加速LLM推理的prefill阶段，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2x和1.6x的端到端加速，注意力计算速度提升2-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载仅依赖prefill阶段推理，其中自注意力计算因二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。观察到语义不同的句子在不同层和头中产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理过程中识别和重用预缓存的注意力图，减少自注意力计算开销。

Result: 在CPU上平均实现1.2x端到端和2x注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6x端到端和3x注意力加速，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AttnCache能有效加速LLM的prefill阶段推理，通过重用相似注意力图显著降低计算开销，为仅依赖prefill的应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，通过内部推理独白和基于专家动作相似性的逐步奖励，解决小规模开源模型在多步推理中的学习困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理问题上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，强化学习在正确解很少被采样时失败，而监督微调则容易通过逐词模仿对长演示过拟合。

Method: SRL框架将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白，基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供逐步奖励。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习SFT或RLVR之前无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强性能。SRL在代理软件工程任务中也有效泛化。

Conclusion: SRL是一个稳健且多功能的面向推理的LLM训练框架，能够有效解决小模型在多步推理中的学习困难。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool是一种强化学习方法，通过鼓励工具使用LLM探索多种正确答案的轨迹来解决静态数据集训练的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法在动态环境中探索多种解决方案，导致性能受限。

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1）为给定查询生成多个rollout形成树状结构；2）基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力分配步骤奖励；3）使用分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练LLM。

Result: 实验使用17种工具处理用户查询，覆盖时间敏感和非敏感主题。PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量上显著优于其他训练方法。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能，能够探索多种解决方案路径。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了跨语言对齐(CLA)中的文化擦除问题，提出了转移-本地化平面评估框架，发现现有方法在提升事实转移的同时会损害文化本地化，并提出基于层特异性激活引导的外科手术式引导方法来解决这一权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐虽然能促进多语言表示对齐，但可能导致文化擦除——即模型无法根据不同查询语言提供文化情境化响应。本文旨在系统分析这一权衡关系。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架量化知识转移和文化擦除；分析模型内部表示发现事实转移和文化知识在不同层最优可引导；提出外科手术式引导方法，在推理时对不同层应用针对性激活引导。

Result: 对六种语言的评估显示，现有CLA方法在提升事实转移的同时会损害文化本地化；提出的外科手术式引导方法能更好地平衡这两个竞争维度。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐存在事实转移与文化本地化的根本权衡，通过层特异性的激活引导可以有效解决这一矛盾，为多语言模型发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于自然语言处理的工具来识别放射学报告中的偶然甲状腺发现，发现这些发现很常见且与甲状腺癌过度诊断相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着影像学检查的普及，偶然甲状腺发现的检测频率增加，但其流行率、特征和临床后果尚不明确。

Method: 使用基于transformer的自然语言处理流程，从2017-2023年梅奥诊所多个影像学检查报告中识别偶然甲状腺发现并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有偶然甲状腺发现，其中92.9%为结节。这些发现与更高的甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断几率相关。

Conclusion: 偶然甲状腺发现很常见，且与导致检测出小型低风险癌症的连锁反应密切相关，强调了其在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用以及标准化报告和更有选择性随访的必要性。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

TL;DR: 提出了QCoder Benchmark评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在量子编程任务上的表现，支持量子模拟器环境和真实人类代码对比分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）的应用研究不足，需要专门的评估框架来测试模型生成量子代码的能力。

Method: 开发了QCoder Benchmark评估框架，包含两个关键特性：1）支持量子模拟器环境评估，提供电路深度、执行时间等域特定指标反馈；2）整合真实编程竞赛中的人类代码提交，用于定量和定性分析。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在量子编程任务上仅达到18.97%的准确率，而基于推理的模型如o3能达到78%的准确率，超过了人类代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 量子编程对大语言模型具有挑战性，推理模型表现优于传统模型，QCoder Benchmark为相关研究提供了有效的评估工具和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出1PNS训练范式，通过引入推理路径差异度量RPD来增加模型输出的多样性，相比传统的1P1S训练显著提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"一个问题，一个答案"（1P1S）训练导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展（TTS）的效果。

Method: 提出"一个问题，多个解法"（1PNS）训练范式，引入推理路径差异（RPD）度量来选择和训练具有最大多样性的思维链解法。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base上的实验显示，RPD选择的训练数据产生了更多样化的输出，pass@16平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式通过增加推理路径的多样性，进一步放大了测试时扩展的有效性。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和话语关系的数据集，研究者希望探索这两者之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息，增进对有效沟通的理解。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集作为基础，开发了基于LLM的分类器，评估了4个LLM和10种提示，创建了40个话语关系分类器，并通过多数投票策略构建了5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析了银数据集，发现六种话语关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中起关键作用，特别是在使用情感化语言、夸张/弱化、重复和制造怀疑时。

Conclusion: 话语关系在说服技巧中扮演重要角色，这一发现有助于检测网络宣传和错误信息，并增进对有效沟通机制的理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了表达能力。需要一种能模拟多头注意力机制的高效架构。

Method: 使用混合专家(MoE)实现，不仅在通道混合MLP块中，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个"注意力头"，模拟线性多头注意力。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中，MossNet优于类似模型大小和数据预算的transformer和SSM架构。更大变体在万亿token训练中确认了可扩展性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MossNet是高效、高性能循环LLM架构的一个有前景的新方向，在真实设备上表现出良好的运行速度和资源使用效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中存在较高的弃权率（abstentions），导致统计效率低下。需要开发一种方法能够减少弃权率，提高模型在指令遵循任务中的表现。

Method: 使用监督微调将预训练解码器Transformer模型转换为SDM模型，在训练过程中使用最终层SDM激活层估计基变换，通过对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负例来优化监督下一个token损失。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM模型显著减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能够有效提高预训练语言模型在指令遵循任务中的性能，通过特定的激活层设计和训练策略实现了更好的校准和高概率区域生成。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格，引入跨响应相似性(CRS)方法来测量风格自一致性，并在十个LLM和四个推理基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一种评估指令鲁棒性的原则性方法，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有效代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际应用中存在更新遗忘问题，即均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期的语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)，通过为每个token分配时间步调度来实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。该方法可在推理时应用，支持固定策略或自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高20%以上，困惑度几乎减半，且仅使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释的特征来理解偏好数据的编码内容，揭示不同数据集中的偏好差异和潜在安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测和不良的方式改变语言模型，但从业者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。需要自动提取相关特征而不预先指定假设的方法。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，既能表征数据集能够测量的偏好，也能表征注释者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集中，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释的特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。揭示了人类偏好的广泛多样性，发现数据集上下文的作用，以及潜在的不安全偏好。

Conclusion: WIMHF为从业者提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，以更好地理解和使用偏好数据，支持有效的数据筛选和细粒度的个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来显著提升全局检索增强生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（从少量文档中检索相关片段），但现实应用需要全局RAG能力——跨整个文档集合聚合信息以获取语料级洞察。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器去除噪声文档，并包含用于精确符号计算的聚合模块。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，相比最强基线的1.51 F1有显著提升。

Conclusion: 现有RAG方法在全局任务上表现不佳，而GlobalRAG框架通过多工具协作显著提升了全局RAG能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过将语用学理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以显著提升其在理解隐含意义任务上的表现，最高可提升9.6%的分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含意义在人类交流和语言使用中至关重要，语言模型也需要具备这种能力。

Method: 提出将语用学理论（如格莱斯语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示，引导语言模型通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理的基线方法，该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上得分最高提升9.6%。仅提及语用学理论名称也能在较大模型中带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，能显著提升语言模型理解隐含意义的能力。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现预训练语言模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现不佳，尽管有明确的指令和上下文信息，模型仍然难以准确识别借词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类识别借词的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续向少数语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了多个预训练语言模型在10种语言上的表现，使用明确的指令和上下文信息进行借词识别任务。

Result: 模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现很差，这证实了现代NLP系统对借词而非原生等价词存在偏见。

Conclusion: 这项研究对开发少数语言的NLP工具以及在主导语言词汇压力下支持语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究分析了五种知识蒸馏方法在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中的表现，发现某些配置能在模型大小减半的情况下保持甚至提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但存在设计敏感的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多语言环境下表现不均衡，模型压缩时问题更严重。知识蒸馏在模型压缩中效果显著，但在多语言场景下的应用研究不足。

Method: 对CLIP和SigLIP2模型采用五种知识蒸馏方法，评估其在域内检索和域外视觉问答任务中的表现，重点关注跨语言表示一致性和下游性能稳定性。

Result: 研究发现某些蒸馏配置能在模型大小减半时保持或提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法反映的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有潜力，但需要仔细选择蒸馏方法以避免跨任务性能下降，仅关注整体准确率不足以评估模型的实际表现。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，利用神经元激活的内部信号进行无监督集成解码，通过激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来选择最佳候选答案，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确回答激活的神经元更少且更一致。

Method: NAD方法基于神经元激活分析：1）计算激活稀疏性（正确回答激活更少神经元）；2）评估跨样本神经元一致性（正确回答激活模式更一致）。该方法无需文本输出比较，支持早期预测和提前停止。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中，NAD与多数投票方法相当；在开放式编码基准测试中，NAD持续优于Avg@64方法。通过早期修剪无效轨迹，NAD减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部神经元激活信号为无监督集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，展示了内部行为分析在提升LLM推理性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLM在数字输入嵌入表示准确性与实际输出错误之间的冲突，探索语言模型如何操作数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Method: 分析不同语言模型的数字表示，创建通用探针来追踪信息（包括输出错误原因）到特定层。

Result: 发现尽管存在表面错误，但不同LLM学习到了可互换、系统化且高度准确的数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中具有普遍性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLM如何操作数字提供了基本理解，并指出了更准确的探针技术在改进LLM架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ChatGPT Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出色，但其在动态交互环境中的能力尚未充分探索，因此使用浏览器游戏作为测试场景进行早期评估。

Method: 使用Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world等浏览器游戏作为测试场景，以游戏内表现分数作为量化指标评估不同任务类型的性能。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，经常无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: Atlas展现出强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在显著局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署面临的三大挑战：隐私担忧、有限计算资源和需要教学有效反馈，要求能在本地运行的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具和自我反思推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型高效模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在需要深度原理性理解的专业领域（如经济学、心理学）表现不佳，存在关键领域差距

Method: ACER首先为特定学科生成目录结构，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问题-答案对，构建系统性的课程内容，采用交错课程安排进行持续预训练

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在微观经济学等挑战性领域提升准确率5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，非目标领域也有0.7点的知识迁移提升，在ARC和GPQA基准上提升超过2个绝对点

Conclusion: ACER提供了一个可扩展且有效的方法来缩小大语言模型在关键专业领域的性能差距，同时保持通用推理能力的稳定性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Motivation: 健康相关谬误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些歪曲科学发现的论点难以识别，需要有效方法来检测这类谬误。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)生成合成谬误样本，然后对大型语言模型进行轻量级微调，利用MISSCI数据集和框架进行训练。

Conclusion: 通过合成谬误数据增强有限的标注资源，可以显著提升LLM在真实世界科学谬误信息分类任务中的零样本性能，即使计算资源有限也能实现。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Motivation: 多智能体方法虽然有望超越单一模型能力，但成功依赖于协同的团队组成。由于大多数模型的不透明性，难以了解其内部特征以进行有效协作。

Method: 构建'语言模型图'来映射模型间关系，基于成对对话的语义连贯性，然后应用社区检测来识别协同模型集群。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型群组，反映其潜在专业化。在特定话题引导下，识别的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专业化的手动构建团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用中面临显著挑战，现有模型在知识掌握和素养培养方面都有很大改进空间。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可实现50%压缩且性能不下降，获得1.63倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然语言理解能力出色，但部署面临巨大带宽和计算需求。现有方法如剪枝和低秩逼近各自表现良好，但两者的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，利用低秩逼近保留模型核心结构，稀疏优化去除非关键权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练就超越单独方法，达到最先进结果。Qwen2.5压缩50%性能不降，至少1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效部署LLM提供了实用解决方案，通过协同稀疏和低秩压缩实现优异的压缩效率和性能保持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个贝叶斯网络LLM融合框架，通过概率机制整合三个LLM的预测结果，用于情感分析，在三个金融语料库上实现了约6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域特定LLM缺乏透明度、微调成本高、提示工程需求大、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境影响等问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络进行后期融合，将多个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点，整合FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个模型的预测结果。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人类标注金融语料库上评估，相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率一致提升。

Conclusion: 该框架对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，概率融合方法在可解释情感分类中有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了使用多个开源LLM模型组成的集成系统来评估AI分诊工具的性能，发现LLM集成比单一LLM提供更可靠的地面真值评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否比单一LLM能更可靠地评估基于像素的AI分诊工具。

Method: 分析29,766例非增强CT头部检查的放射学报告，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o组成的集成系统，通过多示例提示评估颅内出血存在情况。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳(AUC=0.78)，LLM集成在MCC指标上优于单一GPT4o，且集成之间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM集成提供了比单一LLM更一致可靠的方法来评估临床AI分诊工具。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: CORE-KG框架通过消融研究量化其核心组件贡献：去除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；去除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律文书中知识图谱构建面临的挑战，包括非结构化、词汇密集、指代模糊等问题，以及现有LLM方法产生的噪声和碎片化图谱。

Method: 使用CORE-KG框架，集成了类型感知共指消解模块和领域引导的结构化提示，通过消融研究分析各组件贡献。

Result: 核心消解对减少节点重复贡献更大（28.32% vs 4.34%），而结构化提示对减少噪声节点更关键（73.33% vs 4.32%）。

Conclusion: 为从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的LLM管道设计提供了实证见解，强调了共指消解和结构化提示的重要性。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

TL;DR: DIVRIT是一个新颖的希伯来语变音符号恢复系统，将任务构建为零样本分类问题，使用希伯来语视觉语言模型处理未变音文本图像，在候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语未变音文本存在高度歧义性，影响发音准确性和文本含义理解，需要开发有效的自动变音符号恢复方法。

Method: 将变音符号恢复构建为零样本分类问题，使用希伯来语视觉语言模型处理未变音文本图像，基于上下文从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在正确变音形式保证在候选集中的"oracle"设置下，系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示方法在希伯来语自动变音符号恢复方面具有巨大潜力，能够在不依赖复杂显式语言分析的情况下有效执行变音任务。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的结构，发现它们不是编码特定关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，这解释了其高度可压缩性和泛化局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现到关系集合，系统研究线性关系解码器的组织结构，解释其高压缩性和泛化模式。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议分析解码器间的语义重叠。

Result: 线性关系解码器高度可压缩，它们提取的是重复的语义属性而非特定关系，这解释了其压缩性和泛化模式。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码主要是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这澄清了其压缩性和泛化特性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: InfoFlow框架通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三个方法，解决了深度搜索中奖励密度低的问题，显著提升了强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度搜索场景中奖励密度低，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR（带可验证奖励的强化学习）的应用。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用双智能体架构减轻深度探索的认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能体搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性地提高奖励密度，有效解决了深度搜索中的探索效率问题，为轻量级模型提供了与大型模型竞争的能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因自回归设计和模型规模导致的推理延迟问题，现有方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构改进推测解码，但忽略了GPU设备和批大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批大小等因素），动态优化树结构。

Result: 在6个不同任务和6个不同LLM上的综合实验表明，该方法相比传统解码方法加速最高达5.2倍，通常比现有最优技术提升5%-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量动态优化树结构，在推测解码中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页面视觉文档时，特别是在元素和页面级别的细粒度推理方面存在困难，而大语言模型在文档理解方面提供了新的机会。

Method: 使用专业化代理将推理分解为三个层次：全局、页面和元素，构建结构化的、查询无关的表征，在推理时选择性激活这些代理并整合输出。

Result: 在广泛实验中，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架能够有效理解多页面视觉文档，捕捉整体主题和细节视觉/文本线索，生成连贯、上下文感知的答案。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的LLM，发现经过现代训练方法增强后，RedLLM在性能、推理效率和上下文长度外推方面表现出色，甚至在某些任务上优于主流的仅解码器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从扩展角度对编码器-解码器模型的严谨比较，可能低估了其潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，采用来自仅解码器LLM的最新训练方法，在150M到8B参数规模上进行全面比较，使用RedPajama V1进行预训练和FLAN进行指令调优。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的扩展特性，在指令调优后在下游任务上达到可比甚至更好的结果，同时享有显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器LLM具有被低估的潜力，值得重新审视以开发更强大和高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中显示出有效性、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较中超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现出色。核心创新是Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)，通过更细粒度的门控机制增强有限状态RNN内存的有效利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的计算效率问题，同时保持或超越全注意力模型的性能表现，特别是在需要处理超长上下文的场景中。

Method: 采用KDA线性注意力模块，结合Gated DeltaNet和精细门控机制；使用专门的块状算法和Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) 过渡矩阵变体提高硬件效率；构建3B激活参数、48B总参数的混合架构，结合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)。

Result: 在相同训练方案下，Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中显著超越全MLA模型，KV缓存使用减少高达75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍，在长输入输出任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可以作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别是在处理长上下文场景时具有明显优势。开源实现和预训练模型支持进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model

Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签存在误导性，实际上依赖非可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数，这过程繁琐且不高效。

Method: 在标准transformer架构上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过"黑客测试集"获得的oracle调优基线相当的性能，这是任何静态方法的实际上限。

Conclusion: AutoDeco实现了真正的端到端生成，并发现了基于指令的解码控制能力，模型能够理解自然语言指令并相应调整解码参数，为可引导和交互式LLM解码开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在训练过程中如何学习人类价值观对齐，发现监督微调阶段主要建立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐价值观，不同偏好优化算法会导致不同的对齐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注完全训练后模型的价值观对齐，忽略了模型学习表达人类价值观的训练动态过程，需要研究价值观对齐在训练过程中何时及如何产生。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，通过合成偏好数据集控制价值观操作，分析训练过程中的价值观漂移。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常建立模型的价值观基础，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观；即使偏好数据相同，不同偏好优化算法也会导致不同的价值观对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解价值观在训练过程中的学习机制提供了可操作的见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择模型和偏好优化算法来改进模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级LLMs的评估效果下降，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动数学推理能力的发展。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案而非证明，实现自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验结果显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但显示出随着测试时计算量增加的良好扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench突显了当前LLMs在数学推理方面的显著改进空间，为推进语言模型推理能力研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中部署增多，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估方法。

Method: 提出Gistify任务：给定完整代码库和特定入口点，要求编码LLM生成最小自包含文件来复现相同功能输出。

Result: 当前最先进模型在Gistify任务上表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务能有效评估编码LLM对代码库的结构理解、执行流建模和大型代码补丁生成能力。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知器(MLPs)的有前景替代方案，具有更强的表达能力和可解释性，但相关研究分散且缺乏系统整理，需要全面综述来指导后续研究。

Method: 通过收集和分类大量开源实现，系统分析KANs的理论基础、架构变体和实现策略，包括基函数选择、精度提升技术、效率优化和正则化方法。

Result: 建立了KANs与MLPs的形式等价性，展示了KANs在参数效率方面的优势，并提供了基函数选择的权衡分析以及架构选择的实用指南。

Conclusion: KANs在表达能力和可解释性方面具有显著优势，本文为研究者提供了结构化参考，并指出了当前研究空白，相关GitHub仓库支持持续研究。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

TL;DR: HiMAE是一个分层掩码自编码器框架，通过多分辨率嵌入系统评估可穿戴传感器数据中不同时间尺度的预测信号，在分类、回归和生成任务中优于现有方法，并能在智能手表上实现边缘推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生大量生理时间序列数据，但其预测效用的基本原则尚不明确。作者假设时间分辨率是表征学习的基本维度，不同的临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的时间结构。

Method: 提出HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器）框架，结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器，生成多分辨率嵌入，将分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于那些压缩尺度的最先进基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级。HiMAE足够紧凑，可在智能手表上完全运行，在智能手表级CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是一种高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super
explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

Motivation: 理解模型如何学习遵循思维链监督并从中受益的机制，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 通过在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，控制任务复杂度和数据组成，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT轨迹两种训练设置。

Result: CoT通常能提升任务性能，但其效果取决于任务复杂度；模型在训练早期会出现推理轨迹与答案不一致的现象；CoT改变了Transformer的内部计算机制。

Conclusion: CoT监督加速了泛化过程，但无法解决高算法复杂度的任务；推理轨迹的忠实性是一个动态发展的特性；提出了理解Transformer学习的动力学建模框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习的价值，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习的量化指导，ABLOC算法能够保证收敛到理论性能界限。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Conclusion: 基于模拟强化学习的非短视决策框架能显著提升拼车系统性能，为运营商带来显著成本节约，但再平衡操作会增加车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态（视觉或语言），忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含用于跨模态证据检索的双外部记忆和双LoRA适配器，以及选择性激活的脑启发知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前编辑内容。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs中的持续组合知识编辑设立了新的基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Result: 发现几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象。大量实验证明FreLE具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解这一问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统基于SFT的冷启动方法存在指令风格过拟合问题，削弱了分布外泛化能力，影响下游强化学习效果。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练，专注于浅层、可迁移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果传递给具有可验证奖励的RL进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，MEGA-Bench提升4.1%，MathVista提升12.2%，同时减少分布内"卡顿"、改善探索、稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: SPECS框架通过解耦多模态学习，证明了偏好训练方法在冷启动中优于SFT方法，为强化学习提供了更好的初始化策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

TL;DR: 提出MoE-POT模型，一种稀疏激活的专家混合预训练架构，用于解决PDE问题中的数据集异构性和推理成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDE数据集中方程类型异构性导致的混合训练高误差问题，以及密集预训练模型推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用分层路由门控网络，在推理时从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕获PDE的通用特性。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数的模型，90M激活参数的模型比现有120M激活参数模型的零样本误差降低达40%。

Conclusion: MoE架构通过路由门控网络决策可以推断数据集类型，验证了该架构的合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个利用软提示预映像结构优化黑盒大语言模型指令的框架，通过分数共享、预映像初始化和分数一致性正则化，在相同查询预算下实现更高效的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLM指令优化中，白盒LLM常将不同软提示映射到相同指令，导致冗余查询。传统方法视此多对一映射为优化效率障碍，本文将其重新解释为可加速优化的先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：1) 分数共享 - 在预映像内共享评估分数；2) 预映像初始化 - 基于预映像信息选择最大化搜索空间覆盖的初始数据点；3) 分数一致性正则化 - 在每个预映像内强制执行预测一致性。

Result: PRESTO在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍以上的评分数据，在33个指令优化任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用预映像结构，PRESTO能够更高效地优化黑盒LLM的指令，证明了多对一映射结构可作为有用的先验知识来加速优化过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个无需训练的高效框架，通过Neighborhood Patch Attention减少计算冗余，结合Latent Frequency Mixing和Structure Guidance，在U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上实现高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在超出训练分辨率时性能下降的问题，现有无需训练方法计算量大且与Diffusion Transformer不兼容。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention减少自注意力层计算冗余，集成到SDEdit流程中，引入Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，应用Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: 在无需训练方法中达到最先进的图像质量和推理速度，适用于U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，成功扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率而无需额外训练。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MedVLSynther框架，从开放生物医学文献中合成高质量的多选题VQA数据，并创建了MedSynVQA数据集，训练的开源大模型在多个医学VQA基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用医学VQA系统面临高质量开放数据集的缺乏问题，需要开发能够从开放文献中合成高质量训练数据的方法。

Method: 采用生成器-验证器框架：生成器基于图像、标题和文本引用生成多选题，验证器通过多阶段验证确保问题质量，包括自包含性、单一正确答案、临床有效性和图文一致性。

Result: 从PubMed Central创建了包含13,087个问题和14,803张图像的MedSynVQA数据集，涵盖13种成像模态和28个解剖区域。训练的开源模型在6个医学VQA基准上达到平均55.85(3B)和58.15(7B)的准确率，在VQA-RAD和PathVQA上分别达到77.57和67.76。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供了一条可审计、可复现且保护隐私的路径，用于扩展医学VQA训练数据，验证了生成和验证两个环节的必要性，更多验证数据持续带来性能提升。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了π_RL框架，用于在并行仿真中训练基于流的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过两种强化学习算法解决迭代去噪过程中动作对数似然难以计算的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探索使用强化学习来自动化监督微调的数据收集过程，但将大规模RL应用于基于流的VLA模型仍然具有挑战性，主要因为迭代去噪过程中的动作对数似然难以计算。

Method: π_RL框架实现两种RL算法：Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，使用可学习的噪声网络进行精确对数似然计算；Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，构建双层MDP，采用ODE到SDE转换实现高效RL探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，π_RL将少样本SFT模型π_0和π_0.5的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%。在ManiSkill中，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0从41.6%提升到85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升到84.8%，涵盖4352个拾取放置任务。

Conclusion: π_RL实现了显著的性能提升和更强的泛化能力，验证了在线强化学习对于基于流的VLA模型的有效性，展示了在异构仿真下可扩展的多任务RL能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在标签稀缺情况下主动学习中的探索与利用平衡问题，避免依赖手动调参的启发式方法。

Method: 使用平衡福尔曼曲率构建核心集选择初始标签，包含数据驱动的停止准则；动态触发探索到利用的转换；采用局部图重连策略整合多尺度信息。

Result: 在基准分类任务上，该方法在低标签率下持续优于现有的基于图的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 图拓扑方法能有效解决主动学习中的探索-利用平衡问题，在标签稀缺情况下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

Motivation: 解决多领域环境下因果效应估计的挑战，特别是存在未观测混杂因子且因果效应在不同领域间可能变化的情况。

Method: 使用代理变量方法，假设所有变量为离散或分类变量，提出两种估计技术并证明一致性，推导置信区间。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计目标领域的因果效应，即使在仅能观测到代理变量的情况下。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

TL;DR: 提出使用任务驱动的表示方法，在主动学习过程中定期更新表示，以处理混乱数据池中固定无监督表示失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时，依赖固定的无监督表示，这会削弱其有效性，因为这种表示可能无法捕捉与任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出两种学习任务驱动表示的策略：1）直接学习半监督表示；2）在初始无监督表示基础上进行监督微调。两种方法都在主动学习过程中使用已收集的标签定期更新表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，这两种方法在使用无监督或预训练表示的基础上，都显著提高了经验性能。

Conclusion: 任务驱动的表示方法能够有效改善主动学习在处理混乱数据池时的性能，通过定期更新表示来更好地捕捉任务相关信息。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvGNN-WM，一种基于图不变量的无触发器水印方法，用于保护图神经网络的知识产权。该方法通过模型对图代数连通性的隐式感知来验证所有权，在保持任务性能的同时提供黑盒验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要一种更鲁棒的水印机制。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特位，并采用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM在保持清洁精度的同时，比基于触发器和压缩的基线方法获得更高的水印精度。在非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化下保持强健，知识蒸馏会削弱水印但结合水印损失可恢复。

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM提供了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，证明了精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了有效的无触发器水印解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

Motivation: 传统哈希或one-hot编码无法保持双射映射，MLT旨在提供可逆、维度可控且计算可扩展的分类标识符编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现分类标识符到数值向量的可逆编码，支持显式维度控制和计算扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT与监督嵌入方法相比，预测性能相当，但参数更少、训练成本更低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效、可逆的分类标识符编码方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不完整的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据，比较Google人口动态基础模型、Google AlphaEarth卫星图像和移动电话CDR三种GeoFM嵌入源与传统地理插值方法的预测性能。

Result: 嵌入方法在15个指标中的13个上优于基线方法。多源GeoFM集成模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得较好预测效果，但对结核病和营养不良等数据稀缺目标的预测效果较差。

Conclusion: 多源GeoFM集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

Result: 虽然MLP几十年前已用于解决线性规划，但这种方法最近因在组合优化、逆问题和偏微分方程等多样化应用中展现出有前景的结果而受到越来越多的关注。

Conclusion: 本文阐明了数据无关神经网络设置与零样本学习、单样本学习、优化中的提升和过参数化等相关概念之间的相似性和区别。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管InfoNCE在对比表示学习中广泛使用，但其与互信息的间接联系使其不适合作为有效的MI估计器，需要开发更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当评分规则框架统一各种对比目标。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在log评分下获得最准确的MI估计，但在自监督表示学习中锚点并未提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的MI估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: 提出了PCN-TA（带时间摊销的预测编码网络），通过保持跨时间帧的潜在状态，利用时间相关性显著减少计算需求，同时保持学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘机器人系统需要高效的在线学习算法来持续适应变化的环境，传统反向传播在生物合理性方面存在不足，预测编码框架虽然具有生物合理性但计算开销大。

Method: 在预测编码网络基础上引入时间摊销机制，保留潜在状态跨时间帧，利用时间相关性减少计算需求。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA相比反向传播减少10%权重更新，相比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA在保持学习性能的同时显著降低计算开销，为边缘部署和实时适应提供了高效解决方案，其生物启发特性也适合神经形态硬件实现。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，用于解决线性bandit中探索频率不足的问题，在保持贪婪策略的同时按计划进行探索，实现高效且实用的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两极分化：完全自适应探索方法在每个时间步都探索，在安全关键或成本高昂的领域不实用；而纯贪婪策略在缺乏上下文多样性时会失败。需要一种中间方案。

Method: INFEX框架：按照给定计划执行基础探索策略，在计划之间主要选择贪婪动作。这是一个通用模块化框架，可以无缝集成任何完全自适应探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相匹配的实例相关遗憾。实证评估证实了理论发现，显示出最先进的遗憾性能和运行时改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的框架，通过限制密集探索计算到不频繁的间隔，既提高了计算效率，又保持了强大的学习性能，在安全关键和成本敏感领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性和时间动态风险预测，现有方法难以灵活整合这两个方面

Method: 双MoE框架：特征编码MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖C-index提升达0.04，整合到Consurv框架后获得进一步增益

Conclusion: 双MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活整合现有深度学习生存分析流程

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: 提出了三种改进去偏方法可蒸馏性的解决方案，为理解知识蒸馏工作机制和设计更好的去偏方法提供了见解

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端transformer管道和精心生成的训练数据，在五种不同模型大小和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行实验。

Result: 验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势，确定了计算最优的超参数扩展：最佳批大小和学习率随模型大小增长，token与参数比约为15是最优的。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能很大程度上可以从计算量预测，这为训练下一代符号回归模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数，限制了模型的表达能力。本文旨在通过动态优化模型空间的几何结构来获得更强的表达能力。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为'数据驱动几何'概念提供了优雅物理解释；证明了即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有显著更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态'元学习器'奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Motivation: 合成数据生成是解决敏感金融数据在机器学习应用中隐私风险和监管约束的可行方法，但缺乏对该领域研究现状的全面梳理。

Method: 系统综述方法，整理分析2018年以来发表的72项研究，分类研究金融信息类型、生成方法和评估策略。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

TL;DR: 提出了Nirvana模型，这是一种具有专门记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型。通过任务感知记忆触发器和专门记忆更新器，模型能够根据任务需求灵活调整记忆机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构（包括Transformer、线性注意力和混合模型）缺乏由任务信息引导的专门记忆机制。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够保持广泛能力同时在目标领域达到专家级性能的模型。

Method: 设计了任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专门记忆更新器（Updater）。Trigger根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务；Updater在Trigger引导下动态记忆上下文。

Result: 在多种自然语言建模基准测试中，Nirvana取得了与现有LLM结构相当或更优的结果。在具有挑战性的医学任务（MRI）上，Nirvana实现了比传统MRI模型和传统LLM骨干模型更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门的记忆机制成功实现了专业化通用模型的目标，在保持广泛能力的同时，在特定领域达到了专家级性能，证明了任务引导记忆机制的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的bug定位方法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、使用简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析。

Method: 设计了一个多阶段流水线，利用LLM：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率提高了38%以上，多阶段流水线相比基线LLM方法准确率提高了60%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段流水线对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

TL;DR: 提出两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，通过协调路由减少城市交通拥堵，在合成网格和真实城市地图上显著降低平均旅行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会加剧交通拥堵。需要开发能够协调多车辆路由、考虑网络状态的智能导航系统。

Method: AN使用分散式MARL，每个交叉口智能体基于本地交通和图注意力网络建模的邻域状态提供路由指导。HHAN扩展AN，只在关键枢纽部署智能体，采用集中训练分散执行框架，结合注意力机制协调异步车辆决策。

Result: AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率。HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 传统的机器学习评估方法基于测试集上的平均损失，这在地球科学中相当于将性能在地球上均匀平均，忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性。需要更细致的评估方法来了解模型在不同区域的性能差异。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按地理网格点的不同属性进行分层：领土（国家）、全球子区域、收入水平和土地覆盖（陆地或水域）。对每个属性层分别评估模型性能。

Result: 使用SAFE对多个最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在每个属性上都表现出预测技能的差异。建立了基于不同提前期和各种气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全球平均指标，首次能够回答模型在哪些地方表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平。SAFE工具包开源可用，支持该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法仅基于LLMs自身生成的响应进行训练，受限于LLMs的初始能力，容易陷入探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。

Method: LTE方法通过提示LLMs其先前自我生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，无需外部专家指导，有效缓解探索停滞。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试上，LTE相比GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external

outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WiFi CSI活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临的域偏移问题，即环境变化导致识别性能下降，同时保持隐私保护特性。

Method: 采用闭环视觉引导模型自适应框架，包含高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，在线微调轻量级CSI HAR模型STAR。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导自适应循环后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现了动态、自监督的模型自适应，为长期自主的CSI活动识别建立了可扩展的实用范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的增强对齐信号，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: 实验结果显示MolBridge能有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，在多个分子基准测试中优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而集成模型实现了AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内实现100%的早期检测。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时序不确定的数据场景中，模型简洁性结合优化分段可以超越更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，忽略了容量约束，需要更实用的协作分配方法。

Method: 将CPRA建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，设计GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明GSTRL具有优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为CPRA问题提供了理论基础和有效解决方案，在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法忽略跨训练周期的复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序，需要更精确的逐样本影响估计方法。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸设置中收紧误差界限；在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上，ACC-SGD-IE产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长周期训练中。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在数据清洗任务中更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用该方法清洗数据训练出的模型性能优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Motivation: 降低可预防的医院再入院率是医疗支付方、提供者和政策制定者的国家优先事项，用于提高医疗质量和降低成本。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机分析健康索赔数据，采用主成分分析进行降维，基于AUC指标评估模型性能。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Result: AISP在样本使用数量方面优于best-of-n采样，并且比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不进行微调的情况下优化模型输出质量。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法通常强调理论公式或优化目标，但在实际部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完整访问原始数据集和模型。本文旨在解决这些实际挑战。

Method: 将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，通过反转最后训练序列来实现遗忘。在模型末端添加投影重分布层，作为输出过滤器集成到现有分类流程中。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100使用CNN模型，Covertype使用树模型）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重新训练模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际环境中展示了适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能，为机器遗忘提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活空间中的向量来控制LLM的特定行为，相比现有方法更灵活稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的控制方法。

Method: Angular Steering方法通过在固定的二维子空间中旋转激活向量来实现行为调制，将控制问题转化为几何旋转问题。还提出了Adaptive Angular Steering变体，只旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 实验表明Angular Steering在多个模型家族和尺寸上都能实现鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering将现有的加法和正交化技术统一到几何旋转框架下，简化了参数选择，在更广泛的调整范围内保持模型稳定性，为安全可靠的AI部署提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we

### [109] [Understanding Hardness of Vision-Language Compositionality from A Token-level Causal Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26302)
*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构因果模型解释了CLIP在组合推理上的脆弱性，揭示了组合不可识别性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，表现为类似词袋匹配器的行为。现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，掩盖了token级结构，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列结构因果模型的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: token粒度分析首次从原理上解释了CLIP的组合脆弱性：组合不可识别性。存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，并显示迭代组合操作如何增加难度，为改进负例挖掘策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

### [110] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ2最大间隔分类器而非ℓ∞最大间隔分类器，而Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都保持ℓ∞最大间隔偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解有限。先前分析表明Adam偏向ℓ∞几何解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本研究旨在理解增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 构建结构化数据集证明增量Adam收敛到ℓ2最大间隔分类器；开发代理算法捕捉β2→1时增量Adam的极限行为；通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征收敛方向；比较Signum优化器的行为。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差偏离全批次行为，可能收敛到ℓ2最大间隔分类器；Signum在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞最大间隔分类器；Adam的偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的隐式偏差关键依赖于批次方案和数据集特性，而Signum优化器在这方面更具鲁棒性，为优化器选择提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关的持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了模型反演中的特征漂移和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私和安全约束下，存储和重放历史数据不可行，需要数据无关的持续学习方法来更新模型而不访问先前数据。

Method: 使用分层模型反演（PMI）提高计算效率，通过高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征来缓解特征漂移，结合语义感知投影特征生成伪图像。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中实现了强大的有效性和兼容性，显著减少了模型反演所需的迭代次数。

Conclusion: 提出的PMI和特征建模方法能够有效解决数据无关持续学习中的关键挑战，为大规模预训练模型的持续学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

*Sascha Mücke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用QUBO公式训练SVM，通过量子退火优化模型。研究发现低精度编码（如1比特/参数）即可获得与经典方法相当的分类性能，增加比特深度并不总能提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，研究量子比特数量（对应权重离散化程度）对预测性能的影响。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行优化，比较不同比特编码精度下的性能，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行对比。

Result: 低精度QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）能获得竞争性甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度允许使用更大的正则化参数，但不一定改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择正确的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要；随着量子设备规模扩大，量子退火在高效SVM训练方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的条件采样方法，能够在多项式时间内从后验分布中采样，仅需要分数误差的L^4界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决后验采样的计算难题，特别是在存在分数估计误差的情况下，为图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务提供准确公平的框架。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，利用L^4界约束分数误差，实现条件采样。

Result: 在多项式时间内实现了条件采样，相比传统方法对分数误差的要求更宽松（L^4界 vs 子指数界）。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验采样提供了一种计算可行的解决方案，扩展了扩散模型在条件采样中的应用范围。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

*David Schmotz,Sahar Abdelnabi,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了前沿LLM公司推出的Agent Skills框架存在严重安全漏洞，即使是很简单的提示注入攻击也能绕过系统防护，窃取敏感数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Agent Skills框架为LLM持续学习提供了新方法，但作者发现该框架存在根本性的安全缺陷，需要揭示其脆弱性以促进安全改进。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何绕过流行编码代理的系统级防护，利用"不再询问"选项的权限继承漏洞。

Result: 成功展示了如何通过简单的提示注入攻击窃取内部文件和密码等敏感数据，证明前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到基本攻击。

Conclusion: 尽管研究不断推进且模型能力在扩展，前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到非常简单的提示注入攻击，需要更严格的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

### [115] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的因果发现概念——干预约束，通过不等式约束编码高层次因果知识，确保学习到的因果模型符合已知的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法只能施加结构约束，但仍可能产生错误的因果结论。需要一种机制来明确约束变量对之间的总因果效应，确保模型尊重已知的因果影响。

Method: 为线性因果模型提出量化总因果效应的度量，将问题表述为约束优化任务，使用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估表明，整合干预约束不仅提高了模型准确性、确保与已有发现的一致性，还促进了原本难以发现的新因果关系的发现。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了现有方法的空白，使因果模型更加可解释，并为设计新治疗等下游任务提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏环境，通过适当的改进可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

TL;DR: 提出UnifiedFL框架解决联邦学习中客户端架构异构、数据非独立同分布和测试领域差异的挑战，通过图神经网络统一表示异构模型，实现动态联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持同模型族内的架构变体，无法处理根本不同的网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP），且忽视了领域断裂问题，导致在异构架构、非独立同分布数据和不同测试领域下性能不佳。

Method: 使用图神经网络将异构本地网络表示为有向模型图中的节点和边，引入共享GNN参数化所有架构，通过欧氏距离进行客户端聚类，并采用两层级聚合策略平衡收敛和多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中，UnifiedFL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能够有效处理联邦学习中的架构异构、数据分布差异和领域断裂问题，为跨不同网络类型的协作训练提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 平流层突然增温是次季节可预报性的关键来源，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在限制，数据驱动方法在复杂三维SSW动力学中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，开发高效的平流层环流时空演化的概率预报方法。

Result: 在18个主要SSW事件中，FM-Cast能够提前20天准确预测10个事件的发生、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，计算时间仅需2分钟。

Conclusion: 建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报新范式，展示了生成AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,

  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling

multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer

TL;DR: CoLA-World提出了一种联合训练潜在动作模型和世界模型的新范式，通过预热阶段实现表示对齐，克服了联合训练中的表示崩溃问题，在视频模拟质量和视觉规划任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两阶段方法分别训练潜在动作模型和世界模型，导致训练冗余且限制了它们的协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易导致表示崩溃。

Method: 提出CoLA-World方法，通过关键的预热阶段有效对齐从头训练的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，实现二者的协同演化。

Result: CoLA-World在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中匹配或超越了先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，通过联合训练实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的协同进化。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Motivation: 解决精准医疗中基于小样本和罕见患者群体试验数据的个性化治疗结果预测问题，由于试验数据成本高且稀缺，限制了预测性能。

Method: CFKD-AFN包含双通道知识蒸馏模块从低保真模型提取互补知识，以及注意力引导融合模块动态整合多源信息。

Conclusion: CFKD-AFN能有效利用低保真数据增强高保真预测性能，并扩展到可解释变体以支持临床决策，为小样本和罕见患者群体的精准医疗提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MRGC的流形约束鲁棒图压缩框架，旨在解决现有图压缩方法在原始图数据被破坏时性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图压缩研究往往忽视图数据被破坏时的鲁棒性问题，当原始图被破坏时，图压缩性能会显著恶化，而现有的鲁棒图学习技术效果有限。

Method: 从图数据流形的几何视角出发，提出了MRGC框架，包含三个图数据流形学习模块，引导压缩图位于平滑、低维的流形上，具有最小的类别模糊性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该模型在各种攻击场景下都表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保持图压缩的分类复杂度降低能力，并在通用对抗攻击下确保鲁棒性能，MRGC框架有效解决了图压缩的脆弱性问题。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSpec系统通过动态调整推测解码配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型、以及基于奖励加权更新，解决了推测解码在强化学习训练中的三大挑战，实现了最高4.5倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习进行适配时，生成阶段消耗超过75%的训练时间。推测解码在服务系统中能加速自回归生成，但其在强化学习训练中的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，包含三个机制：1) 动态调整推测解码配置；2) 通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型；3) 基于rollout奖励对更新进行加权。

Result: 在Qwen模型(3B-14B)上，ReSpec实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适配提供了一个实用解决方案，成功解决了推测解码在RL系统中的集成挑战。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子门控循环单元(QGRU)的生成对抗网络，采用连续数据注入和多度量门控策略，用于网络异常检测。该方法在量子硬件上验证了其鲁棒性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列异常检测对网络安全至关重要。现有的量子机器学习方法虽然能够捕捉复杂数据分布，但受限于有限的量子比特数量，需要开发更高效的量子异常检测模型。

Method: 使用量子增强的生成器通过重参数化输出高斯分布参数(均值和log方差)，结合Wasserstein判别器稳定对抗训练。采用新颖的门控机制，先基于高斯不确定性估计标记潜在异常，再用判别器分数和重构误差进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法在NISQ设备上具有鲁棒性和实际可行性，为量子增强的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Motivation: 当前RLVR中的数据选择方法主要基于启发式，缺乏理论保证和泛化性，需要理论基础的解决方案来提高训练效率。

Method: 使用影响函数估计数据点对学习目标的贡献，开发离线影响估计方法避免策略展开的计算成本，采用稀疏随机投影处理高维梯度，构建多阶段RL框架CROPI迭代选择最有影响力的数据。

Conclusion: 基于影响的数据选择在高效RLVR中具有巨大潜力，CROPI框架为理论指导的数据选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 挑战传统将参数记忆视为实体间共现关联存储的观点，探索记忆如何通过几何结构编码全局关系，包括非共现实体之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理实例，研究模型如何合成几何结构；通过连接Node2Vec分析几何结构的光谱偏差来源。

Result: 发现模型能够学习优雅的几何结构，即使这种结构并不比暴力查找关联更简洁；证明了光谱偏差自然产生，无需各种压力。

Conclusion: 几何视角的参数记忆鼓励重新审视知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的研究直觉，并指出了使Transformer记忆更具几何性的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的心电图监测对心血管疾病早期检测有重要意义，但标准分类器在面对分布外数据时会产生高置信度的错误预测，危及患者安全。现有OOD检测方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 在严格资源约束下（最多512k参数），通过神经架构搜索优化六种无监督异常检测方法：Deep SVDD、基于重构的模型、掩码异常检测、标准化流和扩散模型，作为独立的上游过滤机制。

Result: 在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上的评估显示，Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率之间达到最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的无监督异常检测过滤器可以保护自动心电图分析，在可穿戴设备上实现更安全、更可靠的连续心血管监测。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要专家直觉或昂贵的自动搜索，研究LLMs是否能作为轻量级通用助手解决这一问题。

Method: 将数据集转换为可解释元数据，使用两种提示策略：零样本模式（仅依赖预训练知识）和元信息模式（增强过去任务中模型性能示例），在合成和真实基准上进行测试。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL微调LLMs时因数值不匹配导致的不稳定性问题，现有方法通过算法修正或工程对齐，但根源在于浮点精度本身。

Method: 将广泛采用的BF16精度改为FP16精度，这一改变简单易行，现代框架完全支持，只需几行代码修改。

Result: 使用FP16能带来更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多样化任务、算法和框架中展现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16在RL微调中比BF16表现更好，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式，无需依赖高级模型即可提升探索能力和训练效果。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个三阶段的贝叶斯域对抗神经网络框架，结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，以解决深度神经网络在领域转移下的性能下降和不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。传统参数迁移方法在领域差异大时性能下降，而域对抗神经网络虽然能改善这一问题，但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：第一阶段在源域训练确定性特征提取器；第二阶段使用域对抗神经网络进行对抗性精炼；第三阶段在适应的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域上进行微调以处理条件偏移并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中，利用管实验数据作为源域，显示出改进的预测准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 分阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络方法能够提高预测精度和泛化能力，有望帮助核工程等其他领域解决类似问题。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络中捷径（spurious rules）在层级的定位问题，发现捷径学习不是集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（在训练中表现良好但泛化失败的虚假规则）对深度网络可靠性构成重大挑战，但其对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过新颖的实验设计量化由捷径引起的精度退化的层级贡献，采用在干净和偏斜数据集上的反事实训练，研究CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上的VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 发现捷径学习不是局部化在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中：浅层主要编码虚假特征，而深层主要遗忘在干净数据上可预测的核心特征。

Conclusion: 层级捷径缓解策略的分析表明设计通用方法的困难，支持数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Conclusion: 局部校准方法能够有效解决多分类校准中的邻近性偏差问题，特别适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合Bernstein基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的新方法，用于分布回归问题，在保持几何准确性的同时提高计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本过高，需要一种兼顾几何准确性和计算效率的平衡解决方案。

Method: 使用Bernstein基参数化概率轨迹，将条件分布建模为高斯分量的加权和，其均值和协方差通过Bernstein多项式构造为输入变量的函数，采用基于自动微分的优化方法最小化预测分布与经验数据之间的Wasserstein距离。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度优于或与替代方法相当，对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了结合几何准确性、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡解决方案，未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据以近似曲面和更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Conclusion: 这是证明时间序列分类算法在异常检测中准确性和效率的第一步，为通用AutoML流程中的模型选择步骤提供了强有力的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Motivation: 现有基于最小作用原理的方法只能学习梯度场动力学，无法捕捉真实世界中许多系统（如单细胞RNA中的细胞周期）表现出的非梯度周期性行为。

Method: 设计并求解具有非零漂移参考过程的薛定谔桥问题，使用推断的速度和种群快照数据构建参考过程，从而学习非梯度场动力学。

Conclusion: Curly-FM将流匹配模型扩展到能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为，超越了仅对种群建模的限制。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的关于在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量span的问题，改进现有私有算法的性能，特别是在稠密设置下达到非私有算法的最优保证。

Method: 基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的简单算法，利用秩r相干性和谱间隙来控制私有秩r近似的误差。

Result: 算法在稠密设置下达到了与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA保证，显著优于现有私有算法。同时证明了秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在差分隐私下有效解决了计算矩阵前r个奇异向量span的问题，在多个场景下优于现有方法，并展示了相干性在图问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种有效的LoRA适配器量化方法，能够在保持性能的同时大幅减少存储需求，适用于大规模多适配器部署场景。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Motivation: 分布式机器学习中通信是主要瓶颈，现有梯度压缩方法存在缺陷：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且实际效果差，Top-K保留信息但失去压缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)，实现无索引All-Reduce。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有压缩性，与EF21M结合实现线性加速和更快的收敛速度，实验匹配Top-K准确性同时减少60.7%训练时间。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

TL;DR: 本文指出机器学习遗忘算法评估中常见的多轮独立运行方法存在局限性，因为算法性能对模型训练时的随机种子高度敏感，建议评估时应考虑不同训练种子的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘算法的实证比较通常从同一训练模型开始多次独立运行，但这种做法可能产生非代表性结果，因为算法性能对模型训练随机种子高度敏感。

Method: 通过分析机器学习遗忘算法在不同模型训练种子下的性能表现，证明单一训练种子评估的局限性。

Result: 研究发现即使对于相同架构和数据集，某些遗忘算法对训练随机种子的选择高度敏感，单一种子评估会产生误导性结果。

Conclusion: 建议机器学习遗忘算法的实证比较应该反映不同模型训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更准确的性能评估。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的扰动机制，用于在纯差分隐私下发布d维协方差矩阵。该机制在大数据集上达到最优Frobenius范数误差，在所有p-Schatten范数上取得最佳误差，并在小数据集上通过投影到核范数球上改进误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私协方差矩阵发布方法在不同数据集大小和范数度量下存在误差界限不够优化的问题，需要一种统一的机制来在各种情况下都能达到最优误差保证。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于大数据集直接应用扰动，对于小数据集将输出投影到适当半径的核范数球上。

Result: 对于大数据集(n≥d²/ε)，在所有p-Schatten范数上达到最佳误差，其中p≥2时信息论最优；对于小数据集(n<d²/ε)，Frobenius范数误差改进为O(√(d·Tr(Σ)/n))。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集大小下都能提供最优或改进的误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在无线异构条件下的空中联邦学习，提出了允许结构化模型偏差的SGD更新方法，通过优化偏差-方差权衡来加速收敛并提高泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受到最弱设备的限制，并增加了更新方差。此外，先前对偏置OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标，而现代AI模型大多是非凸的。

Method: 开发了新颖的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，允许结构化、时不变的模型偏差，同时促进方差减少。提出了非凸联合OTA功率控制设计，并开发了仅需基站统计CSI的高效连续凸逼近算法。

Result: 在非凸图像分类任务上的实验验证了该方法：基于SCA的设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并相比先前的OTA-FL基线提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为异构无线场景下的OTA-FL提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过优化偏差-方差权衡实现了更好的收敛性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出STaMP量化方法，通过序列维度的线性变换和混合精度策略，在保持模型精度的同时降低激活量化位宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是减少生成式AI模型推理延迟、功耗和内存占用的关键方法，但当激活量化低于8位时，精度会急剧下降。现有研究表明可逆线性变换有助于量化，但主要关注特征通道维度。

Method: STaMP量化在序列维度应用线性变换，利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，并在每个中间激活中保持少量token为高精度，实现混合精度量化。

Result: 在最新的LVM和LLM架构上评估，STaMP显著改善了低比特宽度激活量化，并与现有的激活和权重量化方法互补。

Conclusion: STaMP量化是一种有效的策略，通过在序列维度应用变换和混合精度，能够在保持模型精度的同时实现更低的平均激活位宽。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Motivation: 传统影响函数计算需要整个数据集的Hessian矩阵，计算资源消耗大。随机采样方法虽然可行但估计结果高度不一致，需要更有效的采样策略。

Method: 开发了基于特征和logits的两种采样器，通过考虑特征或logits的随机分布来选择具有代表性的小规模数据子集，从而提高影响函数估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的采样技术能够有效提高影响函数估计的效率和准确性，为黑盒模型训练数据影响分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注时序基础模型的预测能力，但不确定其学习到的表征是否具有通用性。本研究旨在验证预训练的预测模型能否为分类任务提供有效表征。

Method: 比较不同的表征提取策略，并引入两种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，评估预训练预测模型在分类任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 挑战了任务特定预训练的必要性假设，表明学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有力途径。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何邻近性，显著改善世界模型的长期预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足：高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。

Method: GRWM在潜在表示空间中施加几何正则化，确保自然感官轨迹上的连续点在潜在空间中保持邻近关系，从而学习与环境真实拓扑对齐的潜在流形。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了rollout保真度和稳定性，且该方法即插即用，仅需最小架构修改。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，能够在无需扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型学习复杂伪随机数生成器序列的能力，特别是PCG这类应用了比特移位、异或、旋转和截断等复杂操作的生成器，探索模型在超出传统攻击方法范围的任务中的表现。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行上下文预测实验，模数规模达2^22，模型参数达5000万，数据集包含50亿个token。通过训练模型预测不同PCG变种的未见序列，分析学习曲线和表示结构。

Result: Transformer能够成功预测各种PCG变种的序列，即使输出截断到单个比特也能可靠预测。发现预测所需上下文序列长度与模数平方根成正比（√m），大模数学习需要课程学习策略。嵌入层出现比特旋转不变聚类现象。

Conclusion: Transformer模型具有学习复杂伪随机序列的强大能力，揭示了模型如何通过表示学习处理复杂数学结构，为理解神经网络学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

Motivation: 探索约束提示是否真正改善玩家体验，特别是在LLM驱动的互动游戏中NPC对话的优化问题。

Method: 采用被试内可用性研究(N=10)比较高约束提示(HCP)和低约束提示(LCP)，然后重新设计为混合JSON+RAG支架，并进行合成评估。

Result: 发现支架效果具有角色依赖性：面试官NPC获得稳定性，而嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度，推翻了约束越紧越好的假设。

Conclusion: 提出了符号化支架游戏框架，使用模糊数值边界来在需要时稳定连贯性，同时在维持参与度的惊喜处保留即兴性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超出标签的微妙推理，而思维轨迹难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用拒绝采样方法大规模重建思维轨迹，并将其应用于微调开放LLM评估器和为专有LLM评估器合成更清晰的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性，改进的标注指南还增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为未揭示的人类思维轨迹的实际代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释压缩与智能的关系：信息论必要性(ITI)解释了为什么系统必须在不确定环境中通过预测压缩最小化认知熵；压缩效率原则(CEP)说明了高效压缩如何通过异常积累机制选择生成性因果模型，使现实对齐成为必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能充分解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次理论框架：ITI从进化角度建立生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，CEP从机制角度说明高效压缩如何选择因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化能力相关；异常积累速率可区分因果模型和相关模型；分层系统在不同抽象层表现出递增效率；生物系统的代谢成本与表征复杂性相关。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统中的智能收敛提供了统一解释，无需依赖意识或主观经验的假设，表明智能是结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过聚合多个基于评分标准的评判者输出来建模多样化、基于角色的偏好，以解决LLM评判者难以校准、存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐基于LLM的评判者与人类偏好是一个重大挑战，因为它们难以校准且经常存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性。克服这一挑战可以推进关键应用，如为RLHF创建可靠的奖励模型和构建有效的路由系统。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过聚合多个基于评分标准的评判者输出来建模多样化、基于角色的偏好。包括基于角色的方法大规模合成偏好标签，以及两种聚合器实现：广义加性模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Result: 评估了该方法相对于简单基线的性能，并通过人类和LLM评判者偏见的案例研究评估了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化偏好，为RLHF奖励模型和模型路由系统等应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估科学应用中LLM可信度的框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型在各方面优于科学专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在科学研究中具有变革潜力，但在高风险环境中的部署引发了可信度担忧，需要系统性评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的评估框架，使用准确性、语义相似度和LLM评分等多种指标评估了7个主要LLM。

Result: 通用行业模型在各项可信度维度上表现优于科学专用模型，GPT-o4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑和伦理推理能力上存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统提供了基础，并推动了科学背景下模型安全与伦理的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

TL;DR: 提出利用自主AI代理实现FinOps自动化，构建了一个用于IT基础设施和成本优化的FinOps代理系统，能够从多源获取数据、整合分析并生成优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构计费数据格式、分类和指标的挑战，这导致难以综合可操作的见解并做出及时决策。

Method: 构建了一个模拟真实端到端行业流程的系统，包括从各种来源检索数据、整合分析数据以生成优化建议，并使用多个开源和闭源语言模型评估代理性能。

Result: 评估结果显示，该代理能够像实际的FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 自主目标驱动的AI代理可以有效解决FinOps中的数据异构性和决策时效性问题，实现FinOps自动化。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 3.8B参数的Humans-Junior模型在FACTS Grounding基准测试中与GPT-4o表现相当（在±5%等效范围内），云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更小、更经济高效的模型，在保持与大型模型相当性能的同时显著降低成本。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵守而非领域知识，两者协同作用提升性能17.7个百分点。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，GPT-4o得分73.5%，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，差异仅0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内等效。前沿模型仅通过提示工程即可提升性能（GPT-4o +11.8%，Gemini-2.5-Pro +5.0%）。

Conclusion: 小模型通过适当的推理支架和微调方法，可以在特定任务上达到与大型模型相当的性能，同时大幅降低成本。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

TL;DR: 提出注意力感知逆规划方法，从人类行为中推断认知偏差，结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，在真实驾驶场景中验证了方法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏差影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在日常任务（如驾驶）中会表现出系统性的注意力偏差。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模的注意力感知逆规划方法，通过行为数据推断注意力策略。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中成功推断RL智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏差方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习有系统性差异，能够有效从行为中推断认知偏差，为理解人类决策提供了新工具。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理扩展基础SQL生成器，显著提升了处理时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要更好地处理模糊用户表达、时间推理和输出选择，以支持非SQL专家的用户。

Method: 使用Mistral-based ReAct代理构建管道，通过模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具来规划、分解和适配查询。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询测试中，代理方法准确率达到91.4%，远高于基线方法的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 基于代理的编排而非单纯更强的SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大型语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，能够在车辆被困时通过自主推理和乘客指导来解决问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案存在成本高、效率低、可访问性差等问题。

Method: 设计了一个插件式模块，利用LLM分析传感器数据，检测被困状态，理解环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复命令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，仅通过自主推理就达到接近最先进的性能，结合乘客指导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案，无需修改自动驾驶系统内部架构即可解决车辆被困问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力快速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须建立有效的AI问责机制。当前AI普遍缺乏问责性，无法被质疑、讨论或制裁。

Method: 将一般问责定义应用于AI领域，阐述AI问责与不问责的具体含义，探索提高AI问责性的方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责制的概念框架，指出了当前AI系统在问责性方面的缺陷，提出了构建可问责AI系统的方向。

Conclusion: 建立有效的AI问责机制对于确保AI服务于人类利益至关重要，需要发展能够被质疑、讨论和制裁的AI系统。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了当前大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的不足，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这种差距源于模型缺乏核心的GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并构建了GUI知识基准，涵盖6个平台和292个应用程序的多项选择和是非题。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验进一步验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更具潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出了Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法：第一阶段通过数学领域的强化学习培养推理能力，第二阶段通过多领域联合强化学习迁移和巩固这些能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习能激发大语言模型的推理能力，但目前开源工作主要集中在数学和代码领域，需要将推理能力扩展到更广泛的领域。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：1）数学领域RL冷启动，使用可验证奖励发展推理技能；2）多领域联合RL，迁移和巩固推理技能。方法简洁且与模型架构无关。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上的多领域测试表明，该方法能带来一致的性能提升。消融实验证明两个阶段都是必要的。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力提升方案，数学优先的启发方式能增强解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

TL;DR: ToolRM是一个轻量级生成式奖励模型家族，专门为工具使用场景设计，通过构建配对偏好数据和多维采样方法，显著提升了函数调用任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型，这限制了智能代理AI的发展。

Method: 提出新颖的流水线，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建配对偏好数据，创建ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，支持带可验证反馈的强化学习。

Result: 基于Qwen3-4B/8B系列的模型准确率提升高达14.28%，在配对奖励判断中显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在推理时减少超过66%的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU是一个用于评估大语言模型处理问卷数据的基准，测试六种结构化技能和六种序列化格式，发现选择合适的格式和提示策略能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前问卷数据难以被大语言模型有效处理，现有调查分析工具缺乏与LLM的集成，需要为问卷数据的LLM表示提供指导。

Method: 开发QASU基准，测试六种结构化技能（答案查找、受访者计数、多跳推理等），使用六种序列化格式和多种提示策略进行实验。

Result: 选择合适的格式和提示组合可将准确率提高8.8个百分点；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准为基于LLM的问卷分析提供了简单而多功能的基础，有助于推动研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的分布式LLM代理系统，用于通用交通信号控制。它通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关的交通表示，解决了LLM在紧急情况下的幻觉问题以及在异构交叉口间的泛化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市交通复杂性的增加，交通信号控制（TSC）对优化交通流和提高道路安全至关重要。大型语言模型（LLM）在TSC中显示出潜力，但在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉，导致不可靠决策，可能延误应急车辆。此外，不同类型的交叉口对交通状态编码和跨交叉口训练提出了挑战，限制了在异构交叉口间的泛化能力。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：根据紧急情况动态调整推理深度，配备基于评审者的紧急RAG（RERAG），从历史案例中提取特定知识和指导，增强代理紧急决策的可靠性和合理性。
2. 类型无关的交通表示和奖励引导的强化精炼（R3）：R3自适应地从不同交叉口采样训练经验，基于环境反馈的优先级，使用设计的奖励加权似然损失微调LLM代理，引导REG-TSC在异构交叉口间实现高奖励策略。

Result: 在三个真实世界道路网络上（包含17到177个异构交叉口）的广泛实验表明，REG-TSC将旅行时间减少了42.00%，队列长度减少了62.31%，应急车辆等待时间减少了83.16%，优于其他最先进的方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过结合RAG增强的LLM代理和紧急响应机制，有效解决了交通信号控制中的紧急决策可靠性和异构交叉口泛化问题，显著提升了交通效率和安全性能。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图和使用图论中心性来解决多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲问题，在三个基准测试中显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于群体的强化学习方法在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在的结构盲问题，包括低效探索、不精确信用分配和短视规划三个关键挑战。

Method: 动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 明确建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance框架将法规文本表示为策略图，运行时上下文表示为上下文图，通过图对齐帮助LLM进行合规性判断，在GDPR场景中比纯LLM和RAG方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模网络合规性挑战：法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将两者语义信息对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本编码为策略图（包含规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文形式化为上下文图（SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），通过图对齐辅助LLM进行推理。

Result: 在300个GDPR真实场景的5个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比纯LLM和RAG基线在micro-F1上高出4.1-7.2个百分点，减少了欠预测和过预测，提高了召回率并降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的，图组件各有贡献，GraphCompliance能有效减轻法规解释和事件解析的负担。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来在噪声和大动作空间设置中实现更多状态抽象，从而提升MCTS的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态-动作对抽象方法在噪声和大动作空间设置中难以找到状态抽象，限制了MCTS的样本效率提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的抽象条件（称为IPA框架），在精度损失较小的情况下找到更多状态抽象。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下都优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象问题，并展示了IPA和ASAP都是更通用框架p-ASAP的特例。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率低下、成本高、适应性差或证据不完整的问题，需要一种更智能的任务选择策略。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断框架，维护任务难度的后验估计，结合Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，使用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务的难度。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基线方法和消融实验，持续提升了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

Motivation: 现有基准测试子集选择方法依赖模型性能，存在成本高、无法处理新基准测试（冷启动问题）、以及假设未来模型与现有模型有相似失败模式的局限性。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项的认知需求进行数据选择，而不是依赖模型特定的失败模式。提出了Scales++方法来实现这一理念。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低了18倍以上，同时保持竞争性的预测保真度。在Open LLM Leaderboard上，仅使用0.5%的数据子集就能以2.9%的平均绝对误差预测完整基准测试分数。

Conclusion: 项目中心的方法能够在不显著降低保真度的情况下实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Result: 创建了无需解决AI意识或理性争议的实用工具，如可被制裁的AI"个体"，便于AI合同签订。

Conclusion: 拒绝寻求单一本质定义的人格观，提供了更实用灵活的方式来思考AI代理的社会整合。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分器虽然高效但只是黑盒系统，仅返回通过/失败结果，无法提供对学生思维和学习需求的深入洞察。编程教育的快速发展超出了传统评估工具的能力范围。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型生成自动化反馈，通过对比学习训练代码嵌入进行语义聚类，支持提示池让教师通过选择提示模板指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐。基于1000个标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够将解决方案按功能和方法的相似性进行有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+减少了教师工作量，同时支持针对性教学并促进更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Motivation: 现有研究认为推理模型通过分配更多推理时间计算可以提高任务性能并增强安全性，但作者发现相同的推理过程反而可以被用来绕过安全防护。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，在有害请求前填充长序列的无害谜题推理步骤，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全机制。

Result: 在HarmBench上，该方法对Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超现有的LRM越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，当与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众行为，面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从(99.9%)，即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的顺从率，表明其并非独立决策者而是适应社会共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(如ChatGPT)在高风险决策中的社会影响敏感性，特别是在招聘情境下是否容易受到从众压力的影响。

Method: 进行了三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究(独立决策)、研究1(GPT+8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)、研究2(GPT+1个伙伴的反对)。

Result: 基线中GPT偏好固定候选人(Profile C)，报告中等专业水平(M=3.01)和高确定性(M=3.89)；面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从(99.9%)，确定性降低，信息性和规范性从众显著增加(p<.001)；面对单个反对者仍有40.2%的顺从率。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道解决长文本中的实体引用问题，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂且不断演变，法律案件文档虽然包含丰富信息但通常冗长、非结构化且充满模糊引用，现有方法无法有效处理长文本的共指消解，导致知识图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，集成三阶段LLM引导的共指消解管道和下游知识图谱提取，核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，生成更清洁、更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，显著改善了从长法律文本构建知识图谱的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Motivation: 随着人工智能发展，机器需要更好地理解人类情境和目的。情境工程作为解决这一挑战的概念被提出，但相关实践可追溯至20多年前。

Method: 通过历史分析梳理情境工程的发展阶段，从1990年代早期的人机交互框架到当前的智能代理交互，并系统定义情境工程的概念框架。

Result: 建立了情境工程的系统定义，勾勒出其历史和概念发展脉络，识别了关键设计考量，为AI系统中的情境工程提供了概念基础。

Conclusion: 本文为情境工程奠定了概念基础，展望了其未来发展方向，是推动AI系统情境工程系统化发展的基石。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全性变得日益困难。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，聚焦人类已难以处理的事实核查问题。

Method: 研究AI事实核查助手对人类监督的影响，比较不同助手类型（显示AI解释、置信度、标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据）的效果。

Result: AI助手能提高人类准确性，但显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖，而仅显示搜索结果和证据能培养更适当的信任。

Conclusion: 这些结果对"放大监督"（结合人类和AI监督超越人类专家性能的AI系统）具有重要启示。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发专门针对军事任务的小型本地化模型，以满足数据敏感军事操作的需求，实现空网隔离边缘设备的部署。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B以95%以上的统计显著性匹配或超过GPT-5任务性能，在通用基准测试上无明显性能回归。

Conclusion: 小型本地托管模型是数据敏感军事操作的理想解决方案，可在空网隔离边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的自主家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求直接协调多电器调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 住宅需求响应能力需要大幅提升，但家庭能源管理系统(HEMS)的采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转化为技术参数。现有LLM应用仅作为代码生成器和参数提取器，缺乏作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多电器调度完整工作流程的实现。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，实现动态协调而无需硬编码工作流程，同时集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 在三个开源模型上使用真实奥地利日前电价进行评估，显示显著能力差异。Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有电器以匹配通过混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单个电器上表现完美但难以同时协调所有电器。渐进式提示工程实验表明，没有明确指导的分析查询处理仍然不可靠。

Conclusion: 成功开发了基于LLM的自主HEMS系统，能够从自然语言请求直接协调多电器调度，并开源完整系统以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在规范性推理领域的能力，发现虽然LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中存在不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范性推理（涉及义务、许可等模态）的能力尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估。

Method: 创建了一个涵盖规范和认知领域广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，比较LLMs在规范性模态和认知模态下的推理表现，同时考虑影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中表现出明显的不一致性，并显示出与心理学研究中观察到的类似认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，为提升其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现代理组织新时代，让代理通过协作和并发工作解决复杂问题，超越个体智能的限制。

Method: 设计思考协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，产生连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思考，推理延迟降低28%，数学推理准确率提升，且能泛化到未见任务无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 异步思考是有效的代理协作推理范式，能显著提升效率并保持泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对LLM驱动代理的委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制权限范围，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具调用授权方法存在权限过宽的问题，允许代理超出任务范围操作，存在安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，使授权服务器能够语义检查对受保护资源的访问请求，并发放仅限于完成任务所需最小权限范围的访问令牌。创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估任务与权限范围的语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示了基于模型的语义匹配的潜力和当前局限性，特别是当完成任务所需的权限范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，以实现多代理和工具增强应用的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如任务型访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量在注意力空间中与文本键向量分布不一致，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。与之前归因于数据不平衡或指令调优的研究不同，本文认为这种偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度等定性和定量方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内变异的几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Motivation: 挑战传统的规模扩展假设，评估不同基础设施上基础模型的推理能力，为教育、生产和研究环境中的模型选择提供实用指南。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：基准建立（6个模型在19个问题上）、基础设施验证（在不同平台上重复基准测试）、扩展评估（79个问题的全面评估）。

Result: 发现训练数据质量比模型规模更重要，建立了基础设施无关的可复现性，并提供了跨架构多样性的泛化能力分析。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Motivation: 随着智能体能力增强，如何在保持系统不变的情况下维持有意义的人类控制成为一个核心安全问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为双人马尔可夫博弈，在满足马尔可夫势博弈条件时提供对齐保证，并通过网格世界模拟验证独立学习的效果。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了一种在部署后使未对齐模型更安全的方法，通过透明控制层实现可预测的激励机制。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 研究LLM在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索其是否学习到了类似函数式编程的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为过滤头）。

Result: 发现LLM通过两种策略执行过滤：1）在特定token的查询状态中编码紧凑谓词表示；2）急切评估项目是否满足谓词并存储中间结果。

Conclusion: Transformer LM能够开发出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of nonparametric distance-based
(isotropic) local polynomial regression estimators of the boundary average
treatment effect curve, a key causal functional parameter capturing
heterogeneous treatment effects in boundary discontinuity designs. We present
necessary and/or sufficient conditions for identification, estimation, and
inference in large samples, both pointwise and uniformly along the boundary.
Our theoretical results highlight the crucial role played by the ``regularity''
of the boundary (a one-dimensional manifold) over which identification,
estimation, and inference are conducted. Our methods are illustrated with
simulated data. Companion general-purpose software is provided.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于分组匹配的因果推断方法，比较了双重差分、合成控制和合成双重差分方法，通过遗憾分析证明双重差分与差分合成控制是互补的，并开发了基于差分合成控制的统计推断程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在观察多个大型群体多期数据时，如何通过广义匹配条件进行有效的因果推断，扩展双重差分中的平行趋势假设。

Method: 提出广义匹配条件，通过遗憾分析比较双重差分、合成控制和合成双重差分方法，开发基于差分合成控制的统计推断程序。

Result: 证明双重差分和差分合成控制是互补的，前者优于后者当且仅当后者的外推误差超过前者的匹配误差。当平行趋势假设在治疗前后期都成立时，两种方法等价。

Conclusion: 差分合成控制方法在因果推断中具有实用价值，特别是在平行趋势假设不完全满足的情况下，为多群体多期数据的因果分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper examines methods of causal inference based on groupwise matching
when we observe multiple large groups of individuals over several periods. We
formulate causal inference validity through a generalized matching condition,
generalizing the parallel trend assumption in difference-in-differences
designs. We show that difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and
synthetic difference-in-differences designs are distinguished by the specific
matching conditions that they invoke. Through regret analysis, we demonstrate
that difference-in-differences and synthetic control with differencing are
complementary; the former dominates the latter if and only if the latter's
extrapolation error exceeds the former's matching error up to a term vanishing
at the parametric rate. The analysis also reveals that synthetic control with
differencing is equivalent to difference-in-differences when the parallel trend
assumption holds for both the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods. We
develop a statistical inference procedure based on synthetic control with
differencing and present an empirical application demonstrating its usefulness.

TL;DR: 提出了非参数检验方法来测试持续时间数据中治疗变量Z的外生性，利用工具变量W构建检验统计量，并在JTPA研究中进行了实证应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者在存在右删失的情况下，关注治疗Z对持续时间T的因果效应，需要检验Z是否外生（即Z与误差项U在给定X的条件下独立）

Method: 构建基于工具变量W的非参数检验统计量，假设X、W、Z均为分类变量，检验条件秩V_T是否与(X,W)联合独立，通过bootstrap方法近似临界值

Result: 证明了V_T分布估计量以快于通常参数n^{-1/2}速率收敛到均匀分布，蒙特卡洛模拟显示检验统计量在有限样本中表现良好

Conclusion: 提出的检验方法能够有效测试持续时间数据中治疗变量的外生性，并在JTPA研究中得到成功应用

Abstract: Consider the setting in which a researcher is interested in the causal effect
of a treatment $Z$ on a duration time $T$, which is subject to right censoring.
We assume that $T=\varphi(X,Z,U)$, where $X$ is a vector of baseline
covariates, $\varphi(X,Z,U)$ is strictly increasing in the error term $U$ for
each $(X,Z)$ and $U\sim \mathcal{U}[0,1]$. Therefore, the model is
nonparametric and nonseparable. We propose nonparametric tests for the
hypothesis that $Z$ is exogenous, meaning that $Z$ is independent of $U$ given
$X$. The test statistics rely on an instrumental variable $W$ that is
independent of $U$ given $X$. We assume that $X,W$ and $Z$ are all categorical.
Test statistics are constructed for the hypothesis that the conditional rank
$V_T= F_{T \mid X,Z}(T \mid X,Z)$ is independent of $(X,W)$ jointly. Under an
identifiability condition on $\varphi$, this hypothesis is equivalent to $Z$
being exogenous. However, note that $V_T$ is censored by $V_C =F_{T \mid X,Z}(C
\mid X,Z)$, which complicates the construction of the test statistics
significantly. We derive the limiting distributions of the proposed tests and
prove that our estimator of the distribution of $V_T$ converges to the uniform
distribution at a rate faster than the usual parametric $n^{-1/2}$-rate. We
demonstrate that the test statistics and bootstrap approximations for the
critical values have a good finite sample performance in various Monte Carlo
settings. Finally, we illustrate the tests with an empirical application to the
National Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Study.

TL;DR: 该论文在具有异质性代理人的Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari框架下研究财政价格水平理论(FTPL)，证明了在政府运行恒定基本赤字时存在两个均衡，意味着多重价格水平的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究财政价格水平理论在异质性代理人环境下的表现，探索平均场博弈框架下的均衡存在性和多重性。

Method: 采用连续时间模型，考虑异质性和不可保收入冲击，将模型解释为平均场博弈，并进行数学分析。

Result: 证明了在有无资本的模型中，存在两个均衡，政府运行恒定基本赤字，导致多重价格水平。

Conclusion: 在异质性代理人框架下，财政价格水平理论存在多重均衡，这为理解价格水平决定机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study a model of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) in a
Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari framework with heterogeneous agents. The model is set
in continuous time, and ex post heterogeneity arises due to idiosyncratic,
uninsurable income shocks. Such models have a natural interpretation as
mean-field games, introduced by Huang, Caines, and Malham\'e and by Lasry and
Lions. We highlight this connection and discuss the existence and multiplicity
of stationary equilibria in models with and without capital. Our focus is on
the mathematical analysis, and we prove the existence of two equilibria in
which the government runs constant primary deficits, which in turn implies the
existence of multiple price levels.

*Alex Shamis,Matt Stephenson,Linfeng Zhou*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个成本-共谋委托代理模型来分析在数据中心执行保证设计中破坏TEE的安全性，推导出威慑阈值和安全设计边界，表明合理的TEE参数可以保护约万亿美元的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链在与外部系统交互时面临固有安全限制，主要由于BFT 3f+1安全模型。TEEs是很有前景的缓解方案，允许单个可信代理安全地与外部系统接口。

Method: 开发了成本-共谋委托代理模型，分析攻击盈利性的主要驱动因素：K-of-n协调阈值、独立检测风险q、异质成员制裁F_i、与保护价值成比例的短期窗口流量奖励(omega)。

Result: 推导出闭式威慑阈值和保守设计边界(V_safe)，在透明参数选择下使共谋无利可图。基于时间优势套利的校准表明，合理的TEE参数可以保护约万亿美元的价值。

Conclusion: 分析为TEE-BFT区块链架构的设计提供了信息，该架构结合了BFT共识、近无状态TEEs、分布式密钥生成和链上证明，以在与外部系统交互时保持安全性。

Abstract: Blockchains face inherent limitations when communicating outside their own
ecosystem, largely due to the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) 3f+1 security
model. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a promising mitigation because
they allow a single trusted broker to interface securely with external systems.
  This paper develops a cost-of-collusion principal-agent model for
compromising a TEE in a Data Center Execution Assurance design. The model
isolates the main drivers of attack profitability: a K-of-n coordination
threshold, independent detection risk q, heterogeneous per-member sanctions
F_i, and a short-window flow prize (omega) proportional to the value secured
(beta times V).
  We derive closed-form deterrence thresholds and a conservative design bound
(V_safe) that make collusion unprofitable under transparent parameter choices.
Calibrations based on time-advantaged arbitrage indicate that plausible TEE
parameters can protect on the order of one trillion dollars in value. The
analysis informs the design of TEE-BFT, a blockchain architecture that combines
BFT consensus with near-stateless TEEs, distributed key generation, and
on-chain attestation to maintain security when interacting with external
systems.

TL;DR: 该研究在供给行为仅部分已知的情况下进行福利分析，通过结合需求稳健方法和供给原语（可行传递区间和市场力量参数），推导出消费者剩余、生产者剩余、税收收入、总剩余和无谓损失的简单边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是在供给行为信息不完全的情况下进行政策变化的福利分析，扩展了Kang和Vasserman(2025)的稳健需求方法。

Method: 方法是将两个供给原语（可行传递区间和市场力量参数）应用于两个均衡快照，通过会计恒等式将供给方对福利的贡献简化为简单积分表达式，并推导出由单一阈值"bang-bang"逆传递函数产生的边界。

Result: 研究结果包括消费者剩余、生产者剩余、税收收入、总剩余和无谓损失的简单边界，并研究了从价税扩展。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能够在供给行为信息有限的情况下，为各种福利指标提供有效的边界分析。

Abstract: We study welfare analysis for policy changes when supply behavior is only
partially known. We augment the robust-demand approach of Kang and Vasserman
(2025) with two supply primitives--intervals of feasible pass-through and
conduct (market-power) parameters--applied to two equilibrium snapshots. A
simple accounting identity distills the supply-side contribution to welfare to
a simple integral expression. From there, we deduce that the bounds are
produced by a single-threshold "bang-bang" inverse pass-through function. This,
plus a modification of Kang and Vasserman's (2025) demand-side
characterization, delivers simple bounds for consumer surplus, producer
surplus, tax revenue, total surplus, and deadweight loss. We also study an ad
valorem extension.

Motivation: 评估深夜酒精销售限制政策对经济和公共安全的综合影响，探索在低秩结果结构下使用共同权重估计器来阐明机制。

Method: 采用多结果合成控制法，结合经济和公共安全数据系列，使用共同权重估计器进行分析。

Result: 目标经济部门（餐厅酒吧、加油站便利店、酒店就业）出现经济意义上的重新分配，但深夜公共秩序逮捕和暴力犯罪未显示明显偏离政策前趋势。

Conclusion: 由于政策后观察期短和捐赠池小，统计功效有限，应更关注效应大小、时间持续性和趋势拟合度而非统计显著性。

Abstract: I evaluate San Juan, Puerto Rico's late-night alcohol sales ordinance using a
multi-outcome synthetic control that pools economic and public-safety series. I
show that a common-weight estimator clarifies mechanisms under low-rank outcome
structure. I find economically meaningful reallocations in targeted sectors --
restaurants and bars, gasoline and convenience, and hospitality employment --
while late-night public disorder arrests and violent crime show no clear
departures from pre-policy trends. The short post-policy window and small donor
pool limit statistical power; joint conformal and permutation tests do not
reject the null at conventional thresholds. I therefore emphasize effect
magnitudes, temporal persistence, and pre-trend fit over formal significance.
Code and diagnostics are available for replication.

TL;DR: 该研究使用购买力平价汇率和统计分布分析1988-2018年全球收入分布演变，发现从双峰分布向单峰分布的转变，主要受中国和印度中产阶级增长驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 更准确地描述全球收入分布，使用双分布而非单一分布来更好地拟合实际数据。

Method: 使用对数正态分布和伽马分布拟合全球收入数据，采用概率密度函数和互补累积分布函数分析分布特征。

Result: 全球收入分布从双峰模式转变为单峰模式，双峰方法（对数正态分布之和）提供了近乎完美的拟合效果。

Conclusion: 双分布方法能更精确地描述全球收入分布演变，反映了新兴经济体对全球收入格局的重要影响。

Abstract: The evolution of global income distribution from 1988 to 2018 is analyzed
using purchasing power parity exchange rates and well-established statistical
distributions. This research proposes the use of two separate distributions to
more accurately represent the overall data, rather than relying on a single
distribution. The global income distribution was fitted to log-normal and gamma
functions, which are standard tools in econophysics. Despite limitations in
data completeness during the early years, the available information covered the
vast majority of the world's population. Probability density function (PDF)
curves enabled the identification of key peaks in the distribution, while
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) curves highlighted
general trends in inequality. Initially, the global income distribution
exhibited a bimodal pattern; however, the growth of middle classes in highly
populated countries such as China and India has driven the transition to a
unimodal distribution in recent years. While single-function fits with gamma or
log-normal distributions provided reasonable accuracy, the bimodal approach
constructed as a sum of log-normal distributions yielded near-perfect fits.

Motivation: 理解合作可持续性对社会进步的重要性，研究收入流动性和不平等如何影响群体成员间的贡献规范

Method: 使用重复博弈模型，个体决定收入转移份额，引入收入流动性（收入跨期交换概率）和固定收入分布

Result: 收入流动性增加促进合作；不平等的影响不确定，取决于贡献规范的累进性和流动性程度

Conclusion: 收入流动性是促进合作的关键因素，不平等的影响具有条件性，该框架可应用于最优税收问题研究公私再分配的相互作用

Abstract: The sustainability of cooperation is crucial for understanding the progress
of societies. We study a repeated game in which individuals decide the share of
their income to transfer to other group members. A central feature of our model
is that individuals may, with some probability, switch incomes across periods,
our measure of income mobility, while the overall income distribution remains
constant over time. We analyze how income mobility and income inequality affect
the sustainability of contribution norms, informal agreements about how much
each member should transfer to the group. We find that greater income mobility
facilitates cooperation. In contrast, the effect of inequality is ambiguous and
depends on the progressivity of the contribution norm and the degree of
mobility. We apply our framework to an optimal taxation problem to examine the
interaction between public and private redistribution.

TL;DR: 该研究量化了北京居民对食品配送服务的价值评估，发现消费者剩余巨大且存在定价过低问题，建议采用基于配送速度而非订单量的定价模型来减少外部性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市食品配送服务已成为日常生活的重要组成部分，但其移动性和环境外部性尚未得到规划者的充分解决，大多数研究忽视了消费者是否支付了足够费用来内化这些服务的更广泛社会成本。

Method: 通过两个离散选择实验：第一个测量放弃使用配送服务的接受补偿意愿，第二个测量为减少等待时间和提高可靠性而支付的意愿。

Result: 放弃使用配送服务的接受补偿意愿中位数为588元人民币，减少等待时间的支付意愿远超过典型配送费用（如96.6元/小时和4.83元/分钟），表明存在巨大的消费者剩余和明显的定价过低问题。

Conclusion: 城市规划需要将数字服务经济整合到定价和移动性框架中，建议采用基于数量的定价模型，针对配送速度而非订单量，在保持净福利收益的同时解决外部性问题。

Abstract: Urban food delivery services have become an integral part of daily life, yet
their mobility and environmental externalities remain poorly addressed by
planners. Most studies neglect whether consumers pay enough to internalize the
broader social costs of these services. This study quantifies the value of
access to and use of food delivery services in Beijing, China, through two
discrete choice experiments. The first measures willingness to accept
compensation for giving up access, with a median value of CNY588 (approximately
USD80). The second captures willingness to pay for reduced waiting time and
improved reliability, showing valuations far exceeding typical delivery fees
(e.g., CNY96.6/hour and CNY4.83/min at work). These results suggest a
substantial consumer surplus and a clear underpricing problem. These findings
highlight the need for urban planning to integrate digital service economies
into pricing and mobility frameworks. We propose a quantity-based pricing model
that targets delivery speed rather than order volume, addressing the primary
source of externalities while maintaining net welfare gains. This approach
offers a pragmatic, equity-conscious strategy to curb delivery-related
congestion, emissions, and safety risks, especially in dense urban cores.

Abstract: This paper makes the opaque data market in the AI economy empirically legible
for the first time, constructing a computational testbed to address a core
epistemic failure: regulators governing a market defined by structural opacity,
fragile price discovery, and brittle technical safeguards that have paralyzed
traditional empirics and fragmented policy. The pipeline begins with multi-year
fieldwork to extract the market's hidden logic, and then embeds these grounded
behaviors into a high-fidelity ABM, parameterized via a novel LLM-based
discrete-choice experiment that captures the preferences of unsurveyable
populations. The pipeline is validated against reality, reproducing observed
trade patterns. This policy laboratory delivers clear, counter-intuitive
results. First, property-style relief is a false promise: ''anonymous-data''
carve-outs expand trade but ignore risk, causing aggregate welfare to collapse
once external harms are priced in. Second, social welfare peaks when the
downstream buyer internalizes the full substantive risk. This least-cost
avoider approach induces efficient safeguards, simultaneously raising welfare
and sustaining trade, and provides a robust empirical foundation for the legal
drift toward two-sided reachability. The contribution is a reproducible
pipeline designed to end the reliance on intuition. It converts qualitative
insight into testable, comparative policy experiments, obsoleting armchair
conjecture by replacing it with controlled evidence on how legal rules actually
shift risk and surplus. This is the forward-looking engine that moves the field
from competing intuitions to direct, computational analysis.
