Yet current platform designs fail to address participating\nmerchants' concerns about customer poaching. This paper proposes a model of\ndesigning targeted advertising platforms that incentivizes merchants to\nvoluntarily share customer data despite poaching concerns. I characterize the\noptimal mechanism that maximizes a weighted sum of platform's revenues,\ncustomer engagement and merchants' surplus. In sufficiently large platforms,\nthe optimal mechanism can be implemented through the design of three markets:\n$i)$ selling market, where merchants can sell all their data at a posted price\n$p$, $ii)$ exchange market, where merchants share all their data in exchange\nfor high click-through rate (CTR) ads, and $iii)$ buying market, where\nhigh-value merchants buy high CTR ads at the full price.

Drawing inspiration from the illusory\ntruth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods\nincreases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar\nvulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but\nconfidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from\nthe truth.\n  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief\ndynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of\npoisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,\nmodel scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs\nshift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent\nrepresentational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying\nacross layers and model sizes.

Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images\nand audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and\napplies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced\npredictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring\nstable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on\nPOPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that\nSmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining\ncompetitive utility.

In this work, we\ndescribe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by\npresenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different\nscientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical\ninformatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,\nneuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from\ndifferent disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies\nmethods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We\nreport the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who\nprovided both numerical scores and review-like feedback.

To address this\nchallenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with\nSemantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a\nsemantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when\nusing remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our\napproach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with\nsemantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of\nconversations.

Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises\nfurther acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple\nmodels has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs\nspeculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference\nacceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation\nquantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade\nalgorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.\nWe introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the\nmulti-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics\nof acceptance rates and latency prediction.

Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query.

However, showing that only natural-language-like systems\noptimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied\non ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).\nHere, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has\nneglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars\nin general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we\npropose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with\nregard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our\nMDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the\nkey differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible\nones, including \"optimal\" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and\nthat the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from\nregularity.

Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in\npredictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic\ndisparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences\nin accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose\nFairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy\ndesigned for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level\ndemographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a\nclustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while\nenforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for\nthe four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built\non these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected\nperformance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally\nconstructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while\npreserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups\nby up to 40\\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art\nMetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most\nsignificant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for\nfairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource\nsettings.

On this basis, an\nuncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and\nfilter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model\nto maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false\ncontent. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,\nentropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence\ncontrol framework.

Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing\nthe in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,\nincluding personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling\nemerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user\npatterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and\ninstance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level\ninterference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward\npass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical\ninnovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by\nhooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware\naggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant\nenhancements.

The\noverall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a\nregularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances\nalignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate\nits effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,\nincluding distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation\nbudgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and\ndistribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method\nsignificantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,\nand overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.\nThis work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more\ntrustworthy alignment mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8f6c\u79fb\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We address these gaps with\nthe Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach\nthat first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive\nselection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained\nextraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the\nresulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion\nFidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between\nhallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on\napproximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show\nthat, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent\nreductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve\ncompetitive performance in representative deployment scenarios.

The\nderived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more\ninterpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances\nare themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim\nregarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the\nmistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied.

Existing\napproaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or\n'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack\nflexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor\nconstraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in\ninteractive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that\nmulti-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for\nsimulating realistic road user interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u884c\u4eba-\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u4fe1\u53f7\u4eba\u884c\u6a2a\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c4\u5219\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6216\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4ec5\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u91ce\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u8c28\u614e\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e26\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u9053\u8def\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses\nformal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,\ngenerating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals\nwhile ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show\nthat our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods.

However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers\neither rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems\nsuch as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture\nthe decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some\ninadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be\nformally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee\nverifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic\ndecision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for\nfunctions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of\nLLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or\nreal-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and\nverifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically\nanalyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks\nto break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests\nthe ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given\nmulti-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)\ntests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill\ncause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score\n65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art\nLLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity\nincreases.

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7ea620%\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u52aa\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u5c06\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7ea620%\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u6765\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While the discovery of decodable neural\nrepresentations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsuggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly\nindependent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "BEAT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLM)\u9a71\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f53\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u6267\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740MLLM\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u2014\u2014\u89c6\u89c9\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u64cd\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u6076\u610f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "BEAT\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5b66\u4e60(CTL)\u3002CTL\u5c06\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u660e\u786e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cMLLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cBEAT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u4e0e\u5355\u7eafSFT\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCTL\u5728\u6709\u9650\u540e\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5c06\u540e\u95e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e8639%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However,\nmost existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or\nunitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While\ntheoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training\ninstability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure\nstate, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator\ntransforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By\njointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates\ncontrollable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative\ndynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties\nserve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping.

However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench.

We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage.

We analyze\n18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to\nparticipation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing\nstandardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data\ncontribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest\nscale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of\nspeech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing\napproaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working\non improved open-source MT models using the collected data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Awal\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5854\u9a6c\u9f50\u683c\u7279\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7awaldigital.org\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f4618\u4e2a\u6708\u4ec5\u83b7\u5f976,421\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u548c3\u5c0f\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u4f17\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5854\u9a6c\u9f50\u683c\u7279\u8bed\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0awaldigital.org\uff0c\u8ba9\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u679018\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u4e66\u9762\u5854\u9a6c\u9f50\u683c\u7279\u8bed\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u8d21\u732e\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u4f17\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u5229\u7528\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6539\u8fdb\u5f00\u6e90\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all\ntokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning\ntrajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak\ngeneralization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address\nthis, we introduce \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{C}ontrolled\n\\textbf{O}ptimization-based \\textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled\nframework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization\nproblem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a\nprincipled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby\naligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning\ngeneralization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently\noutperforms existing token reweighting methods.

Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set\nof nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each\nprotected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that\ngroup in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to\nincorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,\nparticularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a\ncomputationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a\nnew affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that\nfairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed\non this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$\nclusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the\nsolution of fair clustering.

Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for\nadapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing\nlatency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization\nusing machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key\nlimitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among\nparameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification\nprevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,\nlimiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,\nto reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often\nselects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that\ncontribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most\ncommon method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on\nsurrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient\nexploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel\nframework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and\nlearns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.\nRelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),\nwhich combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity\nto previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple\nDBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and\nhigher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RelTune\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684DBMS\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GNN\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8c03\u4f18\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DBMS\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b80\u5316\u8fc7\u5ea6\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528GNN\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u5f15\u5bfc\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316(HBO)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4eb2\u548c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aDBMS\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRelTune\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eBO\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RelTune\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DBMS\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing defense strategies preemptively build\nrobustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)\nthe infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models\ndue to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)\nlimited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture\ntheir variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nBayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with\nno need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a\nBayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data\npoint's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment\ndatasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with\ntheir safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the\ninfluence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian\ninference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling\nBDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive\ndefense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized\nBayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.\nComprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical\nlearning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before\ncomplex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,\npractical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and\npredicting the onset of overfitting.

Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,\nthe medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.\nTherefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific\ncorpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three\nlanguages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we\nconducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models\nwere fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch\nclinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical\nnotes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task\nperformance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and\ngeneral biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances.

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost.

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty.

The\n  implementation of MedM2T is available at\n  https://github.com/DHLab-TSENG/MedM2T", "summary": "The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical\ndata pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware\nmultimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:\n(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time\nseries, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and\nmacro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and\n(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be\nextended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between\nmodalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns\nresulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and\nMIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease\ndynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality\nprediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression.

Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training\nof model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE\ncomponents, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a\nframework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning\nunknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable\nlatent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational\nalignment techniques.

That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds.

First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed.

To address\nthese challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical\ntokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms\nto ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the\nattention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional\nencoding (GeoRoPE).

However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates.

Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification\nfoundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification\nand sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on\nheterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining\non purely synthetic data.

We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging\nORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs\non optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization\nmodeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4\nachieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even\nleading reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ORGEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u56fe\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408WL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cSD\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "ORGEval\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f100%\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u6240\u6709LLM\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46DeepSeek-V3\u548cClaude-Opus-4\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6076\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Previous work in this area has\nprimarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search\n(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for\nevaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing\napproaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation\nmetrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce\nweight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored\nfor lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:\nthe parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative\ncontribution exceeding $\\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.\nAdditionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize\nthe evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating\nlightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and\nSQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and\nachieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking\nevaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach\nexhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared\nto other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aW-PCA\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\u548cFFN\u5c42\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672cNAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u52a0\u6743PCA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\u548cFFN\u5c42\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u8d21\u732e\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u548cSQuAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4one-shot NAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728FlexiBERT\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "W-PCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
