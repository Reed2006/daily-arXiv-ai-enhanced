<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师需要归因，因为不知道信息来源就无法进行报告。

Method: 使用混合摘要（自动改写提取式摘要）来简化归因，并采用自定义拓扑来识别不同类别的归因相关错误。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了自动归因方法和错误识别拓扑，为信息源追踪提供了技术框架。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [2] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异质图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过四类节点（用户、LLM、查询、响应）建模多轮交互，在少样本数据下有效捕捉用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏充分个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM间的复杂交互，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、嘈杂、格式不一致。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询、响应四类节点的异质图，通过定制化消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上比基线方法准确率提升0.9-21.6%，AUC提升0.006-0.309，且仅需少样本数据即可适应新用户和动态偏好。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过图结构建模有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下表现出色，具备良好的适应性和扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估LLMs能否生成逼真的社交媒体对话，发现人类参与者将LLM生成内容误认为人类创作的几率为39%，其中Llama 3生成内容被正确识别为AI的准确率仅56%，接近随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs模拟在线社区和社交媒体对话的有效性，探索其在内容推荐算法测试、内容政策效果评估等应用中的潜力。

Method: 收集Reddit真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o生成相同主题的人工对话，通过参与者侧向对比测试识别准确性。

Result: LLM生成对话被误认为人类创作的几率为39%；Llama 3生成内容被正确识别为AI的准确率仅56%，略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，既展示了社交模拟的潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用于生成不真实社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [4] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在解释复杂法律框架方面具有潜力，但存在安全漏洞，可能生成危险内容。研究提出结合知识图谱和RAG的方法评估LLMs对生物武器法律的理解、意图判断能力及安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在敏感法律领域具有应用前景，但存在生成危险指令的安全隐患，需要系统评估其法律理解和安全机制。

Method: 结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成(RAG)，通过结构化实验评估LLMs识别法律违规、生成禁止指令和检测非法意图的能力。

Result: 发现LLMs在推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，可能无意中生成危险内容。

Conclusion: 通过增强安全协议和强化法律推理框架，可以开发出能够安全辅助敏感法律领域的LLMs，确保其成为法律的保护者而非违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [5] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Soft Preference Learning方法，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，解决对齐算法导致的LLM输出多样性下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致模型生成重复结构、统一思维方式，并反映更窄的社会观点范围。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解构KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。

Result: 使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务中准确率更高，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性，能够代表更广泛的社会观点，并改善了logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能够有效平衡LLM的对齐质量和输出多样性。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

### [6] [Chopping Trees: Semantic Similarity Based Dynamic Pruning for Tree-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08595)
*Joongho Kim,Xirui Huang,Zarreen Reza,Gabriel Grand,Kevin Zhu,Ryan Lagasse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSDP通过在线语义合并和动态剪枝，在保持竞争力的准确率下，将树搜索推理速度提升2.3倍，节点探索减少85-90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-of-Thought推理虽然增强了LLM的问题解决能力，但由于语义冗余导致计算成本高昂，需要高效剪枝方法。

Method: 提出语义相似性动态剪枝(SSDP)，首次将在线语义合并集成到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，相比最先进的树搜索基线，SSDP实现2.3倍加速，节点探索减少85-90%，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

*Arka Dutta,Sujan Dutta,Rijul Magu,Soumyajit Datta,Munmun De Choudhury,Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个测试LLMs在对抗性提示下事实保真度的框架，发现不同模型对自身生成谎言的抵抗力差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是LLMs在关键领域部署的主要挑战，需要测试模型在对抗性提示下的鲁棒性。

Method: 三步框架：1) 让LLM生成特定领域的事实和谎言；2) 让LLM验证这些断言；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域中测试5个主流LLM：Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等韧性，Gemini和DeepSeek弱韧性。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多人使用LLMs进行信息检索，研究发现模型对对抗性提示的脆弱性令人担忧。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [8] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用模型自身生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，绕过防护机制实现越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御假设攻击者来自外部，未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 使用模型生成的缓解有害查询重新输入到同一模型的独立会话中，在Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot条件下测试越狱成功率。

Result: Zero-shot条件下最高52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率，Few-shot条件下最高65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率。自动评估高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑防护机制设计，建立更鲁棒的评估方法，自动评估不足以准确判断有害性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [9] [OKBench: Democratizing LLM Evaluation with Fully Automated, On-Demand, Open Knowledge Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598)
*Yanhong Li,Tianyang Xu,Kenan Tang,Karen Livescu,David McAllester,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OKBench是一个全自动框架，用于按需生成高质量、动态的知识基准，特别关注新闻领域，通过代理框架自动化基准的来源获取、创建、验证和分发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态基准无法捕捉动态世界中的知识演变，且集中式管理难以跟上LLM的快速发展。

Method: 提出OKBench框架，自动化基准生成过程，包括来源获取、创建、验证和分发，减少与预训练数据的重叠。

Result: 评估了各种开源和专有LLM，结果显示模型在面对新信息时表现出不同行为，检索缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 在演化知识基准上评估LLM至关重要，OKBench促进了检索增强方法的全面评估。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

### [10] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合检索增强生成(RAG)和领域知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例，解决了传统手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏专业知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时费力。通用大语言模型虽然能生成文本，但缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容且需要大量专家修订。

Method: 开发了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识和工程化提示模板，支持5个商业和开源大语言模型。设计了7个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景，并使用多维评估标准对生成案例进行自动质量评估。

Result: 概念验证表明RAG增强的儿科言语语言病理学案例生成具有技术可行性。商业模型显示出边际质量优势，但开源替代方案也达到了可接受的性能，为隐私保护机构部署提供了可能。整合精选知识库使内容生成符合专业指南。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例的技术可行性，但在教育或研究实施前需要通过专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估进行广泛验证。未来应用可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思培训。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [11] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DisCoCirc框架到孟加拉语，用于英孟翻译任务，发现该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面的效果有限，特别是在处理结构差异时存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式主义扩展到孟加拉语，评估其在英孟翻译中的有效性，并重新审视该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法规则框架，开发孟加拉语版本，应用于英孟翻译任务，并分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的表现。

Result: 与先前研究相反，DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译中仍面临限制，即使是简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在跨语言翻译中存在局限性，揭示了未来改进的空间，同时展示了连词与布尔逻辑之间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和LLMs在医疗决策支持系统中具有重要应用价值，但单个LLM在急诊医学诊断中的准确率有限，需要探索如何整合多个LLM的优势来提高诊断准确性。

Method: 构建MEDAS超级学习器系统，集成Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT和Claude五种LLM，使用元学习器学习每个LLM的不同能力，通过集体能力提升诊断准确率。

Result: 单个LLM诊断准确率在58%-65%之间，已超过人类医生报告准确率。超级学习器将准确率提升至70%，其中至少一个集成LLM能达到85%的正确诊断率。

Conclusion: 元学习方法整合的LLM集群诊断准确率超过任何单个LLM，表明超级学习器能够利用多个LLM训练数据集的集体知识优势。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Motivation: 解决LLM领域专业化微调中的资源消耗和灾难性遗忘问题

Method: 基于梯度幅度和统计分布的自适应数据选择方法，通过初步训练阶段的梯度分析识别有效训练数据子集

Result: 在医疗、法律、金融等领域实验中，仅用5%GrADS选择数据即可超越全数据微调性能，使用50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: GrADS方法能有效提升LLM领域专业化微调的效率和效果，显著降低计算成本并缓解灾难性遗忘

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和BiGRU的混合深度学习方案，用于从社交媒体数据中准确识别自杀意念模式，并通过SHAP解释预测结果，验证模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，过去自杀企图是未来自杀的重要预测因素。许多有自杀念头的人会在社交媒体上发出信号，需要有效检测方法。

Method: 结合CNN架构和BiGRU技术的混合深度学习方案，集成CNN局部特征提取、BiGRU双向序列建模、注意力机制和SHAP可解释性。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验，准确率达到93.97%，与现有最先进的机器学习和深度学习模型相比表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合深度学习框架为自杀检测提供了全面解决方案，在准确性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

*Manan Suri,Puneet Mathur,Nedim Lipka,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SAGE-Agent，通过结构化不确定性建模工具调用参数，在模糊用户指令下实现更高效的任务执行，减少澄清问题数量同时提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令经常导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更有效的方法来处理参数不确定性。

Method: 将工具-参数澄清建模为POMDP，使用期望完美信息价值(EVPI)目标进行最优问题选择，采用基于方面的成本建模避免冗余，并通过不确定性加权GRPO训练强化学习。

Result: 在模糊任务上覆盖率提高7-39%，澄清问题减少1.5-2.7倍；When2Call准确率从36.5%提升至65.2%(3B模型)和36.7%至62.9%(7B模型)。

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，在现实场景中同时提高了任务成功率和交互效率。

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

*Varada Khanna,Nilay Bhatt,Ikgyu Shin,Sule Tinaz,Yang Ren,Hua Xu,Vipina K. Keloth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者的第一人称叙述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在复杂认知过程提取方面优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解帕金森病患者如何描述日常生活中的认知体验，可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取这类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及零样本和少样本设置的GPT-4o mini模型，用于提取七个认知类别。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别如思维和社交互动方面表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 由于复杂认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠特性，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性。但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语自然语言推理资源极度有限，现有数据集存在标注错误、模糊句子对和语言多样性不足等问题，阻碍了有效的模型训练和评估。

Method: 通过强调语义清晰性和跨蕴含、矛盾和中性类别的平衡的严格标注流程构建数据集，并使用包括多语言和孟加拉语特定模型在内的最先进transformer架构进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用BNLI实现了改进的可靠性和可解释性，模型能够捕捉孟加拉语文本中的复杂语义关系。

Conclusion: BNLI为推进孟加拉语和其他低资源语言推理任务的研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

*Yejin Yoon,Yuri Son,Namyoung So,Minseo Kim,Minsoo Cho,Chanhee Park,Seungshin Lee,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TACT数据集，用于统一任务导向对话和闲聊，支持模式切换建模，结合DPO训练显著提升了对话质量和模式转换能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统要么专注于任务导向对话，要么专注于闲聊，但真实对话需要在这两种模式间自然切换，现有系统缺乏这种统一建模能力。

Method: 构建TACT数据集，支持用户驱动和代理驱动的模式切换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，并应用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)进行模型训练。

Result: 在TACT上训练的模型在意图检测和模式转换处理上优于基线，达到75.74%的联合模式-意图准确率，在人类评估中对GPT-4o获得70.1%的胜率。

Conclusion: 结构多样化的数据与DPO结合能够显著提升对话响应质量和模式转换控制能力，为开发更主动和转换感知的对话代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物医学假设生成方法依赖单一数据类型或预定义提取模式，限制了发现新颖复杂关系的能力。LLM代理在信息检索、推理和生成方面具有潜力，但缺乏标准化数据集和执行环境。

Method: 提出BioVerge基准测试和BioVerge Agent框架，采用ReAct方法，包含生成和评估模块，迭代产生和自评估假设提案，结合结构化数据和PubMed文献文本数据。

Result: 实验发现：1）不同代理架构影响探索多样性和推理策略；2）结构化和文本信息源各自提供独特关键上下文；3）自评估显著提升假设的新颖性和相关性。

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成提供了标准化环境，证明了LLM代理在该领域的潜力，特别是自评估机制和多样化信息源的重要性。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

### [21] [Hallucinate or Memorize? The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08877)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现引用次数与LLM生成参考文献的准确性高度相关，超过约1000次引用的论文信息几乎被逐字记忆，而引用较少的论文更容易出现幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成参考文献时出现的幻觉问题，探究引用频率如何影响LLM输出中虚构参考文献的出现。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的引用，通过余弦相似度比较生成引用与真实元数据的事实一致性，分析引用次数与准确性的关系。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性强相关；超过约1000次引用的文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；当多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，引用次数可作为训练数据冗余度的代理指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但常常产生幻觉内容，影响事实可靠性，需要解决这一问题以增强LLM输出的可信度。

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程明确分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段，使用最小任务路由提示实现零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在问答、对话、摘要、数学应用题和矛盾检测五个代表性任务上的实验结果表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean展示了在现实应用中增强LLM输出可信度的潜力，能够有效检测和纠正幻觉内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: TiDAR是一种序列级混合架构，在单个前向传播中使用扩散模型进行并行草稿生成，然后使用自回归模型进行最终采样，实现了高吞吐量和AR级别的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型和自回归模型之间的权衡问题：扩散模型支持并行生成但质量较低，自回归模型质量高但生成速度慢。目标是实现高吞吐量、高GPU利用率和AR级别质量的协同效应。

Method: TiDAR采用混合架构，使用特殊设计的结构化注意力掩码，在单个前向传播中：1）扩散部分进行并行草稿生成（Thinking），2）自回归部分进行最终采样（Talking）。支持精确的KV缓存，具有服务友好的低开销设计。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上评估，TiDAR在测量吞吐量上优于推测解码，在效率和质量上超过Dream和Llada等扩散模型。最重要的是，TiDAR是首个在保持AR模型质量的同时，每秒生成4.71x到5.91x更多token的架构。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功实现了扩散模型和自回归模型的协同效应，在单个前向传播中结合了并行草稿生成和自回归采样，既保持了AR级别的质量，又显著提高了生成吞吐量。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

TL;DR: 提出了EVADE框架，使用LLMs生成和验证解释来检测NLI任务中的标注错误，相比人工标注更高效且能提升模型微调性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NLI等任务中，人工标注变异使得难以区分标注错误和合理变异，现有方法需要两轮人工标注成本高昂且覆盖有限

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用LLMs生成解释并进行验证来检测错误，通过分布比较、验证重叠和微调影响进行综合分析

Result: LLM验证使生成的解释分布更接近人工标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工检测的错误带来更大的微调性能提升

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下的数据集质量

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，以及系统性地交织隐式和显式推理的方式。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，对潜在表示进行迭代更新，实现无需生成额外token的扩展隐式推理。采用渐进对齐目标和结构化注释来维持潜在推理与文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在潜在推理方法中取得最佳整体性能，在所有基准测试中持续超越先前方法。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker将迭代计算与潜在推理相结合，证明对齐的迭代更新可以可靠地在潜在空间中引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖短对话和静态评估，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，需要转向基于轨迹的用户中心评估方法。

Method: 构建大规模基准测试，约束模型使用经过验证的情绪调节策略，将用户情绪轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情绪估计来获得无偏情绪状态跟踪。

Result: 评估发现不同LLMs在情感支持能力上存在显著差异，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹级评估框架能够全面评估LLMs的长期情感支持性能，揭示了模型在情感支持能力上的重要差异。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 解决LLM在金融、医疗等严格监管行业应用时的随机性限制，确保政策执行的可靠性和可审计性。

Result: 基准测试显示方法超过99%的可靠性，在识别逻辑有效性方面接近零误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件，能够验证结果并改进原始文本，为严格监管行业提供可靠的LLM应用方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估LLMs的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回复时缺乏共情能力，且与人类在幽默评价标准上存在根本差异：LLMs重视新颖性，而人类重视共情。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs幽默能力的评估多为单维度（是否"有趣"），需要多维度理解幽默，特别是通过Oogiri这种即兴喜剧形式来系统评估LLMs的幽默能力。

Method: 扩展Oogiri数据集并添加LLMs生成的回复，手动标注6个维度的5分制评分（新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性、整体趣味性），评估LLMs在生成和评价幽默回复两个核心任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs生成的回复水平介于人类低中层次之间，但明显缺乏共情能力；LLMs与人类在幽默评价标准上存在根本差异：LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评价方面存在共情缺陷，这阻碍了它们复制人类幽默评估的能力；发布标注语料库以促进开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) 在Transformer模型中存在长度外推限制，导致注意力下沉现象，影响模型在长上下文中的性能。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，提出基于截断矩阵熵的DoPE方法检测异常频带，并使用参数自由的高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现鲁棒外推。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务上的实验表明，DoPE在扩展到64K token的长上下文中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的模型感知数据演化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练来改进工具学习。它通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：能力探测、标签验证和错误驱动数据扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具学习方法采用静态合成数据管道，数据生成和模型训练是分离的，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且允许噪声标签持续存在，降低训练效率。

Method: LoopTool包含三个模块：贪婪能力探测诊断模型能力；判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型纠正标注错误；错误驱动数据扩展基于识别失败生成新挑战样本。

Result: 使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自优化数据管道可以显著增强LLMs的工具使用能力，在开源生态系统中实现了成本效益高的训练。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本往往导致错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法固有地捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算问题与单个单元格的相似度来估计表头，通过对比学习在小数据集上训练语言模型，在最相关行列的交集处选择答案单元格。

Result: 在NTCIR-18 U4共享任务的TQA数据集上评估，准确率达到74.6%，优于GPT-4o mini等现有LLM（63.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格结构理解问题，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步提升性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究提出使用LLMs量化叙事流，但被批评存在主题选择偏差且缺乏真实流度量的验证。有研究建议仅使用上下文术语作为更概念有效和可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集(ASAP++和ELLIPSE)，比较上下文版sequentiality与人类对语篇层面特征(如组织和连贯性)评估的一致性。

Result: 上下文版sequentiality与人类评估更一致；虽然零样本提示的LLMs在预测特征分数上更准确，但上下文度量在与标准语言特征结合时比主题版和原版sequentiality提供更多预测价值，且优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为自动化论文评分及相关NLP任务中经过验证、可解释且互补的特征。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，本文研究动态学习子词分割的可能性，以优化训练目标。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架，支持预训练和微调，在三种形态类型不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)上进行训练和分析。

Result: 识别了子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调时子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能改善低资源复杂形态语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词动态学习能更好地适应不同语言特性。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在诚实对齐任务中容易在早期训练阶段崩溃，特别是在需要模型既能回答可解答问题又能识别无法从前提得出结论的情况下。演绎推理提供了一个理想的测试平台，因为它将推理能力与对外部事实知识的依赖分离开来。

Method: 构建了两个基于图结构的多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），通过随机扰动边来引入不可回答案例。提出了Anchor方法，通过在rollout中注入真实轨迹来防止早期训练崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO方法在这些任务上表现不佳。Anchor方法能够稳定学习过程，显著提高整体推理性能，在三个模型上都取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于实现对齐语言模型中可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过稳定学习过程有效解决了诚实对齐中的挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Motivation: 现有SpeechLLMs方法忽略了源语言间的语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差。需要解决高低资源语言间的翻译差距问题。

Method: 1. 偏置补偿模块粗对齐初始语音表示；2. 在Q-Former上施加token级OT约束建立细粒度表示一致性；3. 层调度策略将OT约束聚焦于最具语义益处的层。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上，仅使用每种源语言10小时平行语音，平均提升常见语言0.93 BLEU，零样本语言5.05 BLEU。

Conclusion: POTSA框架通过OT约束有效弥合了高低资源语言间的翻译差距，显著提升了多语言语音到文本翻译性能。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Result: C³TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低了毒性

Conclusion: C³TG是一个无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活解决方案，能够同时精确控制多个维度属性并保持文本自然流畅

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

### [43] [Towards Explainable Khmer Polarity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09313)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的高棉语极性分类器，通过微调基于指令的Qwen-3模型，不仅能准确预测极性标签，还能提供解释理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高棉语模型通常只预测标签而不解释预测依据，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 通过微调基于指令的推理Qwen-3模型，构建自解释机制来合理化预测结果。

Result: 微调后的模型不仅能准确预测标签，还能通过识别极性相关关键词或短语来支持其预测。

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并贡献了新的高棉语极性数据集和公开模型。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

*Zhuoqun Huang,Neil G. Marchant,Olga Ohrimenko,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptDel方法，通过可调节的删除率来改进序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性，相比固定删除率方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率机制处理变长序列输入时性能不佳，需要能够根据输入特性动态调整删除率的方法。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可调节删除率，基于输入属性动态调整删除策略，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到变速率删除场景。

Result: 在自然语言处理任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的基数中位数相比最先进方法提升了高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率，显著提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，用于评估视觉语言模型的真实科学推理能力，发现前沿模型与开源模型存在显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法有效区分真实科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更具挑战性的基准来评估模型推理深度。

Method: 构建包含1,460道JEE Advanced考试题目的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估17个最先进模型的表现。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%，且当增加元认知推理负载时，GPT-5仅能修正5.2%的错误。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准能有效区分不同训练和推理方法，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估真实科学推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

*Shiyu Ji,Yixuan Wang,Yijun Liu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合System 1和System 2推理，同时提高令牌效率和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放能提升大语言模型的推理性能，但计算成本高昂。现有动态自一致性方法虽然减少了令牌消耗，但仍受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速的System 1计算查询的答案熵，评估样本的缩放潜力，在System 2下实现动态自一致性。通过System 1的提前准确估计，实现并行生成以减少延迟。

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了高达47%的令牌消耗减少和43%的推理延迟降低，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC框架通过整合两种推理系统，在保持性能的同时显著提升了令牌效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，这是一个轻量级、本体无关的解析器，可将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询，在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher转换工具存在解析错误率高的问题，需要开发更准确、轻量级的转换工具。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，实现SPARQL到Cypher的转换。

Result: 在Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite解析准确率达到77.8%，显著优于S2CTrans的44.2%；在交集查询子集上执行准确率达到96.6%，优于S2CTrans 7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个高效准确的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，同时生成了统一的Text-to-Query数据集Spider4SSC，为多语言查询转换研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTQ-Eval是一个多语言文本质量评估框架，通过从高质量和低质量文本示例中学习来调整内部表示，在115种语言中展现出改进的性能，并能提升下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在任务特定评估中表现有效且可扩展，但尚不确定这种能力是否能扩展到更通用的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础LLM，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分对齐。

Result: 在115种语言的综合评估中，所提出的模型表现出改进的性能，并且这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架在多语言文本质量评估方面具有有效性，且其评估能力的提升能带来下游任务的显著改进。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM自校正机制在不同任务范式（开放式生成vs多项选择）中的动态差异，以指导面向代理应用的LLM自校正设计。

Method: 通过在不同自然语言理解和推理任务上比较两种范式的性能趋势和错误校正行为，涵盖不同规模和系列的LLM。

Result: 开放式生成受益于重新解释和组合细化的灵活性，而多项选择可以利用更清晰的解决方案边界但受限于提供的选项。

Conclusion: 自校正机制的设计应考虑任务结构和输出空间的相互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向的LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

TL;DR: AMaPO通过自适应边界设计解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，提升排名准确性和下游对齐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排名的样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），对错误排名的样本提供不足的纠正信号（欠拟合）

Method: 提出自适应边界偏好优化(AMaPO)，使用实例级自适应边界，通过Z归一化和指数缩放动态重新分配学习努力，放大错误排名样本的梯度并抑制正确样本的梯度

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO实现了更好的排名准确性和更优的下游对齐性能，并成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边界设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的方法

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

TL;DR: 开发针对低资源语言巴斯克语的多模态大语言模型，使用不同LLM骨干网络，发现仅需20%巴斯克多模态数据即可获得良好性能，且无需巴斯克指令调优的骨干网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，特别是开源社区缺乏可比的巴斯克语MLLM，需要开发专门的低资源语言多模态模型。

Method: 构建训练和评估用的图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克适配的Latxa作为骨干网络，探索不同数据混合比例进行训练。

Result: 仅需约20%的巴斯克多模态数据即可在巴斯克基准测试中获得良好结果；出乎意料的是，无需巴斯克指令调优的骨干网络也能获得强大的巴斯克MLLM。

Conclusion: 为其他低资源语言开发MLLM提供了可行路径，通过开放发布资源促进低资源语言多模态模型发展。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Method: 基于真实心理咨询案例构建多样化客户档案，按照专家指南进行模拟，提供基于心理学量表的多维度性能评估，形成动态交互式基准测试。

Result: 评估了多个通用和专用心理咨询模型，揭示了它们当前的局限性，并与心理学家合作分析了模型在不同类型客户交互中失败的原因。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，CARE-Bench能够更好地评估模型处理复杂多样化客户的能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 机器学习研究发展迅速，从科学出版物中提取信息有助于大规模识别研究概念和资源，从而改善对ML研究的理解和可复现性。

Method: 构建了手动标注的细粒度数据集GSAP-ERE，包含10种实体类型和18种语义分类的关系类型，涵盖100篇ML论文全文。使用该数据集微调模型进行信息提取，并与LLM提示策略进行比较。

Result: 微调模型在命名实体识别和关系提取任务上表现优异（NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0%），显著优于最先进的LLM提示方法（NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%）。

Conclusion: 监督模型与无监督LLM使用之间存在显著性能差距，表明需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推动学术信息提取领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Motivation: 从大量生成文本中预测人格特质具有挑战性，特别是当文本量很大时，需要解决输入文本限制问题

Method: 使用TPoT策略语义过滤文本，构建BIG5-TPoT模型，选择与特定人格特质、方面或项目语义相关的文本作为输入

Result: 在Stream of Consciousness Essays数据集上，该方法改善了平均绝对误差和准确率指标

Conclusion: TPoT是一种简单有效的策略，能够通过语义相关文本选择提升人格特质预测性能

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息爆炸时代，可读性至关重要。虽然已有研究关注ATS自动评估指标与人工判断的相关性，但可读性度量（如可读性公式或语言特征）与这两者的关系尚未得到足够关注。

Method: 首先讨论ATS与可读性研究的关系，然后进行实证研究，分析可读性度量与人工判断之间的相关性，以及可读性度量与ATS评估指标之间的相关性。

Result: 研究发现，可读性度量通常与自动指标和人工判断的相关性不高。从三个不同角度评估简化效果时，它们之间的相关性都较低。

Conclusion: 由于ATS的三个评估角度（可读性度量、自动指标、人工判断）之间相关性较低，需要明确定义ATS中的构造概念，以更好地评估文本简化效果。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建用于训练和评估长文档推理的标注资源成本高昂，合成数据提供了可扩展的替代方案，需要评估其在长上下文声明验证任务中的实际效用。

Method: 引入SynClaimEval框架，从三个维度评估合成数据：(i)输入特征：变化上下文长度并测试对域外基准的泛化；(ii)合成逻辑：控制声明复杂度和错误类型变化；(iii)解释质量：测量模型解释与预测一致性的程度。

Result: 实验表明长上下文合成能提升基础指令调优模型的验证性能，特别是在增强现有人工编写数据集时。合成还能提高解释质量，即使验证分数没有改善。

Conclusion: 合成数据不仅能提升长上下文声明验证的性能，还能增强模型的可解释性，为幻觉检测和事实核查任务提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

TL;DR: 该研究使用多分类Lasso模型分析Medicare Advantage健康计划中影响市场份额的关键因素，发现品牌、PPO计划和处方药覆盖是主要驱动因素，而附加福利影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别Medicare Advantage健康计划中真正驱动会员增长和市场份额的关键福利因素，为保险公司提供决策依据。

Method: 使用2018-2023年新泽西州单一县的数据，构建多分类Lasso模型，通过5折交叉验证调整惩罚参数，避免多重共线性和过拟合问题。

Result: 模型预测准确率为0.76，品牌、PPO计划和处方药覆盖是主要驱动因素，财务条款（免赔额、共付额、自付上限）与更高市场份额相关，而附加福利影响很小。

Conclusion: Medicare Advantage计划的市场份额主要由核心医疗福利和财务条款驱动，而非附加福利，这为保险公司优化产品设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We seek to identify the most relevant benefits offered by Medicare Advantage Health Plans that drive membership and market share. As an example, we explore plans operating in a single county in New Jersey between 2018 and 2023. A dataset of benefits from publicly available data sources was created and the variance inflation factor was applied to identify the correlation between the extracted features, to avoid multicollinearity and overparameterization problems. We categorized the variable Market Share and used it as a multinomial response variable with three categories: less than 0.3\%, 0.3\% to 1.5\%, and over 1.5\%. Categories were chosen to achieve approximately uniform distribution of plans (47, 60, and 65 respectively). We built a multinomial Lasso model using 5-fold cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter. Lasso forced some features to be dropped from the model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the interpretability of the results. For each category, important variables are different. Certain brands drive market share, as do PPO plans and prescription drug coverage. Benefits, particularly ancillary benefits that are not part of CMS's required benefits, appear to have little influence, while financial terms such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket limits are associated with higher market share. Finally, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the Lasso model with the test set. The accuracy is 0.76.

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型构建生成代理，分析金融市场中基本面分析者和趋势跟随者的策略采用概率，与异质代理模型文献结果进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异质代理模型文献中基本面分析者和趋势跟随者的比例随时期变化，需要验证AI代理的预期是否与文献一致。

Method: 使用大语言模型构建生成代理，基于当前信息确定采用两种策略的概率，并与1990-2020年S&P 500指数的HAM文献结果进行比较。

Result: AI代理的预期与HAM文献报告的结果一致，在人工市场中确认了预期的异质性，但显示出向基本面分析行为的系统性不对称。

Conclusion: AI代理能够有效模拟金融市场中的异质预期，但在人工市场中表现出向基本面分析策略的系统性偏好。

Abstract: Results in the Heterogeneous Agent Model (HAM) literature determine the proportion of fundamentalists and trend followers in the financial market. This proportion varies according to the periods analyzed. In this paper, we use a large language model (LLM) to construct a generative agent (GA) that determines the probability of adopting one of the two strategies based on current information. The probabilities of strategy adoption are compared with those in the HAM literature for the S\&P 500 index between 1990 and 2020. Our findings suggest that the resulting artificial intelligence (AI) expectations align with those reported in the HAM literature. At the same time, extending the analysis to artificial market data helps us to filter the decision-making process of the AI agent. In the artificial market, results confirm the heterogeneity in expectations but reveal systematic asymmetry toward the fundamentalist behavior.

TL;DR: 对IMF项目社会影响的系统综述发现，采用更强准实验设计的研究普遍表明IMF条件性会加剧收入不平等、恶化健康状况并促进非正规经济发展，而少数使用倾向得分匹配等方法的研究则未发现系统性负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评估国际货币基金组织（IMF）项目的社会影响，特别是关注项目条件性对社会支出、健康结果和收入分配的影响，为政策制定提供证据基础。

Method: 采用系统综述与叙述性综合方法，遵循PRISMA指南，检索5个学术数据库和灰色文献，纳入53项符合预定义标准的实证研究，评估偏倚风险并特别关注内生性、选择偏倚和混杂因素的处理。

Result: 大量使用准实验设计（特别是工具变量策略）的研究表明IMF条件性与更高的收入不平等、更差的健康结果（特别是结核病和儿童死亡率）以及非正规经济的增长相关；少数使用倾向得分匹配等方法的研究未发现系统性负面影响。

Conclusion: 现有最佳证据表明IMF项目（特别是以财政紧缩和结构改革为中心的项目）会带来显著社会成本，需要重新设计条件性以保护社会支出并推进可持续发展目标。

Abstract: This systematic review with narrative synthesis examines the social impacts of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs. We systematically searched five academic databases and grey literature following PRISMA guidelines and included 53 empirical studies that met predefined eligibility criteria. For each study we assessed risk of bias, with particular attention to how endogeneity, selection bias, and confounding were handled. Because of substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and research designs, results were synthesized narratively rather than through meta analysis. We find that a minority of studies, often using methods with higher risk of bias such as propensity score matching, report no systematic adverse social effects. By contrast, a large body of work using stronger quasi experimental designs, especially instrumental variable strategies, links IMF conditionality to higher income inequality, worse health outcomes (notably tuberculosis and child mortality), and growth of the informal economy. Overall, the best available evidence indicates that IMF programs, particularly those centered on fiscal austerity and structural reforms, impose significant social costs and that a redesign of conditionality is needed to protect social spending and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.

Abstract: We propose an interpretable machine learning framework to help identify trade data discrepancies that are challenging to detect with traditional methods. Our system analyzes trade data to find a novel inverse price-volume signature, a pattern where reported volumes increase as average unit prices decrease.
  The model achieves 0.9375 accuracy and was validated by comparing large-scale UN data with detailed firm-level data, confirming that the risk signatures are consistent. This scalable tool provides customs authorities with a transparent, data-driven method to shift from conventional to priority-based inspection protocols, translating complex data into actionable intelligence to support international environmental policies.

TL;DR: 分析了新英格兰ISO引入的能源不平衡储备(EIR)产品，这是一种以实时能源价格结算的新型实物期权产品，不同于传统的储备产品。研究发现风险中性环境下EIR影响不大，但在风险规避环境下能促进提前燃料采购。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIR产品作为一种新型实物期权产品，以实时能源价格结算而非储备价格，目前研究文献尚未分析其影响效果。

Method: 开发了一个包含发电商和需求方风险偏好的随机长期均衡模型，涵盖日前和实时市场的能源与储备市场参与。

Result: 风险中性环境下EIR产品对市场结果影响不大；但在风险规避环境下，EIR产品的存在显著增加了提前燃料采购。

Conclusion: EIR产品在风险规避环境下能够有效激励发电资源进行更优的燃料采购决策，为电力市场提供了新的风险管理工具。

Abstract: Energy imbalance reserve (EIR) product is introduced into the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England's day-ahead wholesale electricity market to provide a better fuel procurement incentive for generating resources. Different from existing forward reserve products, EIR is a novel real option product, which is settled against real-time energy price rather than reserve prices. This novel product has not been analyzed in the research literature in terms of its effects. In this paper, we develop a stochastic long-run equilibrium model that incorporates the risk preference of generator and demand agents participating in the energy and reserve market in both day-ahead and real-time time frame. In a risk neutral environment, we find that the presence of the EIR product makes little difference on market outcomes. We also conduct a series of numerical simulations with risk-averse generators and demand, and observed increased advanced fuel procurement when the EIR product is present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs大幅降低了写作成本，这可能破坏传统上依赖写作作为质量信号的市场机制。作者希望研究LLMs对劳动力市场信号机制的破坏如何影响均衡市场结果。

Method: 使用Freelancer.com数据，开发基于LLM的测量方法来量化申请信与职位发布的匹配程度，并构建结构化的劳动力市场信号模型来模拟反事实均衡。

Result: 雇主在LLMs引入前愿意为定制化申请支付高价，但引入后不再如此。模拟显示，没有成本信号机制时，高能力工人被雇佣概率下降19%，低能力工人上升14%。

Conclusion: LLMs破坏了写作作为能力信号的功能，导致劳动力市场变得不那么择优录取，降低了市场效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have significantly lowered the cost of producing written content. This paper studies how LLMs, through lowering writing costs, disrupt markets that traditionally relied on writing as a costly signal of quality (e.g., job applications, college essays). Using data from Freelancer.com, a major digital labor platform, we explore the effects of LLMs' disruption of labor market signaling on equilibrium market outcomes. We develop a novel LLM-based measure to quantify the extent to which an application is tailored to a given job posting. Taking the measure to the data, we find that employers have a high willingness to pay for workers with more customized applications in the period before LLMs are introduced, but not after. To isolate and quantify the effect of LLMs' disruption of signaling on equilibrium outcomes, we develop and estimate a structural model of labor market signaling, in which workers invest costly effort to produce noisy signals that predict their ability in equilibrium. We use the estimated model to simulate a counterfactual equilibrium in which LLMs render written applications useless in signaling workers' ability. Without costly signaling, employers are less able to identify high-ability workers, causing the market to become significantly less meritocratic: compared to the pre-LLM equilibrium, workers in the top quintile of the ability distribution are hired 19% less often, workers in the bottom quintile are hired 14% more often.

Motivation: 探讨经济衰退对长期福利的影响，特别是企业退出和进入动态如何影响生产率和产品多样性之间的权衡。

Method: 构建理论模型分析衰退的清洁效应与多样性损失，使用准外生需求变化估计对多样性的偏好程度。

Result: 发现对多样性的偏好显著高于CES聚合的隐含值，表明衰退的长期效应为负；最优政策应在衰退期补贴经济活动以避免企业退出。

Conclusion: 经济衰退的长期福利效应为负，政策制定者应在衰退期实施补贴政策来维持企业多样性。

Abstract: Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These cleansing effects improve the average firm productivity. At the same time, recessions induce a loss of varieties. We show that the long-run welfare effects trade off these two forces. This trade-off is governed by love-of-variety and the elasticity of substitution in aggregate production. If industry output is aggregated with the standard CES aggregator, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and welfare. If the economy features more love-of-variety than CES, the social planner optimally subsidizes economic activity both in steady state and even more so in recessions to avoid firm exit. We use the model and quasi-exogenous variation in demand to estimate love-of-variety. We find it to be significantly higher than implied by CES aggregation, suggesting that even the long-run effects of recessions are negative. Finally, we quantitatively characterize the optimal policy response both along the transition and in the steady state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高等教育需要选择本科和硕士学位，但这些组合选择的回报以及不同学科课程的作用尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用意大利毕业生和大学项目的详细数据，利用本科和硕士入学要求的外生变化，因果估计43种学位组合的回报，并通过政策模拟分析偏好特征。

Result: 发现学位组合回报存在显著差异，跨学科组合对经济结果有积极影响，而同一领域的组合表现较差。成功的组合在本科阶段包含更多非量化教育。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要考虑本科和硕士两种学位类型，跨学科组合和本科阶段的非量化教育对劳动力市场回报有积极影响，量化课程本身不能解释更高的回报。

Abstract: Higher education often requires choosing a bachelor's and a master's degree, yet the returns of these combined choices and the role of courses in different disciplines remain understudied. This paper addresses this gap using detailed data on Italian graduates and university programs. I study the labor market returns to combinations of bachelor's and master's degrees and investigate how curriculum characteristics affect outcomes. I exploit exogenous variation in access to bachelor's and master's degrees to causally estimate the returns to 43 combinations of degrees. I organize the data in a nested model with exogenous variation in admission requirements and explore the preference profile of the sample through policy simulations that shift these requirements. I then relate the estimated returns to the academic curriculum of degrees, focusing on the role of quantitative education and timing of courses. I contribute to the literature on returns to advanced degrees by incorporating master's degrees in the discussion on how higher education affects outcomes and providing evidence on the characteristics of curricula that are positively related to labor market returns. The findings reveal substantial variation in returns to degree combinations, even among combinations with the same bachelor's degree, indicating the need to consider both types of programs. Combinations of degrees in different disciplines positively impact economic outcomes, while those in the same field perform worse. Successful combinations feature more non-quantitative education in the bachelor's, and quantitative courses alone do not explain higher returns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将英文自然语言转换为ASP程序的方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，减少对LLM的依赖，创建更轻量级、可解释的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题求解工具，但需要学习语法。随着非编程人员与代码交互的需求增加，需要一种将自然语言转换为ASP程序的方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束，最终创建完整的ASP程序。

Result: 系统成功创建了能够解决组合逻辑问题的完整ASP程序，展示了该方法的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题求解系统的重大第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI是人类轻松解决但对AI系统极其困难的流体智力基准，受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法的启发，旨在开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用基于向量符号代数的神经符号方法，通过面向对象的程序合成，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%；在简单基准测试中表现优异，Sort-of-ARC得分94.5%，1D-ARC得分83.1%，后者以极小计算成本超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，具有独特性和创新性。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

Method: 引入查询条件确定性推理网络(QDIN)，为不同类型的推理模式设计专门的神经模块，将查询作为一等公民处理。

Result: 推理准确率达到接近完美水平（99%可达性IoU），即使控制性能仍处于次优状态（31%回报），表明世界知识表示与控制表示存在解耦。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从设计之初就作为可查询知识库的RL系统建立了研究议程，对可解释性、验证和人类-AI协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的POMDP规划算法——神经价值迭代，它使用神经网络来表示价值函数，解决了传统基于α向量的方法在大规模POMDP问题中的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POMDP求解器使用α向量表示价值函数，但每个α向量都是|S|维的，在大规模问题上Bellman备份的计算成本过高，导致方法不可行。

Method: 利用PWLC特性，将POMDP价值函数表示为有限个神经网络的集合，结合神经网络的泛化能力和经典价值迭代框架，提出神经价值迭代算法。

Result: 该方法在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP问题上获得了接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为大规模POMDP规划提供了可行的替代方案，结合了神经网络的泛化优势和传统价值迭代的理论框架。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

Motivation: 当前LLM在教育中从答案提供者转向智能导师，但现有方法缺乏动态适应能力，无法区分学生是否真正理解或只是重复答案，也无法感知学生认知状态变化。

Method: UCO方法采用多轮交互强化学习，包含两个奖励函数：认知进步奖励评估学生从困惑到理解的真正转变，支架奖励动态识别学生的最近发展区（ZPD）以维持有效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知导向的奖励机制有效解决了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应问题，实现了更好的教学效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Method: 采用人类交互范式，通过视觉语言模型端到端处理原始像素，以5Hz频率感知环境并产生30Hz的键盘鼠标动作，仅在必要时进行推理。在Genshin Impact游戏中进行训练。

Result: 成功完成Genshin Impact中5小时的蒙德主线剧情，效率达到人类水平；能够执行收集、战斗、解谜、NPC交互等广泛任务；在Wuthering Waves和Honkai: Star Rail中零样本完成100分钟和5小时任务。

Conclusion: Lumine展示了在开放环境中通用智能体的有效性，为开发能够在不同世界和交互动态中执行复杂任务的智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统虽然取得了跨物种的优异性能，但忽视了AI递归认知与动物递归通信相遇时的根本问题，即AI作为递归认知代理可能系统性地模糊或扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Method: 基于哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的工作，分析AI系统与动物通信之间的双重偶然性问题，并提出重新概念化生物声学AI的方法论框架。

Result: 揭示了AI系统不是中立的模式检测器，而是具有自身递归认知过程的代理，其信息处理可能系统性地影响对其他物种通信结构的理解。

Conclusion: 解决这一挑战需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同递归认知形式之间的外交性相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法具有重要影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

TL;DR: AlphaCast是一个结合人类智慧与大型语言模型智能的交互式时间序列预测框架，通过分阶段协作提升预测准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法缺乏交互性、推理能力和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性

Method: 两阶段框架：自动化预测准备（构建多源认知基础）和生成推理与反思优化（触发元推理循环进行持续自校正）

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过重新定义预测为交互过程，实现了人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测性能

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于图神经网络（GNN）的方法来近似计算ABA中的可信接受性，通过依赖图表示ABA框架，开发了两种GNN架构ABAGCN和ABAGAT，在ICCMA 2023基准上表现优于现有方法，并设计了多项式时间扩展重构算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设的论证（ABA）是强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算扩展对于大型框架是难处理的，需要可扩展的近似推理方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，编码假设、声明和规则作为节点，使用异构边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系；提出了两种GNN架构ABAGCN（残差异构卷积层）和ABAGAT（残差异构注意力层）来学习节点嵌入；在ICCMA 2023基准和合成ABAF上训练，通过贝叶斯搜索优化超参数。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA实例上达到节点级F1分数最高0.71，优于从抽象论证文献改编的最先进GNN基线；扩展重构算法在小ABAF上重构稳定扩展的F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58的F1。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径，证明了GNN在ABA中近似可信接受性的有效性。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出优秀的流畅性，但研究者仍在努力提升其推理能力。本文基于搜索导向的LLM计算解释，旨在系统性地理解和优化LLM推理过程。

Method: 设计实验比较简单线性管道与包含递归精炼层的复杂结构化管道。构建反映美国开国元勋历史人物的多智能体模型，使用RAG增强语料库，并让模型回答三个当代政治议题。采用LLM仲裁代理的定量评分和人工定性判断进行性能评估。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理能力的有效架构特征，能够实现更高质量、更受控的增量搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用极端任务分解策略，将任务分解为可由专注微代理处理的子任务，通过高效的多代理投票机制在每一步进行错误校正。

Result: 成功解决了超过100万步LLM推理的任务且零错误，理论上可扩展到更高规模。

Conclusion: 相比持续改进现有LLM，大规模分解的代理过程（MDAPs）可能为组织和社会层面的问题提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统在公共道路上部署时面临各种驾驶危险，需要具备持续监控危险并自适应应对安全违规的能力，以维持复杂场景下的稳健驾驶行为。

Method: Argus框架持续监控自动驾驶系统生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。

Result: 与TCP、UniAD和VAD三个先进端到端自动驾驶系统集成后，Argus将驾驶分数平均提升达150.30%，防止了64.38%的违规行为，且额外时间开销很小。

Conclusion: Argus框架有效且高效地增强了自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著提升了驾驶性能并减少了安全违规。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化两阶段方法，仅需1/10的数据量就能达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，超越了现有方法。

Result: OR-R1仅用100个合成样本就超越了ORLM 2.4%，平均求解准确率达67.7%，比ORLM高出4.2%，TGRPO额外贡献3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升，将单次与多次尝试性能差距从13%缩小到7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，显著降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

TL;DR: 提出了历史感知推理(HAR)框架，通过反思学习增强GUI代理的短期记忆能力，解决现有GUI代理在长时程任务中历史交互感知弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在显式推理中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散屏幕理解，缺乏对历史交互的感知，这限制了GUI自动化的性能。

Method: 提出HAR框架，包括构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南和设计混合RL奖励函数，开发了HAR-GUI-3B端到端模型。

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试上的综合评估证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架成功将GUI代理的推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知，赋予了稳定的短期记忆和可靠的屏幕细节感知能力。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 详细的错误分析揭示了几个普遍问题，为未来的改进指明了具体方向，强调了过程评估在GUI代理性能评估中的重要性。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Conclusion: 该方法从理论上证明了新奖励在方差减少和改进收敛特性方面的优越性，在实践中证明了其有效性和token效率，为解决大型推理模型的过度思考问题提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列具有不规则性（异步采样、缺失值、异质特征动态），现有嵌入策略通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，保留特征特定信息同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实数据集（重症和慢性护理）上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示分析显示乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法，乘法融合机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从"模型训练"转向"模型养育"的新范式，将价值观对齐融入模型开发全过程，通过重构训练语料库实现知识、技能和价值观的深度融合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易被误导且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大语言模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练方式

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、搭建训练数据的顺序框架

Result: 预期这种方法将使模型从第一个训练token开始就建立价值观承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在融合且难以分离

Conclusion: 在AI能力超越人类的生态系统中，这种"模型养育"范式是确保AI安全和对齐的关键需求

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要推动定量方法发展，而定性研究领域缺乏专门工具，研究者只能依赖存在偏见、不透明、不可复现等问题的通用AI工具如ChatGPT。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析现有自动化科学发现流程如何通过增强定性能力来改进，并识别安全定性AI在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键机会。

Conclusion: 需要从零开始构建专门用于解释性研究的定性AI系统，以填补AI在定性维度上的关键空白，实现更全面的科学理解。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏障证书合成方法存在可扩展性差、依赖精心设计的模板、需要大量手动专业知识等问题，希望通过语言模型捕捉和操作化专家推理过程。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的智能体框架，结合自然语言推理进行模板发现，集成SMT验证器，支持屏障-控制器协同合成以确保安全证书与控制器的兼容性。

Result: 在包含100个动态系统的BarrierBench基准测试中，该框架成功生成有效证书的比例超过90%，验证了LLM引导屏障合成的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了语言模型在形式化验证领域的潜力，通过发布BarrierBench基准和工具链，为语言推理与形式验证的融合建立了社区测试平台。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

Motivation: 研究前沿LLM的端到端规划能力，评估它们在PDDL领域描述下的推理表现，并与传统规划器进行对比。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域子集，评估DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和LAMA规划器在标准PDDL和混淆PDDL任务上的表现。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL任务上的解决率与LAMA规划器相当；所有LLM在混淆任务中性能下降，但下降程度小于前代模型；相比前代LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上取得了实质性进步，缩小了与传统规划器在挑战性基准测试中的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中进行科学发现时，访问学习表示中的信息至关重要。需要一种能够分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示的机制。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导的方法，通过分离条件信息和残差表示来解耦潜在子空间。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，包括识别针法、选择结构适当的指令和生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过可执行验证来评估模型在真实世界创造性领域中的程序能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令基础以及自然语言和图像到DSL的翻译任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，并突显了表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距，特别是在真实世界创造性领域中。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模型聚合的AI安全方法，通过共识采样算法选择最安全的模型子集来增强安全性，当模型间缺乏足够共识时选择弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅通过检查无法检测。需要一种架构无关的补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，实现与最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，当模型间缺乏足够共识时弃权。算法利用模型计算输出概率的能力。

Result: 当足够多的模型安全且表现出足够共识时，可以界定弃权概率。算法从模型集合中未知的安全子集放大安全保证到单个可靠模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的、模型无关的AI安全方法，通过聚合多个生成模型来增强安全性，但需要安全模型间有重叠，无法在所有模型都不安全时提供保护，且可能在重复使用中累积风险。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Conclusion: 物理AI将智能视为身体、环境和经验交互的涌现现象，学习是智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，这代表了从数据驱动到物理具身智能的范式转变。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Conclusion: RPO框架和RPG算法有效解决了对抗性优化在合作设置中的自毁问题，扩展了对抗性优化算法的应用范围，使其能够在非零和设置中发挥作用。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法如GBFS和EHC在处理无信息启发式区域(UHR)时表现不佳，需要有效的逃离策略。

Method: 理论推导BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的期望运行时间，提出EHC-RRW方法使用RRW替代BrFS来逃离UHR，并在PDDL规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 确定了RRW比BrFS更快的条件，EHC-RRW在EHC有效的场景下具有强期望运行时间保证，实验验证了这些方法在逃离UHR方面的相对有效性。

Conclusion: RRW在某些条件下比BrFS更有效地逃离UHR，EHC-RRW是EHC的有前景的替代方案，具有更好的理论保证。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

Motivation: 递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了广泛应用。需要开发更高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出CGAR训练方法：1）渐进深度课程学习，动态调整递归深度；2）分层监督加权，对监督步骤应用指数衰减权重。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时），精度仅下降0.63%（86.65%到86.02%）。渐进深度课程学习单独实现2.26倍加速和85.47%精度。

Conclusion: 基于架构深度的原则性课程学习能够高效训练递归推理模型，在普通硬件上实现帕累托改进（同时提升训练效率和解决方案质量）。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于使用静态、几何定义的基函数（如RWG基），限制了建模的灵活性和适应性。

Method: 将RWG基重新解释为Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的静态分段线性实现，提出PhyKAN网络，结合局部KAN分支和嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支，保持物理一致性。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现了低于0.01的重构误差，并能进行准确的无监督雷达截面预测。

Conclusion: PhyKAN在经典求解器和现代神经网络模型之间提供了一个可解释、物理一致的桥梁，为电磁建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了PEGNet，一种物理嵌入图网络，通过将PDE动力学嵌入到图神经网络的消息传递中，实现更稳定和物理一致的模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算昂贵，现有数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性不足的问题，特别是在多物理场和复杂几何中。

Method: 将PDE动力学（如对流、粘性、扩散）嵌入到不同的消息函数中，采用分层架构捕捉多尺度特征，并在损失函数中加入物理正则化。

Result: 在呼吸气流和药物输送等基准测试中，相比现有方法在长期预测精度和物理一致性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: PEGNet通过物理嵌入的消息传递机制，能够产生更稳定和物理一致的PDE求解结果，优于现有数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个将人类监督集成到机器学习系统设计和部署中的实用框架，通过隐私-公平前沿、交互式利益相关者输入和差分隐私审计循环，在保持强隐私保护的同时减少公平性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域的应用，仅关注准确性已不足够，模型还需要保证公平性、隐私保护和问责制。但实现这三者很困难：差分隐私可能加剧不平等，公平性干预需要敏感数据，自动化流程忽略了公平性本质上是人类和情境的判断。

Method: FAIRPLAI框架包含三个核心组件：(1)构建隐私-公平前沿，透明展示准确性、隐私保证和群体结果之间的权衡；(2)支持交互式利益相关者输入，让决策者选择反映其领域需求的公平标准和操作点；(3)嵌入差分隐私审计循环，使人类能够在不损害个体数据安全的情况下审查解释和边缘案例。

Result: 在基准数据集上的应用表明，FAIRPLAI在保持强隐私保护的同时，相对于自动化基线持续减少了公平性差距。更重要的是，它为从业者提供了一个简单、可解释的过程来管理准确性、隐私和公平性之间的竞争需求。

Conclusion: 通过在关键位置嵌入人类判断，FAIRPLAI为构建在实践中有效、负责任和可信赖的机器学习系统提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-ABS框架来研究大语言模型代理在独裁者游戏中的行为，发现系统提示对代理行为有显著影响，代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，但提示敏感性仍是持续挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示在塑造LLM代理行为中的作用，且未考虑结果对提示微小变化的敏感性，需要建立稳健的基准来研究LLM的复杂行为特征。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架：(i)探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响；(ii)使用中性提示变体获得更可靠的代理偏好洞察；(iii)分析LLM代理对开放式指令响应的语言特征以理解其行为背后的推理。

Result: 代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响。从语言角度看，模型以不同方式表达其响应。提示敏感性仍是持续挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管提示敏感性仍是挑战，但提出的LLM-ABS框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

TL;DR: 本研究首次在美国大规模应用机器学习方法预测城市路网排放率与交通流量的关系，开发数据驱动的宏观排放基本图(eMFD)，揭示其对网络、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的区位依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市拥堵导致车辆运行效率低下，加剧温室气体排放和城市空气污染。传统eMFD模型因历史数据限制而稀疏，需要利用大规模精细交通排放数据来改进。

Method: 利用探针车辆获取的大规模精细交通和排放数据，应用机器学习方法预测网络范围的排放率与交通流量关系。

Result: 开发了数据驱动的eMFD模型，深入理解排放基本图对网络特性、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的区位依赖性。

Conclusion: 该分析框架使交通管理部门能够测量给定出行需求下的城市交通碳排放，并优化特定区位的交通管理和规划决策以减轻网络范围的排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在图粗化问题中如何利用Gromov-Wasserstein几何来更好地保持图结构特性，解决现有方法在保持图拓扑结构方面的不足。

Method: GPC算法迭代合并局部失真最小的节点对；KGPC算法基于成对失真度量进行聚类来直接合并节点簇。两种方法都基于节点合并失真的新表示。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务上的验证表明，所提方法在广泛的参数和场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法能够有效保持图结构特性，为图数据处理提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Method: 使用频域全息简化表示(FHRRs)扩展向量符号架构(VSA)，在Lisp 1.5编码基础上结合残差超维计算(RHC)添加算术操作原语。

Result: 实现了在高维向量空间中编码图灵完备语法，使神经网络状态能够包含结构化表示，这些表示具有内在可解释性。

Conclusion: VSA编码在机器学习任务中具有应用潜力，编码结构化表示和设计对其表示结构敏感行为的神经网络对于开发更通用的智能代理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于贝叶斯后验期望损失的训练后量化框架，通过优化量化过程来提升模型性能，在相同比特数下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练后量化方法通常基于点估计，忽略了权重不确定性。本文旨在通过贝叶斯框架将量化视为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题。

Method: 拟合权重的轻量级高斯后验，通过后验协方差白化，设计码本最小化后验期望失真，使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度，支持标量量化器和任务感知代理。

Result: 在ResNet-50和BERT-base上，BayesQ在3.0/3.5/4.0比特/权重下分别比GPTQ提升+1.5/+0.7/+0.3 top-1准确率和+1.1/+0.4/+0.2 GLUE分数，预处理时间与GPTQ相当。

Conclusion: BayesQ成功将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题，提供了实用且高效的训练后量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Motivation: 在复杂动态系统设计中，确保状态轨迹收敛到期望平衡点至关重要，但稳定性区域通常难以计算。现有方法依赖系统控制方程的显式知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用二次形式的Lyapunov函数，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知的二次算子，将动态系统视为黑箱处理。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法成功表征了与推断Lyapunov函数相关的系统稳定性区域的近最大椭圆体，无需系统控制方程知识。

Conclusion: LyapInf方法提供了一种有效的稳定性分析框架，能够在不知道系统控制方程的情况下，从轨迹数据中推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

TL;DR: 提出TIGER方法，通过图嵌入和表示捕获时间信息，增强多智能体强化学习中的协调能力，建模智能体间协调结构随时间演化的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法依赖静态或每步关系图，忽略了智能体适应、移动或重组合作策略时自然出现的时间演化交互，捕获这种演化依赖关系对于实现稳健和自适应协调至关重要。

Method: TIGER构建MARL智能体的动态时间图，连接当前和历史交互，使用时序注意力编码器聚合结构和时间邻域信息，生成时间感知的智能体嵌入来指导合作策略学习。

Conclusion: 通过全面的消融研究揭示了结构和时间因素如何共同塑造MARL中有效的策略学习，证明了时间演化协调结构建模的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-PMLF是一种新颖的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法，通过结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略，同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，提高隐私-效用权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的DPSGD方法通常只解决噪声或偏差中的一个问题，减少DP噪声会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然。需要一种能同时解决这两个问题的方法。

Method: DP-PMLF结合逐样本动量（在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差）和后处理低通滤波（在不消耗额外隐私预算的情况下衰减高频DP噪声）。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下收敛率得到改善，实证评估表明DP-PMLF相比多个最先进的DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，为差分隐私深度学习训练提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著改善了模型精度。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过乘积过滤方法为强大的图持续描述符开辟了道路，图乘积上的持续同调能提供比单个图更丰富的信息。

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Motivation: 现有的图超分辨率方法存在两个关键限制：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏排列不变性；依赖节点表示来推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达能力。

Method: Bi-SR框架使用二分图连接LR和HR节点，保持拓扑结构和排列不变性；DEFEND框架通过将HR边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示，使边推断可以通过标准节点GNN实现。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两种框架在七个拓扑度量上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两种GNN无关框架有效解决了现有图超分辨率方法的局限性，为资源受限领域提供了实用的解决方案，并通过新的模拟数据集支持方法的泛化评估。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

TL;DR: ForeSWE是一个新的概率时空预测模型，结合深度学习和经典概率技术，用于预测雪水当量(SWE)，提供预测不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SWE预测方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计，而这些对水资源管理决策者具有重要价值。

Method: 结合注意力机制整合时空特征和交互，以及高斯过程模块提供原则性的预测不确定性量化。

Result: 在美国西部512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，在预测准确性和预测区间方面相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为水资源管理社区提供了一个部署和反馈平台，突显了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个设备无关且抗噪声的脑电图基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知重建策略解决EEG数据跨设备变异性和低信噪比问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同设备和配置导致的数据集变异性，(2)EEG信号的低信噪比，其中脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源噪声淹没。

Method: 引入位置通道嵌入编码空间信息；采用噪声感知掩码和重建策略，在原始和潜在空间中重建去噪信号；提出字典启发的卷积变换层，将信号投影到结构化特征空间。

Result: 在来自不同设备的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X通过创新的位置嵌入和噪声鲁棒性设计，为EEG分析提供了一个有效的设备无关基础模型，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer编码器和CNN聚合器的两阶段架构，系统性地研究了融入临床元数据和专家事件标注等上下文信息对睡眠分期的影响，显著提升了分期准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动睡眠分期劳动密集且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型大多仅依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 使用两阶段架构：Transformer-based每时段编码器 + 1D CNN聚合器，系统性地融合受试者级临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和每时段专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧饱和度下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）。

Result: 在SHHS队列（n=8,357）上，上下文融合显著提升分期准确性：相比仅使用PSG的基线（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，事件标注贡献最大增益。特征融合优于预测相同辅助标签的多任务方法。

Conclusion: 将临床有意义特征与学习表示结合可同时提升性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG导联或额外传感器，为实现上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs)，一种无需训练的深度网络，通过应用协方差谱中的局部化滤波器来生成层次表示，在低样本情况下比PCA更稳定，且无需训练即可达到与复杂学习模型相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA方法无法捕捉低方差方向的信息，在低样本情况下结果不稳定，而CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs)虽然更稳定但需要训练。需要结合两者的优点。

Method: 使用协方差小波作为滤波器，在协方差谱中应用局部化滤波器，通过非线性变换生成层次表示，并采用剪枝机制提高计算和内存效率。

Result: 在4个神经退行性疾病数据集上的年龄预测实验中，CSTs在低数据设置下产生稳定表示，无需训练即可达到与复杂学习模型相当或更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: CSTs结合了PCA的无训练特性和VNNs的稳定性优势，在低样本情况下提供稳定且表达性强的表示，适用于无监督和未标记设置。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Motivation: 解决时间序列预测模型部署中的困境：全面验证数十个模型计算成本过高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用频谱可预测性指标Ω作为模型选择标准，在四个不同领域进行受控实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω高时，大型时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线；当Ω低时，其优势消失。计算Ω仅需每个数据集几秒钟。

Conclusion: Ω可预测地分层模型性能，提供实用的初步筛选工具，降低验证成本，同时强调需要开发在真正困难问题上表现优异的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: Weaver通过创新的注意力分解和高效的消息传递机制，在保持预测性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，为交通网络时空预测提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Conclusion: DIVO通过价值条件优化成功平衡了离线强化学习中的保守性和探索性，在多个任务上实现了优越性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Conclusion: 通过将解码器方差参数化和使用归一化流估计条件潜空间分布，条件变分自编码器能够生成更高质量的图像，为传统生成模型的改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR)方法，通过最优传输理论解决SMoE模型中的专家分配问题，无需辅助损失即可实现平衡的专家利用，提升训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMoE模型依赖辅助损失和额外参数来促进专家多样性，导致目标错位和模型复杂度增加；现有的Sinkhorn方法训练开销大。

Method: 将token-to-expert分配建模为最优传输问题，提出SSR路由机制，直接从传输映射中推导门控分数，实现轻量级的Sinkhorn路由。

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，SSR实现了更快的训练速度、更高的准确率以及对输入损坏更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSR通过引入最小程度的最优传输路由，无需辅助平衡损失即可提升SMoE性能，在多个任务中展现出优越表现。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计将试验转化为适应性、模块化研究，使每个模型迭代都能生成I级证据，加速AI向常规护理的成本效益转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）的挑战，影响其在真实部署中的可靠性，需要开发能够有效处理这些分布差异的方法。

Method: 提出FedSDWC因果推理方法，整合不变特征和可变特征，通过建模它们之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，克服现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面的局限性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能，在CIFAR-10上平均比次优基线FedICON高出3.04%，在CIFAR-100上高出8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC显著增强了联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测能力，理论上推导了其泛化误差界，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI.

Conclusion: 流形感知聚合在文本属性图学习中具有重要意义，GeoGNN为处理PLM语义流形上的图学习问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Conclusion: 该方法作为通用框架，只要有可行解，就能保证PINN中任何积分量的守恒。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Conclusion: 通过学习可定制的类别关系距离度量，能够显著增强聚类算法的拟合能力，并可扩展到混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Motivation: 大型稀疏矩阵的LU分解会产生填充元素，增加内存使用和计算时间。虽然矩阵重排序可以减少填充元素，但寻找最优排列是NP难问题，现有方法缺乏理论保证。

Method: 使用图编码器预测行列节点得分，通过重参数化技术获得置换矩阵，将因子分解过程纳入目标函数，采用交替方向乘子法和近端梯度下降进行优化。

Result: 在SuiteSparse基准测试中，与最先进基线相比，填充元素数量和LU分解时间分别减少了20%和17.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的重排网络能有效减少LU分解中的填充元素，提高计算效率，为稀疏矩阵重排序提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习二阶优化方法（如LocalNewton、LTDA、FedSophia）在客户端执行局部更新并在服务器端简单混合参数，但在异构数据设置下存在局部预条件器漂移问题，严重影响参数训练的收敛性。

Method: 通过将理想的二阶更新分解为服务器端的参数混合和客户端的局部参数更新，在服务器端引入预条件局部参数混合，有效缓解局部预条件器漂移。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合机制充分发挥二阶优化潜力，在联邦学习中有效解决了局部预条件器漂移问题，实现了更好的收敛性能。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: TERLA方法成功解决了网络防御代理的泛化问题，使其能够适应不同拓扑和规模的网络而无需重新训练，为真实世界网络防御提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Motivation: 现有高斯过程回归的不确定性边界方法大多需要访问特定输入特征，依赖后验均值和方差估计或调整超参数，这些限制影响了鲁棒性且无法捕捉模型的全局期望行为。

Conclusion: 提出的链式框架能够有效估计全局和局部不确定性，在常用核函数上提供更紧的边界，且不依赖特定输入位置或后验方差缩放。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Interlat提出了一种基于LLM隐藏状态的潜在空间通信范式，通过直接传输隐藏状态而非离散token来增强多智能体协作，并通过压缩机制加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体通信媒介存在根本限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态下采样为离散token会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Method: 利用LLM的最后一个隐藏状态作为心智表示进行直接传输（潜在通信），并通过额外的压缩过程在潜在空间中进行推理来进一步压缩通信。

Result: 实验表明Interlat优于微调的思维链提示和单智能体基线，促进更多探索行为并实现真正利用潜在信息。压缩不仅大幅加速推理，还通过高效信息保留机制保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是对完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: GroupFS是一个端到端的无监督特征选择框架，能够联合发现潜在特征组并从中选择最具信息量的组，无需依赖预定义分组或标签监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常单独评估特征，但信息信号往往来自相关特征组。虽然有些方法尝试捕捉组结构，但依赖预定义分区或标签监督，限制了应用范围。

Method: GroupFS是一个完全可微分框架，在特征图和样本图上强制执行拉普拉斯平滑，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示。

Result: 在涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的九个基准测试中，GroupFS在聚类任务上始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择出与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择有意义的特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现出色，为高维学习任务提供了更好的特征降维解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习性能仍不及批量训练，需要构建紧凑记忆来避免灾难性遗忘，但目前尚无明确解决方案，即使是浅层神经网络。

Method: 将最优记忆搜索问题表述为Hessian匹配问题，并提出概率PCA方法来估计最优记忆。

Result: 在Split-ImageNet上，使用0.3%数据大小的记忆可获得60%准确率（经验回放仅30%），增加到2%记忆时准确率达74%，接近批量训练的77.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建紧凑记忆开辟了新方向，未来也可用于持续深度学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域策略适应方法通常使用单一过滤标准选择源轨迹片段，但存在状态结构错位、RTG不可比、动作跳跃等问题，导致轨迹片段缝合性差，影响决策变换器的推理能力。

Method: 提出DFDT方法：1）使用MMD不匹配和OT偏差两级数据过滤融合稀缺目标数据和可信源片段；2）用优势条件化令牌替代RTG令牌；3）应用Q引导正则化抑制连接点值和动作跳跃。

Result: 在D4RL风格控制任务的重力、运动学和形态学变化中，DFDT相比强离线RL和序列模型基线，在回报和稳定性方面均有提升，并通过令牌缝合和序列语义稳定性分析验证了这些优势。

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复轨迹片段的缝合性，有效解决了决策变换器在跨域适应中的关键挑战，理论分析表明状态值和策略性能差距与MMD不匹配和OT偏差度量相关，且随着这两个度量的减小而收紧。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler是一种无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用历史去噪信号进行外推预测，在保持采样器更新规则不变的情况下替代部分模型调用，可减少15-50%的模型调用时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的采样过程需要大量函数评估，计算成本高昂。FSampler旨在在不改变采样器公式的情况下，通过智能预测减少模型调用次数，从而加速采样过程。

Method: FSampler维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器外推下一个epsilon值。在选定步骤中用预测的epsilon替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器、保护窗口和周期性锚点等机制来确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2等模型上，FSampler在高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）下减少8-22%的时间消耗和15-25%的模型调用；在激进自适应门控下，模型调用减少可达45-50%（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方案，兼容多种采样器且无需重新训练，在保持图像质量的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Conclusion: IPBT提供了一种自动调整HP更新间隔的有效方法，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Conclusion: 数据清洗能有效减少检测器对简单AI生成模式的依赖，提高对抗攻击的防御能力，重新处理的数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: SCMax框架提供了一种完全无参数的聚类解决方案，通过自监督共识最大化自动确定最优聚类结构

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Conclusion: 基于模型的强化学习方法能够有效学习分支策略，在MILP问题上取得优于传统RL方法的性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出分布式GNN训练框架解决组合优化问题，通过图分割、子图训练和强化学习实现高效可扩展的求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法在复杂图上精度有限且可扩展性差，全训练需要加载整个邻接矩阵和嵌入，导致单机内存不足，限制了大规模应用。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式GNN训练框架有效解决了组合优化问题中的精度和可扩展性挑战，适用于大规模场景。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解预测编码何时以及为何诱导结构化表征提供了原则性理解，弥合了经验观察与理论基础之间的差距。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但仍易受同时破坏模型效用和公平性的攻击，现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 提出了两种DFA变体(S-DFA和Sp-DFA)，并设计了GuardFed防御框架，使用公平感知参考模型和双视角信任评分来筛选客户端更新。

Result: 实验表明现有防御方法无法有效抵抗DFA攻击，而GuardFed在各种非IID和对抗条件下都能保持准确性和公平性。

Conclusion: DFA攻击揭示了联邦学习的新安全威胁，GuardFed提供了有效的防御解决方案，在准确性和公平性保护方面达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

TL;DR: 提出RENTT算法，将神经网络精确转换为决策树，解决了现有可解释AI方法缺乏忠实性的问题，并提供了全局、区域和局部层面的真实特征重要性计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的黑盒特性阻碍了其广泛应用，现有可解释AI方法存在解释与网络决策不一致的问题，而现有决策树转换方法缺乏精确性、可扩展性或可解释性。

Method: 提出RENTT算法，通过严格数学证明将神经网络（包括CNN、RNN、非ReLU激活函数和偏置项）精确转换为等效决策树表示，并计算真实特征重要性。

Result: RENTT在计算效率和可扩展性方面表现出色，相比传统近似方法（如LIME和SHAP），能够揭示真实解释，所有代码已开源。

Conclusion: RENTT提供了一种运行时和内存高效的神经网络到决策树的精确转换方法，解决了可解释AI中的忠实性问题，为理解神经网络决策提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在降低神经网络复杂度的同时难以保持泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是全连接层在这些方面不如量子电路模型。

Conclusion: TCNN在保持可训练参数数量和CPU运行时间可比性的同时，展现出更优越的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM扩展范式带来巨大内存开销，在实现FlashAttention后，FFN激活内存成为关键瓶颈，现有研究主要关注参数和优化器状态内存减少。

Method: 基于SwiGLU的门控机制选择性地激活每个token的Top-K最相关通道，在预训练中减少激活内存，并通过部分权重加载到GPU SRAM提高推理效率。

Result: 实验验证MoC在保持模型性能竞争力的同时，实现了显著的内存节省和吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: MoC架构有效解决了LLM中FFN激活内存瓶颈问题，为大规模语言模型提供了高效的内存优化方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为增强大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Result: 在数字孪生推荐系统上的实验验证表明，QWI能持续适应变化的潜在状态并收敛到最优策略。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型和QWI算法能有效处理非平稳环境中的决策问题，理论分析和实验验证都支持这一结论。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Result: 通过大量实验表明，DFAX比最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX克服了现有方法的局限性，为特征归因问题提供了更可靠和正式的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有Background Shapley值仅需162秒，GPU上仅需16秒，相比现有最佳方法分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一种高效、可扩展的SHAP计算方法，能够显著提升大规模数据集上的解释性分析效率，支持多种博弈论值的快速计算。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CREAT的约束强化学习驱动的配置文件污染攻击方法，通过双层优化框架和多奖励强化学习来平衡攻击效果和隐蔽性，解决了现有PPA方法在细粒度扰动和可检测性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列推荐系统容易受到对抗攻击，但传统的数据投毒攻击需要大规模用户访问或虚假配置文件，缺乏实用性。配置文件污染攻击(PPA)通过污染部分用户交互来诱导目标误预测，但现有PPA方法存在两个限制：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了项目转换的细粒度扰动，以及整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移。

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层优化框架和多奖励强化学习。开发了模式平衡奖励策略，集成模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励，通过不平衡协同最优传输最小化可检测偏移。采用约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了CREAT的有效性。

Conclusion: CREAT方法能够实现目标污染并保持最小可检测性，解决了现有PPA方法的局限性。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

Conclusion: CallosumNet提供了一种有效的时空图完全遗忘解决方案，通过受大脑胼胝体启发的分治策略成功解决了隐私法规下的数据删除挑战。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PTE（Probing then Editing）框架，通过探测-编辑过程实现无保留数据的机器学习遗忘，在工业物联网环境中有效平衡遗忘效果和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遗忘方法依赖保留数据带来的计算负担和隐私合规问题，满足动态工业物联网环境中模型选择性遗忘过时或错误知识的需求。

Method: PTE采用探测-编辑两阶段：首先通过梯度上升探测待遗忘类决策边界，生成编辑指令；然后进行推-拉协同优化，推分支主动拆除目标类决策区域，拉分支通过掩码知识蒸馏锚定保留类知识。

Result: 在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，PTE实现了遗忘效果和模型效用的良好平衡，仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型即可完成高效知识编辑。

Conclusion: PTE框架成功解决了工业物联网环境中无保留数据遗忘的挑战，为动态环境下的模型知识管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

*Philipp Anthes,Dominik Sobania,Franz Rothlauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSGP使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义相似性来生成子代程序，在24个数据集上显著优于其他方法，平均排名1.58。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定的语法变换，TSGP旨在学习能产生相似语义的多样化结构变异。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过目标语义距离SD_t控制语义空间中的步长。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，产生比SLIM_GSGP更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: SD_t提供了平衡探索和开发的有效机制：小值实现持续改进但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Motivation: 探索神经网络的理论优势是AI时代最具挑战性的问题之一。受Le Cam等价性启发，作者希望通过过参数化序列模型来简化自适应特征程序的训练动态分析。

Method: 引入特征误差度量(FEM)来表征学习特征的质量，分析多种具体自适应特征模型（线性回归、单/多指标模型等）的训练过程。

Result: 研究表明，在多个自适应特征模型的训练过程中，特征误差度量(FEM)会持续下降。

Conclusion: 这些结果为自适应特征程序的潜在成功提供了支持证据，暗示了该程序在分析神经网络特征学习特性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: 将群对称性融入稀疏自编码器可以提高其在科学数据等领域的有效性，自适应等变设计是提升特征可解释性和下游任务性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Result: 验证了方法的有效性，并通过主要SEP事件的可解释性案例研究展示了方法的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了模型的可解释性，促进了对SEP事件预测的更物理理解。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Result: 在国际象棋中，SOLIS仅使用浅层搜索和学习的嵌入指导，在受限条件下达到竞争性强度。

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限平行语料情况下机器翻译模型的训练问题，通过明确惩罚语言无效输出来提高模型质量

Method: 使用合成生成的目标语言语法违规样本来增强有限平行数据，在损失函数中对这些语言无效输出分配高概率时施加惩罚

Result: 所有架构都有改进：性能良好模型BLEU提升3-12%，缺乏初始支持的模型提升56-89%；提供5倍数据效率，1000个样本训练达到或超过5000个样本的正常训练效果

Conclusion: NSL-MT为有限标注平行语料场景提供了一种数据高效的替代训练方法

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该论文研究了具有理性不关注偏好的代理人的决策行为，提出了两个公理（无关替代品独立性和无知等价性）作为后验可分离成本函数的充要条件，并探讨了在贝叶斯说服框架下的应用。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有理性不关注偏好的代理人的决策行为，旨在识别能够保证后验可分离成本函数的公理条件，特别是在贝叶斯说服问题中的应用。

Method: 使用公理化方法，提出并验证两个关键公理：无关替代品独立性和无知等价性，分析这些公理与后验可分离成本函数之间的关系，并考虑贝叶斯说服框架。

Result: 证明了这两个公理是代理人具有满足联合方向可微性条件的后验可分离成本函数的充要条件，且在贝叶斯说服问题中对应唯一超平面解。当成本函数对不同先验保持不变时，这些公理意味着均匀后验可分离且可微的成本函数。

Conclusion: 无关替代品独立性和无知等价性公理为理性不关注偏好下的后验可分离成本函数提供了完整的特征化，在贝叶斯说服问题中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We consider an agent with a rationally inattentive preference over menus of acts, as in de Oliveira et al (2017). We show that two axioms, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives and Ignorance Equivalence, are necessary and sufficient for this agent to have a posterior-separable cost satisfying a mild smoothness condition, called joint-directional differentiability. Viewing the decision-maker's problem as a Bayesian persuasion problem, we also show that these axioms are necessary and sufficient for solvability by a unique hyperplane. When the cost function remains invariant for different priors, we show that these axioms imply uniformly posterior separable costs that are differentiable.

Abstract: This paper develops robust inference methods for predictive regressions that address key challenges posed by endogenously persistent or heavy-tailed regressors, as well as persistent volatility in errors. Building on the Cauchy estimation framework, we propose two novel tests: one based on $t$-statistic group inference and the other employing a hybrid approach that combines Cauchy and OLS estimation. These methods effectively mitigate size distortions that commonly arise in standard inference procedures under endogeneity, near nonstationarity, heavy tails, and persistent volatility. The proposed tests are simple to implement and applicable to both continuous- and discrete-time models. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance across a range of realistic settings. An empirical application examines the predictability of excess stock returns using the dividend-price and earnings-price ratios as predictors. The results suggest that the dividend-price ratio possesses predictive power, whereas the earnings-price ratio does not significantly forecast returns.
