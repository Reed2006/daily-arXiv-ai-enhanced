### [1] [Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20634)
*Shanjukta Nath,Jiwon Hong,Jae Ho Chang,Keith Warren,Subhadeep Paul*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 使用预训练的基于transformer的大语言模型（LLM）对8万-12万条低安全级别惩教机构中居民之间的书面肯定和纠正交流进行嵌入分析，发现这些AI嵌入向量对累犯行为的预测准确性比仅使用入狱前协变量高出30%。通过零样本分类将高维文本嵌入转换为低维用户定义类别以增强可解释性，同时保持预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究惩教机构中居民之间的语言交流模式如何影响累犯行为，并开发新的方法来分析社交网络中的同伴效应，特别是在稀疏网络、多变量潜变量和相关多变量结果的情况下。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成文本嵌入向量，进行零样本分类降维，开发新的多变量同伴效应模型来估计语言使用中的同伴效应，并调整网络内生性问题。

Result: 发现语言使用中的同伴效应显著，特别是在互动和反馈方面。新开发的方法能够有效处理稀疏网络和多变量潜变量等复杂情况。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本嵌入向量是预测累犯行为的有效工具，惩教机构中的语言交流模式存在显著的同伴效应，新开发的统计方法为分析社交网络中的语言动态提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

### [2] [Overidentification testing with weak instruments and heteroskedasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21096)
*Stuart Lane,Frank Windmeijer*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文比较了Kleibergen-Paap（KP）秩检验与传统的J检验作为异方差稳健的过度识别检验，发现KP检验通常表现更好，而J检验容易出现严重的尺寸扭曲。建议在弱工具变量情况下使用KP检验而非J检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究工具变量估计中的外生性检验问题，特别是在弱工具变量和异方差条件下的过度识别检验性能比较。重新审视生命周期消费模型中跨期替代弹性（EIS）的估计问题。

Method: 推导了J检验和KP检验在异方差弱工具变量情况下的极限分布，作为通过2SLS和LIML估计的稳健得分检验的特殊情况。进行了蒙特卡洛模拟来比较两种检验的性能。

Result: 蒙特卡洛模拟显示KP检验通常比J检验表现更好，J检验容易出现严重的尺寸扭曲。在EIS估计的应用中，J检验经常拒绝有效工具变量的原假设，而KP检验则不拒绝。

Conclusion: 建议在弱工具变量情况下使用KP检验而非J检验。文献中EIS估计值的广泛范围不太可能是由工具变量无效性/设定错误引起的。

Abstract: Exogeneity is key for IV estimators, which can assessed via
overidentification (OID) tests. We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test
as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We
derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP
as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML
respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than
J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model
parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative
approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID
tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption
models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but
frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates
for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J
often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects,
sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We
also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of
the range of EIS estimates in the literature.

### [3] [Integrated analysis of informality, minimum wage, and monopsony power: A synthesis of meta-analyses with unified theoretical underpinnings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20465)
*Ricardo Alonzo Fernandez Salguero*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文通过整合和元分析现有系统综述，研究了劳动力市场的非正规性、最低工资效应和买方垄断权力三个相互关联的领域，发现传统观点往往高估了这些效应的规模，并揭示了普遍存在的发表偏倚问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合现有关于劳动力市场三个关键领域（非正规性、最低工资效应、买方垄断权力）的研究成果，通过元分析方法揭示传统观点的局限性，并为理论和政策提供更准确的证据基础。

Method: 采用整合和元分析方法，对多个现有系统综述和元分析的研究结果进行综合分析，并引入一个整合了企业异质性、买方垄断权力和内生正规化决策的理论模型来微观基础化实证发现。

Result: 研究发现：仅基于降低正规化成本的非正规性减少政策效果有限；最低工资对就业的影响（通过自有工资弹性衡量）相对温和；所有研究领域普遍存在发表偏倚，校正后的效应估计值通常趋近于零。

Conclusion: 元回归分析是识别异质性和真实基础效应的关键工具，需要重新校准理论和经济政策建议，采用更细致和整合的方法，同时强调发表偏倚对文献报告的效应规模的夸大影响。

Abstract: This document offers a synthesis of recent economic literature on three
interconnected areas of labor markets: informality, the effects of the minimum
wage, and monopsony power. Through the consolidation and meta-analysis of
findings from multiple existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, their
causes, consequences, and associated public policies are examined. It is
concluded that conventional views on these topics often overestimate the
magnitude of effects. Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering
formalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the
extensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage
on employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently
modest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains. To
reconcile and microfound these findings, an integrated theoretical model of
firm optimization is introduced, simultaneously incorporating firm
heterogeneity, monopsony power, and endogenous formality decisions, rigorously
demonstrating how the interaction of these forces can explain the observed
empirical regularities. A cross-cutting and significant finding is the
omnipresence of publication bias across all these study areas, which tends to
inflate the magnitude of the effects reported in the published literature.
Corrected estimates of the effects generally approach zero. Meta-regression is
established as an indispensable tool for identifying heterogeneity and the true
underlying effects in the empirical evidence, compelling a recalibration of
both theory and economic policy recommendations towards a more nuanced and
integrated approach.

### [4] [Börgers's Open Question Resolved](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20790)
*Siyang Xiong*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机有限行动机制下的实施问题，在无支配策略和迭代无支配策略框架下，解决了Börgers(1995)中的开放性问题，并提供了超出传统假设的首个积极结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Börgers(1995)中关于随机有限行动机制实施问题的开放性问题，挑战传统认为纳什实施需要可分离性、拟线性或无限行动集等严格假设的认知。

Method: 研究随机有限行动机制，分析在无支配策略和迭代无支配策略框架下的实施可能性，建立可能性与不可能性结果。

Result: 建立了可能性与不可能性结果，解决了Börgers(1995)中的开放性问题，并提供了首个超出传统严格假设的积极实施结果。

Conclusion: 证明在随机有限行动机制下，即使不依赖传统的可分离性、拟线性或无限行动集等假设，也能实现有效的策略实施，这拓展了机制设计的理论边界。

Abstract: Focusing on stochastic finite-action mechanisms, we study implementation in
undominated strategies and iteratively undominated strategies. We establish
both possibility and impossibility results that resolve the open question in
B\"orgers (1995). Contrary to the conventional understanding that positive
results on Nash implementation need separability, quasilinearity, or infinite
action sets, we provide -- to our knowledge -- the first positive result beyond
those demanding assumptions.

### [5] [A Theory of Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20408)
*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多智能体生成流网络（MA-GFlowNets）的理论框架，使多个智能体能够通过联合动作协作生成对象，并提出了四种算法，实验证明其优于强化学习和MCMC方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成对象的随机策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，包括集中式流网络、独立流网络、联合流网络及其条件版本四种算法，基于局部-全局原则进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架在性能上优于强化学习和基于MCMC的方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets为多智能体协作生成提供了理论保证，证明了独立策略生成样本的概率与奖励函数成正比。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

### [6] [Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化的逆强化学习方法，将最大熵IRL转化为两个监督学习问题：概率分类估计行为策略，以及迭代回归求解固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆强化学习方法涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。本文旨在简化IRL流程。

Method: 通过分析发现最大似然解可由行为策略的线性固定点方程表征，从而将IRL分解为概率分类和迭代回归两个监督学习任务。

Result: 提出的方法简单模块化，适用于不同函数逼近器，实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为IRL提供了更简洁有效的解决方案，降低了实现复杂度，便于实际应用。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

### [7] [FastEagle: Cascaded Drafting for Accelerating Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20416)
*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，替代了传统草稿器需要N次顺序传递的方法，实现了更快的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来提出N个token，限制了推理速度。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿过程中的顺序依赖关系，实现更高效的LLM推理加速。

Method: FastEagle采用非自回归级联草稿器，用轻量级层级联替换时间步骤，并通过层间监督训练来减轻错误累积。结合约束草稿树保持无损验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务（MT-Bench、HumanEval、GSM8K等）上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下均优于EAGLE-3的速度提升，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 去除草稿中的顺序依赖是实现无损LLM推理加速的实用路径，FastEagle展示了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

### [8] [mloz: A Highly Efficient Machine Learning-Based Ozone Parameterization for Climate Sensitivity Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20422)
*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种机器学习参数化方法（mloz），用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧的日变化和趋势，解决了传统化学方案计算成本高的问题。该方法仅需大气温度剖面信息作为输入，比传统化学方案快31倍，且可在不同气候模型间迁移使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数参与耦合模式比较项目（CMIP）的气候模型由于大气化学方案计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这限制了气候敏感性模拟的准确性。臭氧作为重要的太阳辐射吸收体和温室气体，其变化会显著影响气候反馈过程。

Method: 开发了机器学习参数化方法mloz，仅使用大气温度剖面信息作为输入，在UKESM和ICON两种气候模型中在线模拟臭氧的日变化和趋势，包括与准两年振荡的双向相互作用。

Result: mloz在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，比UKESM中的化学方案快31倍，仅占气候模型总运行时间的不到4%。该方法成功从UKESM迁移到ICON，展示了跨模型的可迁移性。

Conclusion: mloz参数化方法具有在缺乏交互式化学方案的CMIP级气候模型中广泛应用的潜力，特别是在关注气候敏感性模拟的未来气候变化评估中，能够有效捕捉臭氧趋势和变化对大气反馈过程的调制作用。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

### [9] [Bridging Privacy and Utility: Synthesizing anonymized EEG with constraining utility functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20454)
*Kay Fuhrmeister,Arne Pelzer,Fabian Radke,Julia Lechinger,Mahzad Gharleghi,Thomas Köllmer,Insa Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于transformer的自编码器方法，用于对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，在保持EEG数据对特定机器学习任务（如睡眠分期）的实用性的同时，防止受试者重新识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护成为重要问题。研究表明EEG数据存在重新识别和其他个人信息泄露的风险，因此需要在保留数据实用性的同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 使用基于transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，通过评估匿名化前后的重新识别风险和实用性能来验证方法有效性。

Result: 结果显示，该方法能够显著降低EEG信号的重新识别能力，同时保持其在机器学习任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在保护EEG数据隐私方面具有有效性，为EEG数据的隐私保护提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

### [10] [Efficiently Attacking Memorization Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20463)
*Tue Do,Varun Chandrasekaran,Daniel Alabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于记忆化评分的影响估计算法在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，提出了一个实用的攻击方法，并验证了即使最先进的影响估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着影响估计工具在数据评估和负责任机器学习中的广泛应用，需要研究这些评分本身是否能够被对抗性操纵，以揭示影响估计方法的潜在漏洞。

Method: 提出了一个实用的攻击方法，通过计算输入的伪逆来产生高度记忆化的样本，该方法仅需要模型输出的黑盒访问，计算开销适中。

Result: 在广泛的图像分类任务上验证了攻击的有效性，表明即使最先进的影响估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵。理论分析揭示了影响估计在对抗性扰动下的固有脆弱性条件。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了基于影响的归因方法存在关键漏洞，需要开发鲁棒的防御机制来应对这些安全威胁。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

### [11] [Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478)
*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一对比表示和时序距离框架的方法，利用拟度量表示空间结构学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习（GCRL）方法主要使用对比表示或时序距离两种框架，但各自存在局限性。对比表示方法在拼接任务上表现不佳，而拟度量网络方法在噪声高维环境中表现较差。

Method: 结合拟度量表示空间的结构（三角不等式）和适当的约束条件，学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。该方法能够利用拟度量距离参数化学习最优目标到达距离，即使使用次优数据和随机环境。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，同时在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了蒙特卡洛对比强化学习方法的稳定性和长程能力，以及拟度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力，实现了两种框架的优势互补。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

*D. Darankoum,C. Habermacher,J. Volle,S. Grudinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端的深度学习框架，通过多尺度频率振荡编码器、基于注意力的通道交互建模、动态门控网络和新型损失函数，从原始EEG信号中提取生物意义模式并处理噪声和通道变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号包含丰富的多尺度信息，对理解脑状态和疾病诊断有重要应用价值，但从原始EEG信号中提取有意义的特征同时处理噪声和通道变异性仍是一个主要挑战。

Method: 设计多尺度频率振荡编码器；引入基于注意力的编码器学习EEG通道间和通道内局部patch的交互；集成动态门控网络过滤噪声通道；使用结合监督学习和对比学习的新型损失函数。

Result: 在多个CNS疾病治疗分类以及帕金森病和阿尔茨海默病诊断等应用中验证，证明该方法能从不同物种的原始EEG信号中提取生物意义模式，自主选择高质量通道，并实现稳健泛化。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习范式通过创新的架构和损失设计，能够有效处理EEG信号分析中的关键挑战，在多个应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

### [13] [Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with explicit domain rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20501)
*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一种规则引导的多模态聚类框架，通过将领域特定约束嵌入到表示学习过程中，结合VAE架构和LLM生成的规则知识图谱，实现更有意义和可解释的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。需要一种能够直接整合领域特定约束的聚类方法。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规。规则由LLM生成并结构化到知识图谱中。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生了更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但面临LLM规则幻觉、规则冲突和可扩展性等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆技术，结合稀疏注意力和状态空间模型(SSM)的优点

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的算法，能够有效解决注意力机制中的二次方复杂度问题

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度学习方法来预测混凝土中时间相关的全场损伤。该方法使用自回归U-Net模型预测给定微观结构几何形状和收缩剖面演化下的标量损伤场演化，并通过CNN预测关键力学性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全场损伤评估计算量大，需要开发更高效的方法来优化混凝土配合比设计，提高耐久性并减少内部损伤。

Method: 采用双网络架构：自回归U-Net模型用于预测损伤场演化，CNN用于基于损伤估计预测力学性能（收缩和残余刚度）。

Result: 该方法在合成数据集上表现出高计算效率和稳健的预测性能，显著降低了传统全场损伤评估的计算负荷。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于深入了解骨料特性（形状、尺寸和分布）与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系，可优化混凝土配合比设计。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

TL;DR: 本文提出用复杂性奖励替代传统的熵奖励，通过结合香农熵和失衡度来平衡随机性和结构性，从而改进策略梯度方法的探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵最大化方法将策略推向均匀随机分布，这种探索策略缺乏结构且效率低下。作者希望开发更鲁棒的探索机制，鼓励策略在保持随机性的同时具备结构性。

Method: 提出复杂性驱动策略优化（CDPO）算法，用复杂性奖励替代PPO中的熵奖励。复杂性定义为香农熵与失衡度的乘积，失衡度量化策略与均匀分布的距离。

Result: 在多个离散动作空间任务上的实验表明，CDPO相比PPO对复杂性系数的选择更加鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 复杂性奖励能够有效平衡探索和利用，引导智能体发现结构化且适应性强的策略，比传统熵奖励更具优势。

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析基于确定性扩散模型的逆问题求解算法，将扩散先验算法解释为具有变化投影的广义投影梯度下降方法，并在满足受限等距性质的条件下推导了收敛速率。


<details>

Motivation: 虽然生成扩散模型在逆问题中表现出强大的数据驱动先验能力，但严格的恢复保证仍然有限。本文旨在为基于扩散的逆问题求解算法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 研究确定性版本的Kadkhodaie & Simoncelli算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将扩散先验算法建模为具有变化投影的广义投影梯度下降方法。

Result: 当感知矩阵在模型集上满足受限等距性质时，可以推导出明确依赖噪声调度方案的定量收敛速率。在低维紧凸集和低秩高斯混合模型等数据分布上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了理论保证，即使在非凸模型集（如低秩高斯混合模型）下也能建立全局收敛保证。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Method: 开发MDBench框架，在噪声变化条件下评估12种算法对14个PDE和63个ODE的发现能力，评估指标包括导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度。

Result: 线性方法和遗传编程方法分别在PDE和ODE上获得最低预测误差，线性模型对噪声更鲁棒，同时发现了当前方法在流体动力学和热力学PDE系统中的关键局限性。

Conclusion: MDBench通过提供严格的、可扩展的基准测试框架和丰富的动力系统数据集，加速了模型发现方法的发展，支持系统性的评估、比较和改进。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPC模型虽然具有可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模块容易受到对抗攻击的影响，可能危及最终预测结果。

Method: 提出RNPC方法，通过新颖的类级集成推理机制，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。

Result: 理论分析证明RNPC比NPC具有更好的对抗鲁棒性，实验结果显示RNPC在图像分类任务上优于现有概念瓶颈模型。

Conclusion: RNPC是第一个针对识别模块对抗攻击的鲁棒神经概率电路，在保持良性输入高精度的同时显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了两种混合分类器（XGBoost+随机森林 vs SVM+逻辑回归）在糖尿病风险分层中的性能，并在外部队列上评估了它们的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超过5.37亿人，预计到2045年将达到7.83亿。早期风险分层可以从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建了两种混合分类器：(i) XGBoost+随机森林 (XGB-RF) 和 (ii) SVM+逻辑回归 (SVM-LR)。使用防泄漏的标准化流程，在主要数据集上训练并冻结模型，然后在PIMA队列上进行外部验证。

Result: 在主要数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC ~0.995，AUPRC ~0.998）优于SVM-LR（AUROC ~0.978，AUPRC ~0.947）。在外部PIMA队列上，XGB-RF仍保持强劲性能（AUROC ~0.990，AUPRC ~0.959），而SVM-LR性能较低。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，表现出较小的外部性能衰减和可接受的校准。支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健、可转移方法。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域生成能力强但常违反物理定律，现有方法依赖DPS式值函数近似导致误差和训练不稳定

Method: PIRF方法：计算轨迹级奖励直接反向传播梯度，采用分层截断反向传播和基于权重的正则化策略提高样本效率和数据保真度

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下始终实现更优的物理约束执行效果

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有潜力，PIRF为物理约束生成提供了新视角

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文对贝叶斯神经网络(BNN)的超参数进行了全局敏感性分析，揭示了超参数对预测准确性和不确定性量化(UQ)的影响，并建议使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化来改进BNN在实际应用中的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络虽然能提供预测不确定性量化，但在实践中由于近似训练方法和超参数选择的复杂性，难以获得准确的不确定性量化。超参数数量多且影响不透明，需要系统分析其影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下系统评估BNN的性能表现，分析超参数之间的相互作用对预测准确性和不确定性量化的影响。

Result: 研究发现许多超参数之间存在相互作用，共同影响BNN的预测准确性和不确定性量化性能。超参数的选择对BNN的实际应用效果至关重要。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法来进行维度约简和超参数选择，以确保BNN能够提供准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难选择：离散化再优化方法内存成本高，优化再离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有的代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度精度，但在复杂模型和大步长下往往不稳定。

Conclusion: EES方案成功解决了神经SDE训练中的内存效率与梯度精度之间的权衡问题，为复杂模型和大步长下的稳定训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Conclusion: 扩散模型可以有效地用于互信息估计，提供了一种直接且可扩展的方法，在多个测试场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架成功解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和可泛化的分层策略提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Twins提出了一个统一的数学框架，通过在潜在空间中创建隐藏代理来统一表示学习和算法求解方法，将经典建模、反演、模型约简和算子逼近都视为单一原理的特例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习在过去十年中取得了显著进展，但表示学习和算法求解方法往往并行发展，缺乏统一的数学框架。作者希望建立一个能够桥接数据驱动表示学习和经典科学建模的统一框架。

Method: Latent Twins框架在潜在空间中为底层方程创建隐藏代理，类似于数字孪生在数字世界中镜像物理系统，Latent Twins在学习的潜在空间中镜像数学系统。该方法适用于ODE和PDE，通过算子控制潜在空间。

Result: 在三个代表性设置中验证了框架：(i)典型ODE捕获不同动态机制；(ii)PDE基准测试使用浅水方程，与DeepONet和4D-Var基线对比；(iii)真实地理位势再分析数据集，从稀疏噪声观测中重建和预测。Latent Twins提供了紧凑、可解释的代理算子。

Conclusion: Latent Twins提供了一个可扩展、理论基础的代理框架，能够桥接数据驱动的表示学习和跨学科的经典科学建模，同时保持与同化、控制和不确定性量化等科学管道的兼容性。

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多轮任务规划中面临的稀疏奖励、长时程信用分配和强化学习计算开销等挑战。

Method: 将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，使用专家轨迹的密集可验证奖励进行GRPO策略优化。

Result: 1.5B参数模型在超过30步的长时程规划任务上达到70%成功率，优于14B基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了多轮任务的成功率，还展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，复杂任务训练的模型能成功完成所有更简单的子任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

TL;DR: 提出了个性化联邦字典学习（PFedDL）框架，用于解决多站点fMRI研究中的数据隐私和站点异质性挑战，通过分解站点特定字典为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件来实现协作建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多站点功能磁共振成像研究中，数据隐私约束和站点特定异质性导致非独立同分布数据，阻碍了可泛化模型的开发。

Method: PFedDL在每个站点进行独立字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件。全局原子通过联邦聚合更新以促进跨站点一致性，本地原子独立优化以捕捉站点特定变异性。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非独立同分布数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架有效解决了多站点神经影像分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，为协作建模提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有好奇心机制在MARL中往往将环境随机性误认为有意义的新颖性，且忽视了同伴行为新颖性所编码的潜在任务动态，导致去中心化无通信MARL设置中的次优探索

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴自适应校准探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架，让智能体能够鲁棒地过滤噪声惊喜信号，并通过动态校准内在好奇心与推断的多智能体上下文来指导探索

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，使用CERMIC的探索在稀疏奖励环境中显著优于最先进算法

Conclusion: CERMIC通过理论上有依据的内在奖励，鼓励智能体探索具有高信息增益的状态转换，有效解决了MARL中稀疏奖励环境下的探索挑战

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算（如耦合簇方法）时的资源预测问题，帮助用户在提交实验前了解最优参数配置，避免资源浪费。

Method: 使用梯度提升（GB）机器学习模型和主动学习策略，基于CCSD应用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上的运行时参数值集合进行训练和评估。

Result: 在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，梯度提升模型在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）分别为0.023和0.073；主动学习策略仅需约450个实验数据点即可达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效预测化学计算资源需求，梯度提升模型表现优异，主动学习策略在数据收集成本高时具有显著优势，为超级计算机用户提供了实用的资源优化工具。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要建立理论框架来指导实践中的提示长度选择

Method: 基于固定高维次高斯表示建立了ICL稳定性的非渐近下界，提出了具有一次性校准的两阶段可观测估计器，无需分布先验即可生成实用的提示长度估计

Result: 实验表明预测阈值与经验拐点紧密对齐，理论作为保守但可靠的上界，校准变体进一步缩小了差距

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，弥合了理论与部署之间的鸿沟，提高了大规模提示在有限样本机制下的可解释性和可靠性

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport（双谱最优传输），这是一种对称感知的离散OT扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，能够在保持信号结构的同时去除群作用带来的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征之间几何距离的OT对齐可能会忽略数据的内在相干结构。传统OT方法无法有效处理对称变换带来的冗余变化。

Method: 引入Bispectral Optimal Transport方法，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示能够保留所有信号结构，同时仅去除由群作用引起的变化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，与原始特征OT相比，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划实现了更高的类别保持准确性，改善了能够捕获数据集底层语义标签结构的有意义对应关系的质量。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够有效去除不影响类别或内容的冗余变化，同时保留重要的语义结构，为对称性数据处理提供了更优的传输对齐方法。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现联邦学习框架下的大语言模型微调仍存在数据泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，且模型越大泄露风险越高。作者还提出了针对FL的增强攻击策略，并评估了多种隐私保护技术。

Motivation: 虽然联邦学习被认为是保护隐私的协作训练框架，但现有研究假设全局模型只包含泛化知识从而保护隐私。本文旨在验证在联邦学习环境下微调大语言模型是否真的能保护客户数据隐私。

Method: 通过大量实验验证数据泄露风险，包括使用简单的生成方法从全局模型提取训练数据，并开发了针对FL的增强攻击策略（跟踪训练过程中的全局模型更新）。同时评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者仍能从全局模型中提取训练数据，数据泄露风险随模型规模增大而增加。增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄露。隐私保护技术能在一定程度上降低风险。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架下微调大语言模型存在显著隐私风险，需要采用适当的隐私保护措施。研究结果为在FL中训练LLM时降低隐私风险提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在训练过程中会丢弃低概率token的梯度信号，但这些信号对调节熵动态具有关键作用。需要一种能够保留这些梯度并控制熵稳定的方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制成功解决了RL训练LLMs时的熵控制问题，为复杂推理任务的优化提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部，推导出超额风险的幂律关系，并在有界可逆变换、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构等多种场景下验证该定律的普适性

Result: 发现学习曲线的斜率不是普遍常数，而是依赖于数据冗余度，更陡峭的谱会加速规模收益。建立了缩放定律在NTK和特征学习机制下的统一理论框架

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其视为有限样本冗余定律，统一了经验观察与理论基础

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)进行超参数敏感性评估，分析不同架构深度对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GAN和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高。研究旨在评估超参数选择对数据质量和计算性能的敏感性，为硬件受限用户提供实用指导。

Method: 在两个工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型设置，从运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两工具都能获得高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer与轻量级LLM结合提供了最佳平衡，在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在上限。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效的自适应学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提高了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上效率很高，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化，延迟完全重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上评估显示，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提高高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的自适应技术有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能问题，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MLP和CNN的时间序列预测模型，使用MLP捕捉长期趋势，CNN处理局部变化，并引入IConv架构独立处理通道依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳性，MLP模型在捕捉长期依赖方面表现优异但忽略局部变化，CNN能有效处理局部模式但计算成本高。

Method: 结合MLP和CNN，MLP建模整体趋势，CNN使用多样化核函数捕捉局部模式，提出IConv架构独立处理通道依赖关系并降低计算成本。

Result: 在时间序列数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多元时间序列预测方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: MLP与CNN的结合能有效处理时间序列的非平稳特性，IConv架构提高了模型性能并降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）进行优先级排序，无需大量超参数调优或干净验证集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在噪声标签和数据异质性存在下训练深度神经网络的挑战，提升模型在噪声环境下的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数动态调整每个训练样本的损失权重，基于样本难度进行自适应优先级排序。在每个训练小批量后，使用验证集上的单个小批量梯度下降步骤更新权重。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数及架构上的广泛实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，且不依赖大量数据增强或高级正则化技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务依赖初始化（TDI）框架，通过功率谱匹配方法使状态空间模型（SSMs）的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特性对齐，显著提高了模型的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。状态空间模型等基础序列模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：功率谱匹配，在大型训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著改善了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，首个关注鲁棒性公平性的无数据鲁棒性蒸馏方法，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来改善不同类别间的鲁棒性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据鲁棒性蒸馏方法忽视了鲁棒性公平性问题，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性存在显著差异，学生模型在不同攻击目标下的鲁棒性不稳定。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，生成公平感知示例(FAEs)通过特征级预测均匀性约束，并构建均匀目标对抗示例(UTAEs)避免偏向性攻击方向。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下实现了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性（如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2，FGSM和AutoAttack的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升15.1%和6.4%）。

Conclusion: FERD在鲁棒性和公平性方面均表现出优越性能，为解决无数据鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个fMRI生成框架，通过时频表示和去噪扩散模型解决fMRI数据获取资源密集的问题，能够生成高质量的BOLD信号数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据获取资源密集，高质量样本有限，现有生成模型难以捕捉BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态特性。

Method: 将BOLD信号通过时变傅里叶变换转换为窗口化频谱图，使用无分类器去噪扩散模型生成类条件频谱图，再通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在基于fMRI的脑网络分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架能够有效生成高质量的fMRI数据，为数据驱动的脑分析模型提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的情境感知时间序列字幕基准，包含46.5万训练和10.5万测试时间戳，整合了数值序列、元数据、线图图像和字幕，并提供了新的评估指标和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列字幕基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的字幕，且忽略了元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集重构为字幕和问答任务，采用可扩展的管道生成参考字幕：大部分由oracle LLM生成并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证，同时提供579个人工修订的测试字幕。

Result: 建立了CaTS-Bench基准和字幕管道，为时间序列分析和基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕管道为未来研究提供了坚实的基础，同时揭示了当前视觉语言模型在时间序列推理方面的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了类内方差收缩的核心作用，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段训练框架来解决多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，通过单模态训练塑造初始状态，引入有效竞争强度(ECS)概念，并开发了基于互信息和部分信息分解的诊断度量FastPID以及异步训练控制器。

Motivation: 多模态融合中常出现模态竞争问题，即某个模态主导学习过程而其他模态优化不足。现有方法大多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，但忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 1) 提出有效竞争强度(ECS)概念量化模态竞争力；2) 开发FastPID方法进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；3) 设计异步训练控制器动态平衡模态并定位理想初始状态。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，证明了在融合前塑造模型初始状态是缓解模态竞争的有效策略。

Conclusion: 通过单模态训练塑造预融合模型的初始状态是一种强大策略，能够在竞争开始前就缓解问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，未来可集成到可穿戴FHR监测设备中，实现更早、更鲁棒的风险检测

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

TL;DR: 提出Federated Markov Imputation (FMI)方法，用于解决电子健康记录联邦学习中因不同ICU时间粒度差异导致的数据缺失问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录联邦学习中存在数据缺失挑战，特别是当不同机构收集时间序列数据的时态粒度不一致时

Method: FMI是一种隐私保护方法，允许ICU协作构建全局转移模型进行时间插补

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的脓毒症发病预测任务中，FMI优于局部插补基线方法，特别是在ICU采样间隔不规则的场景下

Conclusion: FMI方法能有效处理联邦学习中因时间粒度差异导致的数据缺失问题，提升预测性能

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic
health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at
varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov
Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units
(ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal
imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using
the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

TL;DR: StyleBench是一个系统评估不同推理风格在多样化任务和模型上表现的基准，发现没有单一最优推理风格，策略效果高度依赖于模型规模和任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的效果受推理策略影响很大，但推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 评估了五种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在五个推理任务上，使用15个开源模型（270M到120B参数），涵盖主要模型家族。

Result: 搜索类方法在开放性问题表现优异但需要大规模模型，简洁风格在定义明确任务上效率高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测，推理鲁棒性随规模增长。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于特定约束选择最优推理策略提供了重要路线图，并开源了基准测试工具。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

TL;DR: 本文研究了POMDP中随机传感器延迟问题，提出了一个基于模型的延迟感知框架，通过顺序更新信念状态来处理乱序到达的观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常存在延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是瞬时的。本文针对观测可能乱序到达的随机传感器延迟问题进行研究。

Method: 提出基于模型的滤波过程，顺序更新信念状态；引入延迟感知框架整合到基于模型的强化学习中；在Dreamer算法上应用该框架。

Result: 方法在延迟分布变化时表现出鲁棒性，在模拟机器人任务中优于为MDP设计的延迟感知基线方法和常见实用启发式方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模观测延迟对于处理随机传感器延迟至关重要，提出的框架能有效提升强化学习在延迟环境中的性能。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [59] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过控制标签分布来缓解数据不平衡问题，实验证明该方法在局部和全局不平衡场景下都能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法主要通过客户端选择来缓解这一问题，但缺乏对标签分布控制的系统研究。

Method: 提出分布控制的客户端选择方法，选择能使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）最对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 在三种常见FL策略和两个数据集上的实验表明，面对局部不平衡时与平衡分布对齐效果最好，面对全局不平衡时与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 分布控制的客户端选择能有效提升联邦学习性能，针对不同类型的不平衡问题需要采用不同的目标分布策略。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习的注意力增强LSTM模型，用于ICU中脓毒症发病的早期预测，支持可变预测窗口，在保护患者隐私的同时提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症早期准确预测对ICU患者预后至关重要，但单个医院数据有限且隐私保护要求限制了机器学习模型的效果。联邦学习可以解决数据共享的隐私问题。

Method: 使用联邦学习框架训练注意力增强的LSTM模型，支持可变预测窗口（短期和长期预测），在多中心ICU数据上进行协作训练。

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高了整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），而且特别有利于脓毒症的早期检测。可变预测窗口在不显著影响性能的情况下减少了计算和通信开销。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的前提下有效提升了脓毒症预测的准确性和时效性，为ICU临床决策提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Motivation: 为离散扩散模型开发确定性反向过程，替代传统的随机去噪过程，无需重新训练或连续状态嵌入

Method: 使用马尔可夫链和弱混沌动态的herding算法变体来实现确定性离散状态转换，直接替换随机去噪过程

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中实现了效率和样本质量的一致提升

Conclusion: 这种简单的确定性化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，并证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间中也同样有效

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微观流动性特征如何增强细粒度时空犯罪预测的准确性，探索深度学习在犯罪预测中的潜力

Method: 使用ConvLSTM网络，结合犯罪数据、社会人口数据和流动性数据，在四个美国城市进行12小时犯罪预测，并与基线模型比较

Result: 流动性特征显著提升预测性能，特别是短输入序列时。流动性+社会人口特征组合效果最佳，深度学习模型在所有城市都表现最优

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据源对时空犯罪预测至关重要，深度学习在细粒度时空尺度上具有优势但也存在局限性

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Motivation: 提高重型土方设备（特别是挖掘设备臂架）中线性执行器的能源效率，减少能量损失和环境影响。

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink进行液压回路仿真，比较传统PDCV方案与创新的PFCV方案（在作动器两端设置人工泄漏）。采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器实现位置控制。

Result: PFCV方案通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失，比传统PDCV方案能效提高8.5%。仿真结果与实验数据一致。

Conclusion: 提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，从而降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不合理或不直观，需要开发能够产生更合理、更用户友好的反事实解释的方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，整合了对比学习和分类一致性目标、基于原型的初始化以及真实性约束优化。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据集上，GenFacts在合理性方面优于最先进基线方法18.7%，在人类研究中获得最高的可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和以用户为中心的可解释性比稀疏性更重要。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过实验发现，在时间序列预测中，Transformer架构常常退化为简单的MLP，注意力机制未能按预期工作，主要原因是当前的嵌入方法无法让Transformer在结构良好的潜在空间中运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中表现不佳甚至不如简单线性基线。大多数研究未能深入探索Transformer失败的原因，因此需要系统分析时间序列Transformer的工作机制。

Method: 设计了一系列渐进式实验，将Transformer逐步修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；创建了可解释的数据集来分析注意力机制失败的原因；进行了理论分析探讨嵌入方法失效的深层原因。

Result: 发现现有的时间序列Transformer中，Transformer块经常退化为简单的MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前的嵌入方法无法为Transformer提供结构良好的潜在空间。

Conclusion: 时间序列Transformer性能不佳的根本原因在于嵌入方法的失效，这阻碍了注意力机制的有效运作，导致模型退化为MLP。需要重新设计适合时间序列特性的嵌入方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦值注意力（DVA）机制，用于改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs）在高维回归任务中的性能，使其能够更有效地替代高斯过程进行快速物理系统建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中处理高维回归任务时效果有限，需要一种更有效的注意力机制来匹配高斯过程的特性，即函数空间完全由输入核表征且预测均值是训练目标的加权和。

Method: 提出解耦值注意力（DVA），仅从输入计算相似度，通过值传播标签，镜像高斯过程更新但保持无核特性。研究表明注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素。

Result: 局部化注意力在不同维度设置下持续降低PFNs的样本外验证损失，5维和10维情况下验证损失降低超过50%。CNN-based PFNs性能可与Transformer-based相媲美。64维功率流方程近似平均绝对误差达到1E-3量级，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: DVA注意力机制是提升PFNs性能的关键，能够有效替代计算密集型的高斯过程推理，为高维物理系统建模提供高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Motivation: 发现flow matching在低噪声区域存在病理性问题，小扰动会导致速度目标的大变化，影响优化和语义表示质量

Method: 提出LCF混合训练协议，在小噪声水平用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，在中等和高噪声水平保留标准flow matching

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理性问题对于充分发挥flow matching在生成和表示学习中的潜力至关重要

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但不同图表示（如AIG与XMG）之间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术，交叉视图上下文被感知为噪声

Method: 引入MixGate框架，基于原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教授模型共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标，利用对齐视图作为丰富的互补信号

Result: 大量实验（包括关键消融研究）表明，对齐优先策略将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是释放多视图自监督力量的必要前提条件，MixGate通过先对齐后建模的课程学习策略成功解决了多视图布尔电路学习的融合挑战

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Motivation: 个性化医疗需要基于患者个人基因和环境因素优化治疗方案，但无法随意测试候选治疗方法的有效性。现有替代模型在处理未见过的患者-治疗组合时泛化能力不足，需要利用领域特定先验知识来提供更有意义的治疗适应性信号。

Method: 提出LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON)方法，通过'优化提示'实现，将LLMs作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，无需任务特定微调，利用LLMs处理非结构化领域知识的能力。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，能够有效利用LLMs和领域知识来优化个性化治疗方案，展示了在医疗决策支持中的潜力。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Method: 提出CLUE框架：1）使用机制可解释性技术识别遗忘和保留电路；2）将电路转换为合取范式；3）根据可满足性解确定神经元应遗忘还是保留；4）为不同类别神经元提供针对性微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，相比现有定位方法，CLUE通过精确的神经元定位实现了更优的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架能够有效解决神经元纠缠问题，通过区分遗忘和保留电路实现更精确的LLM遗忘。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

TL;DR: FracAug是一个创新的图级异常检测增强框架，通过生成语义一致的图变体和互验证伪标签来解决图神经网络在数据不平衡和标注成本高的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域很重要，但高标注成本和数据不平衡限制了图神经网络的性能

Method: FracAug通过学习图内语义并合成分数变体，使用加权距离感知边界损失来生成多样化的语义保持图，然后利用原始图和增强图的预测结果进行伪标注，迭代扩展训练集

Result: 在12个真实数据集和14种GNN上的实验表明，FracAug能显著提升性能，平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提高5.72%、7.23%和4.18%

Conclusion: FracAug作为模型无关的模块具有出色的通用性和有效性，能够显著提升图级异常检测性能

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

TL;DR: LCR是一个实用的基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法增强LRU缓存策略，在准确预测时实现接近最优性能，在预测不准确时优雅降级到接近LRU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，推荐模型中的嵌入命中率和LLM中的KV缓存未命中严重影响性能。现有的启发式策略（如LRU）在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而基于学习的方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或设计保守收益有限的问题。

Method: LCR框架的核心算法LARU通过机器学习预测增强LRU缓存策略，并通过在线错误估计动态适应预测准确性。当预测准确时实现接近最优性能，预测不准确时优雅降级到LRU水平。

Result: 实验表明，在DLRM和LLM场景中，LCR将吞吐量提升高达24.2%，P99 TTFT降低高达28.3%，优于广泛使用的推理系统。即使在预测不佳的情况下，性能仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域弥合了实证进展与理论进展之间的差距，提供了性能增益同时确保鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球普及度低，导致许多本可挽救的生命流失。需要开发基于电子健康记录的便捷筛查方法。

Method: 使用数百万电子健康记录建立医疗代码序列预训练的扩展定律，预训练计算最优的基础模型（最高24亿参数），并在临床医生策划的癌症风险预测队列上进行微调。

Result: 在3万患者回顾性评估中，CATCH-FM达到60%敏感性和99%特异性，显著优于基于特征的树模型和通用/医疗大语言模型。在EHRSHOT少样本排行榜上实现胰腺癌风险预测最先进性能。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在各种患者分布中表现出鲁棒性，在ICD代码空间操作具有优势，能够捕获非平凡的癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在截断伊辛模型中仅使用单个样本估计逆温度参数的问题，这是对传统需要大量样本的统计估计方法的挑战，特别是在高维统计和机器学习中具有重要应用价值。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的估计方法，将Daskalakis等人和Galanis等人的技术推广到更复杂的截断伊辛模型设置中，算法时间复杂度接近O(n)。

Result: 设计了一个估计器β̂，在k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³的条件下，该估计器与真实参数β*具有O(Δ³/√n)的一致性，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将伪似然最大化技术扩展到截断伊辛模型，为高维统计推断提供了有效的单样本估计解决方案，特别是在图结构约束和截断条件下表现出良好的理论性质。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为二进制自编码器（BAE）的新方法，通过最小化小批量隐藏激活的熵来增强LLM特征提取的稀疏性和独立性，解决了现有方法中特征密集化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解构LLM隐藏状态的特征时，通常依赖于对单个训练实例的隐式正则化（如L1归一化、top-k函数等），缺乏对实例间全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化。

Method: 提出二进制自编码器（BAE），通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，并应用梯度估计实现反向传播，从而在小批量隐藏激活上强制执行最小熵，促进特征独立性和跨实例稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两方面表现出色：能够可靠估计二进制隐藏激活的熵，用于表征LLM的推理动态和上下文学习；在特征提取方面，BAE避免了密集特征，同时产生最多可解释特征，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器，通过熵最小化有效提升了LLM特征提取的稀疏性和可解释性，为理解LLM机制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

TL;DR: 提出Local-UID方案和ColorGNN/ColorUID方法，解决GNN在整数线性规划中表达能力和泛化能力的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名GNN在ILP问题上表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符方法又会导致虚假相关性，损害泛化能力

Method: 基于d跳唯一性着色的Local-UID方案，确保标识符仅在节点d跳邻域内唯一；ColorGNN通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息，ColorUID是轻量级特征级变体

Result: 实验证明该方法在三个ILP基准上取得显著提升，在线性规划数据集上表现出强OOD泛化能力，并能进一步提升图级任务性能

Conclusion: Local-UID方案在保持全局UID表达能力的同时提供更强的泛化能力，是解决GNN在ILP优化中表达-泛化权衡的有效方法

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估（预测、插补、异常检测、分类）主要关注任务特定性能，无法严格衡量模型是否捕获数据的完整生成分布

Method: 引入无损压缩评估框架TSCom-Bench，建立标准化评估协议和指标，将时间序列模型作为压缩骨干网络进行快速适配

Result: 在多样化数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等先进模型的实验表明，压缩能揭示传统基准忽略的分布弱点

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有时间序列建模评估方法

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解当前空中交通流至关重要，但面临建模个体飞机行为和复杂交互关系的挑战，同时需要生成可解释的预测结果。

Method: MAIFormer框架包含两个核心注意力模块：掩码多变量注意力（捕捉个体飞机的时空模式）和智能体注意力（建模多智能体在复杂空中交通场景中的社会模式）。

Result: 在韩国仁川国际机场终端空域的真实ADS-B飞行轨迹数据集上评估，MAIFormer在多个指标上达到最佳性能，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅性能优越，还能从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和空中交通控制的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究上下文学习（ICL）机制，发现在零样本场景下语言模型会将查询编码为非选择性表示，包含所有可能任务的信息，导致输出任意且准确率接近零。通过低秩滤波器选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息可以有效引导模型朝向目标任务。研究发现少样本ICL有效模拟了这种任务导向的信息移除过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部工作机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过信息移除的视角来揭示ICL的机制。

Method: 通过设计精心设计的指标测量隐藏状态，观察ICL如何选择性移除冗余信息。识别出诱导移除操作的关键注意力头（去噪头），并通过阻断信息移除操作的消融实验验证机制。

Result: 研究发现少样本ICL有效模拟任务导向的信息移除过程，选择性移除纠缠的非选择性表示中的冗余信息。当阻断信息移除操作时，ICL准确率显著下降，特别是在正确标签不在少样本演示中的情况下。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，去噪头在其中发挥关键作用，这为理解ICL的工作机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

TL;DR: rBridge是一种利用小模型（≤1B）预测大模型推理能力的方法，通过将预训练目标与目标任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为标签，显著降低了数据集排名的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练大语言模型的成本过高，需要利用小代理模型来优化数据集，但推理能力通常只在超过7B参数的大模型中可靠出现，因此需要一种方法让小模型也能有效预测大模型的推理表现。

Method: rBridge通过加权负对数似然与任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小代理模型更接近预训练目标和目标任务。

Result: rBridge将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上，在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性，并在1B到7B规模上实现了预测关系的零样本跨预训练数据集迁移。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

Conclusion: DELTA提供了一个清晰的测试平台，用于探索RL驱动推理的极限，理解模型如何超越现有先验来获取新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

### [83] [Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021)
*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-CIT是一个基于分治策略的集成条件独立性测试框架，通过将数据划分为子集并聚合p值来显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持理论一致性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于约束的因果发现方法依赖大量条件独立性测试(CITs)，但计算成本过高，特别是CITs本身的时间复杂度随样本量增加而急剧上升，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出E-CIT框架：将数据划分为子集，在每个子集上独立应用基础CIT，然后基于稳定分布特性设计新颖的p值聚合方法。该方法将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本量的线性水平。

Result: 实验结果表明，E-CIT不仅显著降低了CITs和因果发现的计算负担，而且在复杂测试场景下表现出竞争力，特别是在真实世界数据集上展现出改进效果。

Conclusion: E-CIT为条件独立性测试提供了一个通用、即插即用的高效解决方案，解决了因果发现中的关键计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA)框架，消除显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，简化训练过程并保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策敏感；扩散模型虽能表达多模态行为但带来额外设计负担

Method: 通过噪声级critic的梯度场直接生成动作，无需显式actor网络，将策略改进与critic最新价值估计紧密对齐

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和扩散方法获得更优的学习曲线和竞争性性能

Conclusion: ACA提供了一个简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个简单有效的管道，用于大规模创建困难数学问题，通过自适应思维模型识别现有数据集中的难题，并训练专门的难题生成器，显著提升大推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展数学问题生成方面面临高计算/API成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限的挑战，需要一种更高效的方式来大规模创建困难问题。

Method: 提出ScaleDiff管道：1）使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题；2）在过滤的困难数据上训练专门的难题生成器（DiffGen-8B）；3）在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct上微调后，相比原始数据集性能提升11.3%，在AIME'24等五个困难基准测试中平均准确率达到65.9%，超越了OpenThinker3等强模型。使用成本效益高的Qwen3-8B作为教师模型，成功转移了高级推理能力。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能够有效扩展困难问题的创建，无需复杂提示和高API成本，并观察到随着困难问题数量增加，模型在困难基准测试上的性能呈现明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了视觉越狱攻击在跨模型转移中的局限性，发现攻击位于高锐度区域，对参数变化敏感。提出了FORCE方法，通过修正特征过度依赖来改善攻击的跨模型可转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效操纵开源MLLMs，但在跨模型转移到闭源MLLMs时效果有限，需要解决攻击可转移性问题。

Method: 提出FORCE方法：分析攻击在中间层和频谱域的特征表示，修正对窄层表示和语义贫乏频率分量的过度依赖，引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域。

Result: 实验表明FORCE方法能有效改善视觉越狱攻击的跨模型可转移性，提升对闭源MLLMs的红队评估效果。

Conclusion: 通过消除对层和频谱特征的非泛化依赖，FORCE方法能够发现平坦的可行区域，显著提高视觉越狱攻击的跨模型转移能力。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过边缘归因修补技术研究了RL微调对LLMs内部机制的影响，发现在线RL训练会增强激活强度和多样性，而DPO方法则表现出不同的内部变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL微调被证明能提升LLMs能力，但其对不同模型内部机制的具体影响尚不明确，需要系统性的分析来理解RL微调的工作原理。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补(EAP)技术，对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部激活差异，重点关注PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同RL方法的效果。

Result: 在线RL训练导致两个稳健效应：激活强度整体增加和激活模式多样性提高；而DPO微调则显示出较弱或不一致的内部变化。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性来提升泛化能力，不同RL方法在内部机制改变上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

Conclusion: 几何指称表达理解是几何问题求解的重要基础能力，在GeoRef上训练的模型能显著提升下游几何推理任务的性能，凸显了该任务对多模态数学理解的价值。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

TL;DR: SPREAD是一个基于去噪扩散概率模型(DDPMs)的生成式框架，用于高效解决大规模昂贵多目标优化问题，通过条件扩散过程和自适应多梯度下降更新来快速收敛并保持多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效的多目标优化方法来计算冲突目标之间的帕累托最优解集仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是对于大规模和昂贵的问题。

Method: SPREAD首先学习决策空间采样点的条件扩散过程，然后在每个反向扩散步骤中，通过使用自适应多梯度下降启发的更新进行快速收敛，并结合基于高斯RBF的排斥项来保持多样性。

Result: 在多目标优化基准测试（包括离线和基于贝叶斯代理的设置）上的实证结果表明，SPREAD在效率、可扩展性和帕累托前沿覆盖方面匹配或超过了领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: SPREAD框架为大规模昂贵多目标优化问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，展示了扩散模型在此类问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Motivation: 传统图域自适应方法主要关注节点属性变换和对齐，但往往忽视了图结构异质性，导致分布对齐效果不佳。

Conclusion: 理论证明SATMC能获得更紧的跨网络节点分类误差界，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The
code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合注意力机制，结合了naive和absorb两种方法的优势，在MLA架构中实现了高达3倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA注意力机制在解码阶段使用absorb方法虽然减少了HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法充分利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀）。

Method: TyphoonMLA采用混合方法：对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式来利用共享前缀，对非共享部分使用absorb公式来减少带宽需求。

Result: 在NPU和GPU上，TyphoonMLA将MLA架构的注意力计算吞吐量分别提升了3倍和3.24倍，HBM大小仅增加3%的开销。

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过巧妙结合两种注意力计算方法，有效解决了MLA架构在解码阶段的性能瓶颈，为LLM的高效推理提供了重要优化方案。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Method: 生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，控制结构属性如同质性和度分布，实现对分布偏移的鲁棒性测试。

Result: 基准测试显示传导性能不能预测归纳泛化能力，鲁棒性对模型架构和初始图机制高度敏感。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中耗时且需要大量交互步骤，而现有的视觉语言动作策略在低级控制方面性能有限，通常需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习智能体提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。建议的动作增加了样本多样性。

Result: 在不同环境和智能体设置下的评估结果表明，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在现实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越关键词黑名单或简单启发式方法，攻击者使用多模态策略结合自然语言文本、混淆URL、伪造头部和恶意附件，传统检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应。

Method: EvoMail构建统一异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用LLM增强的认知图神经网络进行上下文感知推理；采用对抗性自进化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Result: 理论分析表明稀疏投影能减少对抗性杠杆作用，实验证明SPCA在强白盒和黑盒攻击下比PCA表现更好，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 稀疏主成分分析通过减少投影的稀疏性来降低对抗攻击的敏感性，这一机制在理论和实验中都得到了验证，为对抗防御提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出LAVA方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的潜在空间结构，通过分析局部邻域内的特征相关性来揭示输入特征与嵌入空间组织之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型虽然能驱动科学发现，但难以解释。现有解释方法要么过于细粒度（单样本级），要么过于简化（数据集级），缺乏基于潜在空间邻近性的自动化策略来关联相似样本。

Method: LAVA是一种后处理、模型无关的方法，将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过分析原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，并揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 基于MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入，LAVA能够捕捉相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA方法能够有效解释无监督学习中的局部嵌入组织，为理解黑盒模型的潜在空间结构提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了GRPO强化学习算法在特定假设下会诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型，并提出了λ-GRPO改进算法来缓解原始GRPO目标中的缺陷，从而在保持训练成本不变的情况下提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法中隐含的过程奖励模型结构，探索是否可以利用这种内置结构来替代昂贵的显式定义过程奖励模型，以更低的成本提升模型性能。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO算法在特定序列重叠假设下会诱导非平凡PRM，然后通过实证验证这些假设在实际条件下成立。基于GRPO-as-a-PRM框架，识别出GRPO目标的缺陷，并提出λ-GRPO改进算法。

Result: 实验表明，使用λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上的表现均优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可以利用GRPO算法中隐藏的内置PRM结构来提升模型性能，而无需依赖昂贵的显式定义过程奖励模型，这对GRPO的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，通过多模态分词策略解决传统LLM分词器在CAD序列处理中的语义丢失问题，显著提升文本引导CAD原型设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD的原始语义和几何结构，限制了文本引导CAD原型设计的发展。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，采用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑、原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: CAD-Tokenizer在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中显著改善了指令遵循和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上均优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略与CAD结构特性对齐，为文本引导CAD原型设计提供了更有效的表示方法，推动了整个设计流程的优化。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRCD是一个基于相对上下文差异(RCD)预训练范式的时序异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口的显著差异来识别异常，而非传统的重构方法，在零样本检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于重构的时序异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常且容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出相对上下文差异(RCD)预训练范式，使用标准Transformer架构训练模型检测相邻时间窗口的差异，并构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时序异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式为构建稳健且可泛化的时序异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DATS（Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling）的新方法，用于解决持续学习中的校准问题，通过距离感知的温度缩放来适应不同任务间的差异，从而提高模型在所有任务上的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，现有方法主要从数据角度解决校准问题，使用单一温度参数，忽略了任务间的差异，导致不同任务间的校准误差波动较大。特别是在安全关键应用中，模型不仅需要保持预测性能，还需要可靠地传达其不确定性。

Method: 提出DATS方法，结合基于原型的距离估计和距离感知校准，在没有先验任务信息的情况下推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度参数。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界的不平衡生物医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DATS方法在减少跨任务校准误差方面比现有最先进方法更稳定、可靠和一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放有效解决了持续学习中的校准问题，提高了模型在所有任务上的校准性能，特别是在任务信息不可用的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仅依赖结果奖励的方法在长期多轮智能体任务中存在稀疏监督问题，需要更有效的监督信号。

Method: Tree-GRPO方法将每个树节点表示为完整的智能体交互步骤，通过共享公共前缀增加在固定预算内的rollout数量，并利用树结构轨迹构建逐步过程监督信号。

Result: 在11个数据集和3种QA任务上的实验表明，基于树的强化学习方法优于基于链的方法。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，Tree-GRPO方法能够有效解决稀疏监督问题，提升智能体在长期多轮任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT是一种简单的潜在空间协作方法，让异构的专家LLM在全局路由方案下进行协作，通过单次推理实现优于现有多LLM方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源LLM越来越专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有的多LLM方法要么独立路由，要么通过多轮交互聚合输出，要么需要架构同质性进行权重融合，存在效率或灵活性不足的问题。

Method: MoT使用轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家，通过交互层将隐藏状态投影到共享潜在空间，主专家对活跃同行进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，仅训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT分别比当前最先进方法Avengers提升0.38%和2.92%，显著优于最佳单模型，且推理时间与路由基线相当。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LoRA微调机制如何改变模型的结构推理和语义行为是一个开放挑战，需要可解释的方法来分析微调后LLMs的内部机制。

Method: 构建生物信息学工具领域的异构知识图谱BioToolKG，设计基于反事实的微调LLMs解释器CFFTLLMExplainer，通过学习图节点和边的软掩码来生成最小结构扰动，同时优化结构稀疏性和语义差异。

Result: 应用于微调的LLaMA模型，反事实掩码揭示了模型的结构依赖性，并与LoRA诱导的参数变化相一致。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解微调后LLMs的内部机制提供了新见解，并强调反事实图作为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差（MSE），但这种方法只是f-散度的一个特例，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 构建基于f-散度的统一框架，允许使用任何f-散度来衡量目标概念和锚概念之间的分布差异，从而优化遗忘过程。

Result: 分析表明不同的f-散度会影响算法的收敛性和遗忘质量，提供了在激进遗忘和概念保留之间的权衡选择。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为特定应用选择最优散度提供了灵活范式，能够更好地平衡遗忘效果和概念保留。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

TL;DR: AirPCM是一种新颖的深度时空预测模型，通过整合多区域、多污染物动态与显式气象-污染物因果关系建模，实现准确可扩展的空气污染预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球性紧迫问题，威胁公众健康和环境可持续性。现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，难以处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性。

Method: AirPCM采用统一架构联合捕捉跨站点空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，实现细粒度、可解释的多污染物预测。

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供了可操作的见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持。

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。作者希望开发一种更平滑的优化方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出PSPO方法，在计算重要性比率前将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑技术。这种方法保留了梯度信号，同时通过向旧策略插值创建软信任区域来防止不稳定的更新。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B和Qwen2.5-1.5B模型上的实验显示，相比裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO在GSM8K任务上性能提升超过20%（0.5B模型：39.7% vs 17.6%；1.5B模型：59.4% vs 37.8%），并产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理过程。

Conclusion: PSPO提供了一种有效的替代比率裁剪的方法，在保持训练稳定性的同时显著提升模型性能，特别是在数学推理任务上表现出色，为语言模型的强化学习优化提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

Motivation: 理解过参数化线性回归中ℓp偏置插值下所有ℓr范数(r∈[1,p])的缩放行为，这一基本但未解决的问题对于理解泛化代理指标的有效性至关重要。

Method: 采用简单的对偶射线分析，识别X⊤Y中信号尖峰与零坐标之间的竞争，推导出数据依赖的转折点n⋆和通用阈值r⋆=2(p-1)。通过DLN可分离势将初始化尺度α校准为有效peff(α)，实证验证DLNs继承相同的转折点/阈值规律。

Result: 获得了ℓr范数缩放规律的闭式预测：当r<r⋆时范数饱和，当r>r⋆时以显式指数增长。DLNs实证表现出相同的缩放规律，建立了显式与隐式偏置之间的预测联系。

Conclusion: 该统一解决方案完整刻画了ℓp偏置插值下所有ℓr范数的缩放行为，揭示了不同ℓr范数作为泛化代理指标的预测能力存在敏感差异，为理解过参数化模型的行为提供了重要理论框架。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了神经网络训练数据记忆化的隐私安全问题，从理论角度证明了现有重建方法的固有局限性，并发现训练更充分的网络反而更不容易受到重建攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了隐私和安全担忧，现有重建攻击方法虽然在某些条件下有效，但缺乏坚实的理论基础，且可靠性未被充分理解

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法，从互补视角分析现有重建方法的弱点，证明在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多替代解，并通过实验验证精确复制训练数据只是偶然现象

Result: 理论证明重建方法存在根本不可靠性，实证显示训练更充分的网络（满足隐式偏差条件更强）反而更不容易受到重建攻击

Conclusion: 研究结果完善了训练数据泄露的理论理解，为缓解重建攻击提供了新见解，并在此设定下调和了隐私保护与强泛化需求之间的矛盾

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DINO（微分-积分神经算子）框架，通过分解局部微分算子和全局积分算子来改进湍流长期预测，解决了现有方法在长期自回归预测中的误差累积和物理保真度丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法（特别是神经算子）在湍流长期预测中表现不佳，无法同时捕捉湍流动力学的局部耗散效应和全局非局部相互作用这两个不同的数学结构，导致灾难性误差累积和物理保真度丢失。

Method: DINO框架通过并行分支显式建模湍流演化：局部微分算子由约束卷积网络实现，可证明收敛到导数；全局积分算子由Transformer架构学习数据驱动的全局核函数。这种基于物理的分解赋予模型卓越的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在2D Kolmogorov流基准测试中，DINO显著优于最先进模型，在数百个时间步内成功抑制误差累积，在涡度场和能谱方面保持高保真度，为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新基准。

Conclusion: DINO通过物理驱动的算子分解方法，为湍流长期演化预测提供了稳定且物理一致的解决方案，在科学计算和工程应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的兴起及其训练民主化的重要性，需要一种能够支持异构客户端自愿贡献资源的去中心化训练框架。

Method: GWTF采用新颖的去中心化流算法，寻找最有效的路由以最大化微批次训练数量并最小化延迟。

Conclusion: GWTF为大规模语言模型的去中心化训练提供了实用且高效的解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据分散在不同设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和监管限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在分布式数据上直接训练生成模型而不进行中心化聚合。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在保护隐私的同时提升流直线性和样本质量，性能接近集中式基线。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功解决了分布式数据上的隐私保护生成模型训练问题，在联邦学习设置下实现了与集中式方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Conclusion: SuperOffload证明了Superchip架构在LLM训练中的巨大潜力，通过专门优化的卸载策略可显著提升训练效率，为大规模模型训练提供了新的硬件解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对广义线性模型的新算法，能够在L^p范数约束下计算最优鲁棒追索，相比现有方法显著降低了追索成本并提高了稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法使用L^∞范数会导致追索成本过高，且缺乏理论最优性保证，需要开发在更实际的L^p范数约束下的最优追索算法。

Method: 开发了一种新的算法，在L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）约束下为广义线性模型提供可证明的最优鲁棒追索计算。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在线性和非线性模型上都显著降低了追索成本（可达几个数量级），并在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡，同时提供了更稀疏的追索方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在L^p范数约束下能够计算最优鲁棒追索，相比现有方法具有更低的成本和更好的性能，且对保证可行性的后处理方法具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.
