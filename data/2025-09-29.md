### [1] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双模型架构来检测大语言模型的幻觉现象，通过投影融合块和差分特征学习机制识别幻觉信号，发现这些信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，实现了显著的检测精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 提出双模型架构，包含投影融合块用于自适应层间特征加权，以及差分特征学习机制通过计算并行编码器之间的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上的实验显示，幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上实现了显著精度提升。分析揭示了分层'漏斗模式'，浅层特征多样性高，深层特征使用集中，仅使用1%特征维度即可保持检测性能。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，这为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可以在保持精度的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [2] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Contextual Influence Value (CI值)作为上下文质量评估新指标，通过移除每个上下文后的性能下降来量化其质量，无需复杂超参数调优，仅保留CI值为正的上下文即可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法因检索到的上下文质量差（包含不相关或噪声信息）而效果受限，传统基于预定义质量评估指标的方法未能充分利用查询、上下文列表和生成器的综合信息。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新定义为推理时数据估值问题，引入CI值指标，并开发参数化代理模型进行CI值预测，采用分层架构捕捉局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值为基础的上下文选择方法通过整合查询感知相关性、列表感知独特性和生成器感知对齐，实现了更全面的上下文质量评估，显著提升了RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

### [3] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传的最大上下文窗口，大多数模型在1000个token内就出现严重性能下降，所有模型的有效窗口都比宣传窗口小99%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM提供商宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的有效性，揭示真实世界中的上下文窗口使用情况

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试方法评估不同大小和问题类型下的上下文窗口有效性，创建了标准化比较方法

Result: 发现最大有效上下文窗口与宣传的最大上下文窗口存在显著差异，且根据问题类型而变化。大多数顶级模型在100个token内就失败，在1000个token内准确率严重下降

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口随问题类型变化，这为提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了明确可行的见解

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

### [4] [How Large Language Models Need Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21404)
*Xiaotie Deng,Hanyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI未来发展需要超越简单扩展，大语言模型需要人类构建的符号作为指南针来引导其强大的直觉能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展过于依赖规模扩展，缺乏真正的发现能力，需要引入人类符号来引导模型的直觉

Method: 提出为大型语言模型提供人类构建的符号作为指南针，以指导其强大的直觉能力

Result: 通过人类符号的引导，可以解锁AI真正的发现潜力

Conclusion: AI的未来发展需要结合人类符号的指导，而不仅仅是规模扩展

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

### [5] [One Model, Many Morals: Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Misalignments in Computational Moral Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21443)
*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统调查了语言如何调节LLMs的道德决策，发现不同语言间存在显著的道德判断不一致性，反映了文化错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于英语数据训练，但在多语言多文化环境中部署时，其道德推理能力存在泛化问题，需要评估跨语言文化背景下的道德判断一致性。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，通过精心设计的研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言间的道德判断存在显著不一致，往往反映文化错配，并识别出从分歧到推理策略等潜在驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个结构化的道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

### [6] [LLM-Based Support for Diabetes Diagnosis: Opportunities, Scenarios, and Challenges with GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21450)
*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中的表现，使用基于ADA 2025标准的合成病例进行测试，涵盖症状识别、实验室解读等多个场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难。利用大型语言模型提供结构化、可解释的决策支持，帮助临床医生和患者。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架，测试GPT-5在五个代表性场景中的表现：症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查、远程监测和多模态并发症检测。

Result: GPT-5与ADA定义的标准高度一致，表明其可作为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具。

Conclusion: GPT-5在糖尿病管理方面表现出潜力，同时强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗领域LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

### [7] [Diagnosing the Performance Trade-off in Moral Alignment: A Case Study on Gender Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21456)
*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了在减轻语言模型性别刻板印象时，公平性目标与下游任务性能之间的权衡机制，发现下游性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动，选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘，而现有的缓解遗忘方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究道德对齐过程中性能权衡的底层机制，特别是在减轻性别刻板印象时，公平性目标如何影响下游任务性能。

Method: 通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角，分析选择性遗忘刻板印象对整体遗忘水平和下游任务性能的影响。

Result: 发现下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘；现有缓解遗忘的方法对减少整体遗忘和改善下游性能效果不佳。

Conclusion: 当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要更有效的方法来平衡道德对齐与任务性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用强化学习开发能够整合组织特定知识的自定义推理模型，通过RLVR（可验证奖励的强化学习）方法在BIRD基准测试中实现了最先进的SQL生成准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够整合企业特定知识的自定义推理模型，解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的RLVR设置下。

Method: 采用简单的通用训练方法：精心设计的提示和模型选择，使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热训练，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD测试集上达到73.56%（无自一致性）和75.68%（有自一致性）的最先进准确率，且需要更少的生成次数。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简单性使其广泛适用于商业智能、数据科学和编程等企业领域。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [9] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励框架中引入混合token生成方法，通过利用模型概率分布信息而非离散采样，显著提升了推理任务的性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在推理过程中仅采样离散token，丢弃了模型概率分布的丰富信息，不必要地限制了推理搜索空间。

Method: 提出了混合token生成的统一框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间，包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入的加权和，并直接在连续混合空间中生成思维链。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码获得显著提升（10个任务中有7个提升5-35%），且仅用一半轨迹数就能达到可比精度，表明训练效率提高。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进token空间探索来提升推理性能，证明了利用分布信息在强化学习推理中的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DHRD方法通过添加分类头和推理头，在训练时使用教师推理监督，测试时仅用分类头，实现准确率提升同时保持高推理吞吐量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示在提升分类准确率的同时带来的推理吞吐量显著下降问题

Method: 双头推理蒸馏：添加池化分类头（训练和推理使用）和推理头（仅训练使用），使用标签交叉熵和token级LM损失的加权和作为损失函数

Result: 在7个SuperGLUE任务上相对池化基线提升0.65-5.47%，推理吞吐量匹配池化分类器，比CoT解码快96-142倍

Conclusion: DHRD方法有效解决了准确率与吞吐量的权衡，在保持高推理速度的同时提升分类性能

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

### [11] [On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验发现，代码的结构特性比语义特性对LLM推理能力更重要，适当的抽象（如伪代码）与代码效果相当，甚至在某些情况下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码的哪些方面（结构或语义）对提升大型语言模型的推理能力最为关键，为设计训练数据提供指导。

Method: 构建10种编程语言的平行指令数据集，应用受控扰动来选择性破坏代码的结构或语义属性，然后在5个模型家族和8个规模的LLM上进行微调评估。

Result: 在3,331个实验中，LLM对结构扰动更敏感，特别是在数学和代码任务上；伪代码和流程图等抽象表示与代码效果相当；即使包含误导信号的损坏代码，只要表面规律存在，仍能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性对LLM推理能力至关重要，适当的抽象表示可以替代代码，不同编程语言的语法风格对特定任务有不同优势。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 该系统能帮助农民更容易获取农业相关信息，提高农业产出，同时减轻呼叫中心工作负担。

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了非洲口音英语说话人日志中的领域效应，发现临床对话存在一致的领域惩罚，主要源于短轮次和频繁重叠导致的误报和漏检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非洲口音英语说话人日志中的领域效应，特别关注临床对话与一般对话的性能差异。

Method: 使用严格DER协议评估多个生产系统和开源系统，进行错误分析，并测试通过口音匹配数据微调分割模块的轻量级领域适应方法。

Result: 临床语音存在显著的领域惩罚，错误主要来自误报和漏检。轻量级适应方法减少了错误但未能消除差距。

Conclusion: 需要重叠感知的分割和平衡的临床资源作为实际改进方向，提出了跨领域基准、错误分解方法和易于复现的适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种LLM引文生成范式：生成时引文(G-Cite)和后处理引文(P-Cite)，发现在覆盖率和引文正确性之间存在权衡，推荐高风险应用优先采用检索增强的P-Cite方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、法律、学术和金融等高风险领域，可信赖的大型语言模型必须提供可验证的引文来源，因为即使小错误也可能带来严重后果。

Method: 引入两种引文生成范式：G-Cite（在解码时同时生成答案和引文）和P-Cite（先起草答案后添加或验证引文），在四个流行的归因数据集上从零样本到高级检索增强方法进行全面评估。

Result: 结果显示检索是两种范式中归因质量的主要驱动因素。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争力的正确性和中等延迟，而G-Cite方法以覆盖率和速度为代价优先考虑精确度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索中心的P-Cite优先方法，在严格声明验证等精度关键场景中保留使用G-Cite方法。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了五种VLM作为形式化器的pipeline，用于处理一次性、开放词汇和多模态的PDDL形式化，在真实、多视角、低质量图像规划任务中显著优于端到端规划生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长时程规划任务中表现不足。文本领域通过将规划问题转化为PDDL等正式规划语言取得了显著进展，但在多模态环境中，VLM作为形式化器的研究仍然稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的pipeline，能够处理一次性、开放词汇和多模态的PDDL形式化。在现有基准上评估的同时，还提出了两个新的基准，首次考虑了真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划问题。

Result: VLM作为形式化器的方法大大优于端到端规划生成方法。研究发现瓶颈在于视觉而非语言，因为VLM经常无法捕捉到必要的对象关系的完整集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）只能部分补偿性能损失。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器在多模态规划中具有显著优势，但视觉能力仍是主要瓶颈。中间文本表示方法效果不一致，表明多模态规划形式化仍有进一步研究的空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现虽然语法正确，但文化适应性不足，特别是在习语和双关语的翻译上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准过于关注语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽略了文化适宜性和本地化质量这些对实际应用至关重要的因素。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电商营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种方言变体，由母语评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型能产出语法正确的翻译，但在文化细微语言处理上仍有明显不足，需要大量人工修正。即使是高资源语言也经常误译比喻性表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 数据量不是机器翻译质量的最可靠预测指标，文化适宜性是多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，当前学术和行业基准对此关注不足。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间自适应来解决长上下文生成中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法使用静态离线学习的子空间，在数据分布变化时性能不佳，无法适应动态上下文变化。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留首尾关键token作为锚点，对中间token使用基于Oja算法的在线PCA进行低秩压缩，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持甚至提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的超长上下文基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个无需模型微调的即插即用解决方案，为内存高效的长上下文推理提供了实用框架。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿数量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠的方法来检测低质量评审。

Method: 提出了ReviewScore指标来评估评审点是否包含错误信息，开发了自动化引擎重构弱点中的显性和隐性前提，并构建了专家标注的数据集来测试LLMs自动化评估ReviewScore的能力。

Result: 验证了15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题存在错误信息，使用8个最先进的LLMs在ReviewScore上获得了中等一致性，且前提级别的事实性评估比弱点级别的事实性评估一致性显著更高。

Conclusion: 全面的分歧分析支持了完全自动化ReviewScore评估的潜力，为解决同行评审质量问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Conclusion: ToG-3通过双重演化多智能体系统，克服了传统图RAG方法的静态图构建限制，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Speculative Biased Decoding方法，用于流式应用中的同时翻译，通过使用最近输出作为草稿并偏向草稿token来减少重复生成，实现1.7倍加速和80%闪烁减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在流式应用中难以直接使用，因为需要持续更新输出同时保持低延迟和合理计算成本。

Method: 使用最近输出作为草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用方案。

Result: 在同时文本重翻译任务中实现1.7倍加速，质量不受影响，通过display-only mask-k技术减少80%闪烁。

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了有效的加速解决方案，无需额外草稿计算，显著改善用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景下的音频推理任务表现不佳，缺乏使用声学工具的能力，需要增强模型对音频信号的主动分析和处理能力。

Method: 开发了Thinking-with-Sound框架，结合语言推理和实时音频域分析，使模型能够通过多模态推理进行数值分析和数字操作，主动思考音频信号。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升了模型鲁棒性：小型模型准确率提升24.73%，大型模型提升36.61%，而现有模型在受干扰音频上准确率下降超过50%。

Conclusion: 音频思维链能够在不重新训练的情况下显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更强大的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

*Han Yuan,Yue Zhao,Li Zhang,Wuqiong Luo,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLMs生成质量的影响，发现粗粒度指标显示混合效果，但因果分析显示在大多数场景中结构化输出没有因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估方法存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制不足、依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，并在七个公开任务和一个自建推理任务上应用因果推断分析。

Result: 粗粒度指标显示结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个没有因果影响，其余5个涉及受具体指令影响的多方面因果结构。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响比先前研究显示的更为复杂，因果推断方法能提供更准确的评估，大多数场景中结构化输出实际上没有因果影响。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出了Think-as-Locals方法来改进文化感知奖励建模


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估，需要填补文化相关评估数据集的空白

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域，提出Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR激发深度文化推理

Result: 评估显示现有奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在不足，CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务正相关

Conclusion: Think-as-Locals方法能有效减轻虚假特征干扰，推进文化感知奖励建模

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

*Qianen Zhang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在同步机器翻译中扩展动作空间，引入四种自适应动作来改善实时翻译质量和延迟表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分应对同步机器翻译的严格实时约束，需要更灵活的动作来处理实时重构、省略和简化。

Method: 在仅解码器的大语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作：句子切分、丢弃、部分摘要和代词化，并通过动作感知提示构建训练参考。开发了延迟感知的TTS流水线来评估质量和延迟。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善了语义指标（如COMET-KIWI），并实现了比参考翻译和基于分片基线更低的延迟（通过平均滞后衡量）。DROP和SENTENCE_CUT组合在流畅性和延迟之间达到了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为缩小人机口译差距提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈方法解决传统多模态学习中因数据集偏差导致的OOD泛化问题，使用信息瓶颈过滤任务无关噪声，并通过因果特征解耦和工具变量约束提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于"学习注意力"的多模态学习方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化性能下降。

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；使用参数化掩码生成器将融合的多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；引入工具变量约束确保因果特征全局一致性；采用后门调整通过随机重组因果和捷径特征来稳定因果估计。

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务上进行了广泛实验，包括OOD测试集，证明了CaMIB的有效性。理论和实证分析进一步突出了其可解释性和合理性。

Conclusion: CaMIB模型通过因果原则而非传统似然方法，有效缓解了多模态学习中的数据集偏差问题，提升了模型的分布外泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Conclusion: 语言谜题生成作为一个研究任务具有重要意义，不仅能促进语言学发展，还能支持关于稀有语言的知识传播。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ResT方法，通过基于熵的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，以稳定工具使用任务的训练，在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在优化LLM工具使用策略时仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，缺乏对工具使用任务特殊性的考虑，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低。

Method: ResT通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重，实现从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑过渡。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank评估中，ResT比现有方法提升高达8.76%；在4B基础LLM上微调后，ResT在单轮任务上超过GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超过1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的token级策略梯度重塑，有效稳定了多轮工具使用任务的收敛，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统面临开放文本生成中输出可靠性判定的挑战，因为生成质量是连续谱且存在多个有效响应

Method: 使用语义一致性——集成输出在意义层面的共识，作为无需训练的可信延迟信号

Result: 语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低达60%，适用于黑盒API且对模型更新鲁棒

Conclusion: 语义一致性是级联系统中比词元级置信度更强的可靠性信号，为实际LLM部署提供了实用基准

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在专业模型的深度分析和大型语言模型的生成流畅性之间存在核心权衡，需要一种能同时兼顾两者的共情响应生成方法。

Method: 提出TRACE框架，将共情任务分解为分析和合成的结构化管道，先建立全面理解再进行生成，统一深度分析与表达性生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在自动评估和基于LLM的评估中均显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 结构化分解是创建更强大和可解释共情代理的有前景范式。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估多轮长问答（MT-LFQA）的基准KnowMT-Bench，发现在多轮对话中LLMs的事实准确性和信息效率会下降，而检索增强生成（RAG）可以有效缓解这种退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，而多轮对话基准通常评估其他能力而非知识密集型的事实准确性，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 使用动态评估设置，让模型基于逻辑递进的问题序列生成自己的多轮对话历史，然后通过人工验证的自动化流程评估最终回答的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验表明多轮上下文会降低性能：由于自生成历史带来的上下文噪声，事实能力下降；随着对话长度增加，模型变得更冗长，信息效率下降。RAG可以有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLMs在现实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了表达能力，需要开发非线性扩展来提升性能。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级非线性变换，并引入Sinter正弦激活函数添加结构化扰动而不增加参数数量。

Result: 在摘要生成和分类任务中，LoRAN持续优于QLoRA。消融研究表明Sinter优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展和Sinter激活函数有效提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使在提供正确且充分上下文的情况下仍会产生幻觉，现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法AUROC提升高达+13%。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持鲁棒性，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注响应正确性不同的提示，而忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示。本文认为这些提示并非无用，反而能为策略优化提供有意义的反馈。

Method: 提出RL-ZVP算法，直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，通过奖励正确性和惩罚错误来提供反馈，同时利用token级特征调整反馈以保留信息丰富的细微信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上最高提升8.61分，通过率最高提升7.77分，且持续优于过滤掉零方差提示的其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未被发掘的学习潜力，RL-ZVP展示了从这类提示中学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

TL;DR: QoNext框架将网络多媒体领域的QoE原则引入基础模型评估，关注用户体验而非单纯输出正确性，通过实验构建QoE数据库并训练预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法只关注输出正确性，忽略了用户体验是响应质量和交互过程共同作用的结果，无法解释用户满意度的形成机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的因素，设计控制实验收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练从系统参数预测用户感知体验的模型。

Result: QoNext不仅实现了主动和细粒度的评估，还为产品化服务提供了优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: 将QoE原则应用于基础模型评估能够更全面地捕捉用户体验，为模型优化提供更有效的指导。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，解决了MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量导致性能下降的问题，显著扩展了性能扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在训练和推理时固定激活专家数量k，但直觉上在推理时激活更多专家(k'>k)应该能提升性能。然而研究发现，增加专家数量后性能反而快速下降，这源于专家间缺乏学习到的协作。

Method: 提出EMoE训练框架，通过同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，使MoE模型能在推理时灵活扩展激活专家数量，且无需额外训练开销。

Result: 实验表明，EMoE显著扩展了有效性能扩展范围，可达到训练时k的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE框架成功解决了MoE模型推理时扩展专家数量的性能下降问题，实现了在多种计算预算下的稳健性能表现。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [44] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分。它使用两个智能体：一个提取评分标准相关组件并编码为结构化表示，另一个基于此分配最终分数，从而提高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自动评分中显示出潜力，但作为端到端评分器面临准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性有限和评分标准不对齐等挑战，阻碍了其在评估实践中的应用。

Method: 提出AutoSCORE多智能体框架，包含评分标准组件提取智能体和评分智能体。前者从学生回答中提取评分标准相关组件并编码为结构化表示，后者基于此分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上评估，使用GPT-4o、LLaMA-3.1-8B和LLaMA-3.1-70B。相比单智能体基线，AutoSCORE持续提高了评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE），在复杂多维评分标准上效果尤其显著，对小模型提升更大。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多智能体设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将同时语音翻译视为多轮对话任务，需要专门的交错训练数据和计算密集型LLM推理，效率低下

Method: SimulSense框架通过连续读取输入语音并在感知到新意义单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译

Result: 相比两个最先进的基线系统，该方法实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度比基线快9.6倍

Conclusion: SimulSense框架在同时语音翻译任务中实现了人类口译员般的读写决策，显著提升了实时效率

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

TL;DR: 链式思维提示在临床文本理解中导致86.3%的模型性能下降，与通用领域表现相反，揭示了可解释性与可靠性之间的关键悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估链式思维提示在临床电子健康记录文本理解中的有效性，因为临床领域对准确性和透明推理有严格要求，但该方法在临床环境中的效果尚未系统研究。

Method: 对95个先进大语言模型在87个真实世界临床文本任务上进行大规模系统研究，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，使用细粒度分析包括推理长度、医学概念对齐和错误分析。

Result: 与通用领域相反，86.3%的模型在链式思维设置下出现性能下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 链式思维在临床文本任务中虽然增强可解释性，但可能损害可靠性，揭示了临床环境中可解释性与可靠性之间的关键悖论，强调了透明可信方法的需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源和文化复杂环境下政治立场检测的挑战，特别是在泰语政治环境中，LLMs存在系统性偏见，如情感泄漏和实体偏好，影响了公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于推理的监督来分离情感与立场，减少偏见。发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集，包含立场、情感、推理和偏见标记。

Result: 实验结果表明，ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并提高了多个LLMs的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏见技术的重要性，为低资源语言的政治立场检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: 该框架通过动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话有效增强了LLM的创意生成能力，在创意新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性表达的简单黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLMs内部状态，但在LLMs外部API受限且外部资源有限的情况下，迫切需要建立有效的黑盒检测方法

Method: 通过调查LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现LLMs在生成事实性回答时会产生一致响应，而在非事实性回答时会产生不一致响应，基于此提出黑盒幻觉检测指标

Result: 实验表明，该指标在预测模型回答的事实性方面比使用LLMs内部知识的基线方法更有效

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法能够有效检测LLMs生成内容的事实性，且不需要访问模型内部状态或外部资源

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch是一个新的图检索增强生成方法，通过双通道检索和模块化工作流解决现有GraphRAG方法的浅层检索和结构数据利用不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：浅层检索无法发现所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据的低效利用，阻碍了复杂查询的有效推理。

Method: 提出GraphSearch，采用代理深度搜索工作流和双通道检索策略，包含六个模块的模块化框架，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试中，GraphSearch在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续优于传统策略。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

Motivation: 探索主题建模中常被视为噪声的异常值是否能够作为新兴主题的早期信号，特别是在动态新闻语料库中。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集上追踪异常值随时间的变化。

Result: 结果显示异常值倾向于随时间演化为连贯的主题，这一模式在两种模型和语言中保持一致。

Conclusion: 异常值在主题建模中不应被简单视为噪声，而是可以作为新兴主题的早期指示器。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative

news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent
topics over time across both models and languages.

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型取得了显著进展，但在处理具有歧义、多义或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战，传统概率方法无法有效捕捉冲突或不确定信号。

Method: 引入模糊推理链（FRC）框架，整合LLM语义先验和连续模糊隶属度，实现概率推理与模糊隶属推理的显式交互，逐步将模糊输入转化为清晰可解释的决策。

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理过程，促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移，理论分析和实证结果均支持其有效性。

Conclusion: FRC为处理细微和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注静态AIGT检测，而社交媒体上的内容动态受用户参与驱动且随时间演变，需要研究AIGT的时间动态和用户互动模式。

Method: 构建了来自小红书平台的5年纵向数据集RedNote-Vibe，包含用户参与度指标和时间戳；提出了基于心理语言学特征的PLAD检测框架。

Result: PLAD实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了人类和AI生成内容的区分特征，并发现了这些语言特征与社交媒体参与度之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AIGT分析提供了重要工具，有助于理解AIGT的时间动态和用户互动模式。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET质量评估分类法，旨在解决NLP评估中质量标准名称不一致导致的可比性问题，通过建立标准化的质量准则名称和定义体系来统一评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NLP评估中长期存在的质量问题：不同实验使用相同的质量标准名称（如"流畅性"）但实际评估的内容可能不同，这种名称上的可比性具有误导性，阻碍了领域基于多个独立评估得出可靠结论的科学进步。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准化的质量准则名称和定义，并将其构建为层次结构，其中父节点捕捉子节点的共同方面。

Result: 开发了QCET质量评估分类法及其相关资源，该分类法包含标准化的质量准则名称和定义体系。

Conclusion: QCET分类法有三个主要用途：(i)建立现有评估的可比性；(ii)指导新评估的设计；(iii)评估监管合规性，为解决NLP评估可比性问题提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为微调不适合模型编辑，作者认为这种失败源于采用了不合适的深度优先单样本优化流程，而非微调本身的问题。

Method: 恢复标准广度优先（基于epoch）的微调流程，采用小批次优化，并系统分析调优位置，提出LocFT-BF局部化编辑方法。

Result: LocFT-BF在多种LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有最优方法，首次实现10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的持续编辑，且不损害通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清长期误解并引入局部化调优策略，微调从被低估的基线方法发展为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，将权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵，利用校准数据集最小化功能重构误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在多个Llama和Qwen模型上均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过抽象意图表示来编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译对话语句，从而生成更具文化相关性和情境适当性的对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有模型通常基于英语对话的翻译进行训练或评估，这种方法会引入人工痕迹，降低对话的自然性和文化适当性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示，支持跨语言的灵活本地化，缓解翻译腔问题，实现更流畅自然的对话生成。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适当性方面持续优于机器翻译和人工翻译的对话。

Conclusion: DAS框架能够有效生成多语言对话，提高对话的自然性和文化适当性，优于传统的翻译方法。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法来解决生成式奖励模型中的解决-判断差距问题，通过同时利用模型的解决和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现生成式奖励模型存在显著的解决-判断差距——模型能够解决某些问题但无法做出正确判断（14%-37%），这限制了模型的判断能力。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM的输出上同时利用解决和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式连接问题解决和评估能力。

Result: S2J有效减少解决-判断差距16.2%，提升判断性能5.8%，在相同基础模型上实现SOTA性能，且使用显著更小的训练数据集。

Conclusion: S2J方法通过自进化而不依赖更强大的外部模型蒸馏，成功缩小了解决-判断差距，提升了生成式奖励模型的判断能力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展(TTS)的方法来验证复杂数值声明，通过训练验证器模型从多个推理路径中选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在验证需要组合推理和数值推理的真实世界数值声明时存在不足，无法理解数值细微差别，且容易发生推理漂移问题。

Method: 使用测试时计算扩展(TTS)从LLM中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制根据声明复杂度选择性应用TTS。

Result: TTS显著缓解了推理漂移问题，在数值声明验证任务上取得显著性能提升。自适应TTS比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，比单次验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型能有效改善复杂数值声明的验证性能，自适应机制在保持性能的同时大幅提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our
code and data can be found at https://github.com/VenkteshV/VerifierFC

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-LAP框架，通过结合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决法律条文预测任务中的挑战，在多司法管辖区数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在法律条文预测任务中存在局限性：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测场景中表现欠佳，且大多数方法缺乏跨司法管辖区的通用性。

Method: Uni-LAP框架通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM的优势：SCM使用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM采用三段论推理来优化最终预测。

Result: 在多司法管辖区数据集上的实证结果表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线方法，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架成功解决了法律条文预测中的关键挑战，为跨司法管辖区的法律文本分类提供了有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: 通过系统回顾31个模型和21个基准测试，分析编码器专用和生成式架构，考察训练方法和评估方法。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习偏向语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据。三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法，优先考虑语义一致性。存在跨语言能力差异以及训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言模型需要在语言中立性和文化意识之间取得更好平衡，当前评估方法需要更多考虑文化背景因素。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型或定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域进行优化。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到多个本体（FoodOn、SNOMED-CT、Hansard分类法），并对模型进行微调。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基线相比，性能显著优于未微调版本。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品标注语料库、发布用于推进食品领域语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought提示的冗长性导致的延迟和内存问题，以及早期错误在长链中传播的问题。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习到的潜在标记（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量或显式，通过双重目标（主要任务损失和辅助计划重构损失）确保胶囊的充分性和最小性。

Result: 在复杂基准测试中保持或提高准确性的同时，显著减少了推理的可见标记占用。

Conclusion: Reasoning Capsule框架在效率、准确性和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡，为大型语言模型的复杂推理提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

TL;DR: GTO通过引入草稿树奖励和基于组的草稿策略训练，解决了推测解码中训练与推理策略不一致的问题，显著提升了接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练目标只优化单一贪婪路径，而推理时使用树策略验证多个分支，这种策略不一致限制了推测解码的加速效果。

Method: 提出GTO方法，包含：(i) 草稿树奖励 - 无采样目标，衡量草稿树在目标模型下的期望接受长度；(ii) 基于组的草稿策略训练 - 稳定优化方案，对比当前和参考草稿模型的树，应用PPO风格的代理更新。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务上，GTO将接受长度提升7.4%，相比EAGLE-3获得额外7.7%的加速。

Conclusion: GTO通过弥合草稿策略不一致，为高效LLM推理提供了实用通用解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

Result: 平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度减少47个token，显著降低延迟，且测试时性能可通过可解释特征可靠预测。

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，支持高效模型选择和预测而无需重复微调。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

TL;DR: CompAs是一个元学习框架，通过将上下文信息转换为具有组合结构的适配器参数，实现多个信息块的代数合并，从而降低推理成本、提高长上下文稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习和监督微调方法存在效率低下和灵活性不足的问题，需要一种能够整合多个信息块的方法。

Method: 通过元学习框架将指令或演示从上下文直接映射到适配器参数，生成的适配器可以代数合并，无需重新处理长提示。

Result: 在多项选择和抽取式问答任务上，CompAs优于上下文学习和基于生成器的方法，特别是在处理更多输入时表现更好。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了一种实用且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

Motivation: 尽管推理能力的大语言模型在多种任务上取得最优表现，但推理在哪些任务和模型规模下有效、以及其训练和推理成本仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用合成数据蒸馏框架进行大规模监督研究，比较不同规模的指令微调和推理模型，在数学中心和通用任务上进行评估，包括多项选择和开放式格式。

Result: 推理持续提升模型性能，经常匹配或超越显著更大的IFT系统。IFT在训练和推理成本上保持帕累托最优，但推理模型随着模型规模扩大而价值增加，在推理密集型和开放式任务上克服IFT性能限制。

Conclusion: 推理模型在规模扩大时展现出更大价值，特别是在推理密集型任务上能突破IFT的性能限制，虽然IFT在成本效率上仍具优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTP框架使用LLM构建二进制树，通过自然语言问题对文本语料进行语义分区，生成完全可解释的分类法，比传统关键词主题模型更易理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，且通过关键词列表描述聚类需要大量人工解释，缺乏语义连贯性。

Method: 引入递归主题分区(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型交互式构建二进制树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，对数据进行语义分区。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线模型的关键词主题更易解释，且在数据主题与任务标签相关时，这些聚类可作为下游分类任务的有力特征。

Conclusion: RTP为数据探索引入了新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StableToken提出了一种稳定的语义语音分词器，通过多分支架构和位级投票机制解决现有分词器对声学扰动的脆弱性问题，显著提升了语音LLM的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义语音分词器虽然设计用于捕捉语言内容，但对与含义无关的声学扰动非常脆弱，即使在信噪比很高、语音完全可懂的情况下，输出标记序列也会发生剧烈变化，增加了下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 提出了StableToken分词器，采用多分支并行处理音频架构，通过强大的位级投票机制合并这些表示，形成单一稳定的标记序列。

Result: StableToken在标记稳定性方面达到了新的最先进水平，在各种噪声条件下显著降低了单元编辑距离（UED）。这种基础稳定性直接转化为下游效益，显著提高了SpeechLLM在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StableToken通过共识驱动机制成功解决了语义语音分词器的稳定性问题，为下游语音LLM应用提供了更可靠的标记表示。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

TL;DR: 提出复合推理(CR)方法，让大语言模型能够动态组合多种推理风格（演绎、归纳、溯因等），在科学和医学问答任务中超越现有方法，展现更好的样本效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖单一推理范式，限制了在复杂问题上使用多样化认知策略的能力，需要更灵活的多推理风格组合方法。

Method: 引入复合推理(CR)方法，使LLMs能够动态探索和组合多种推理风格，根据问题领域自适应地强调适当的推理方式。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法超越了Chain-of-Thought和DeepSeek-R1等基线方法，表现出更高的准确率、更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，大语言模型获得了更鲁棒、自适应和高效的问题解决能力，复合推理方法显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出逆向投机解码（RSD）方法，通过让教师模型生成候选词元，学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，从而生成学生友好的推理轨迹，解决大模型向小模型知识迁移时的分布对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大模型向小模型的知识迁移方法往往失败，因为大模型的推理轨迹包含小模型分布中低概率的词元，超出了小模型的内部表示能力，反而造成学习障碍。

Method: 提出逆向投机解码（RSD）：教师模型生成候选词元，学生模型基于自身概率分布决定接受或拒绝，过滤低概率词元，生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上的实验表明，直接蒸馏s1K-1.1推理轨迹数据使平均性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练使性能提升4.9%。

Conclusion: 低概率词元是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈，RSD方法有效但生成的轨迹是模型特定的，分布对齐需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

TL;DR: 提出了FeatBench基准测试，专门评估LLM在"氛围编程"范式下的功能实现能力，填补了现有代码生成基准测试的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试与"氛围编程"范式不匹配，要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，特点包括：纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例（F2P和P2P测试）、多样化的应用领域。

Result: 评估结果显示，在氛围编程范式下实现功能具有显著挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%。分析还发现了"激进实现"策略的倾向。

Conclusion: FeatBench为社区研究提供了新的评估工具，揭示了氛围编程中功能实现的挑战性和"激进实现"策略的双重影响。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是人机自然交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的基准测试和建模方法，特别是在紧急中断场景下的评估。

Method: 开发FLEXI基准测试，包含6个多样化的人机交互场景，系统评估延迟、质量和对话效果，特别关注模型在紧急情况下的中断能力。

Result: 发现开源模型与商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测是实现真正无缝和类人全双工交互的有前景路径。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

TL;DR: 该论文从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题，提出了安全合规性框架，基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建新基准，并通过GRPO方法训练Compliance Reasoner模型，在安全合规性方面取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法缺乏系统性保护，无法应对现代LLM系统的复杂行为。作者认为法律框架可以作为定义和衡量安全合规性的标准。

Method: 1. 基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR开发新的安全合规性基准；2. 使用GRPO方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升+10.45%，GDPR平均提升+11.85%。

Conclusion: 从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题是有效的，Compliance Reasoner能够显著提升LLM的安全合规性表现。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到大型语言模型的推理过程中，通过知识图谱检索、编码和适配模块解决现有方法只利用语义信息而忽略结构信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型处理幻觉问题的主要方法是结合知识图谱，但通常将知识图谱视为纯文本，仅提取语义信息而忽略了关键的结构方面。另一个挑战是知识图谱编码器和LLM文本嵌入空间之间的差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: 提出SSKG-LLM模型架构，包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块和知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来在利用结构的同时保留语义，然后加入知识图谱适配(KGA)模块使LLM能够理解知识图谱嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合知识图谱结构信息如何增强LLM的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息到LLM的推理过程中，增强模型的事实推理能力，解决了现有方法忽略结构信息的问题。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型常复制训练数据中的社会偏见，且黑盒特性使用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP可解释性的研究多为定性分析，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中系统研究可解释性与公平性的关系，关注编码器和仅解码器模型，考察三个维度：识别偏见预测、选择公平模型、训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并作为有用监督减少训练中的偏见，但在选择公平模型候选者方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 输入解释在检测和缓解偏见方面有效，但不适合用于模型选择，为公平NLP提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型；谓词可用性提升性能15-20%；T5模型优于更大的仅解码器LLM；模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译证明是稳健的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系推理的能力，以及模型规模对这种能力的影响。传递关系推理在因果推断等场景中至关重要。

Method: 生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在不同图大小下推断传递关系的能力，特别关注网格图的维度对学习难度的影响。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维网格状有向图的连通性推断，高维网格图更具挑战性。增大模型规模能改善在网格图上的泛化能力，但对于包含多个不连通分量的非网格图，模型学习困难。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习传递关系推理，但性能受图结构特性（如维度、连通性）和模型规模的影响。低维网格图相对容易学习，而复杂非网格图更具挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes

### [86] [Exploratory Semantic Reliability Analysis of Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22366)
*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个使用大语言模型对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析的框架，超越传统文本分类，实现故障模式识别、因果链推理等复杂分析任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中的非结构化文本包含丰富的运维智能，但传统定量可靠性分析方法难以利用这些信息。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在文本分类层面，无法进行复杂推理。

Method: 引入探索性框架，利用大语言模型执行四种分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推理、对比站点分析和数据质量审计。

Result: 大语言模型可以作为强大的"可靠性协作者"，超越标签分类，综合文本信息并生成可操作的专家级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用大语言模型作为推理工具提供了新颖且可复现的方法论，为风能行业解锁非结构化数据中隐藏的洞察提供了新途径。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

### [87] [What Is The Political Content in LLMs' Pre- and Post-Training Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22367)
*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析OLMO2开源模型的训练数据发现，左倾政治内容在数据集中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的政治偏见密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已知会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见来源尚不清楚。分析训练数据中的政治内容是理解这一问题的关键步骤。

Method: 从OLMO2的完整预训练和后训练语料库中抽取大样本，自动标注文档的政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，并评估训练数据中政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料包含比后训练数据显著更多的政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源来构建相似主题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据管理流程中整合政治内容分析，并深入记录过滤策略以提高透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Chimera测试套件，包含7,500个高质量图表，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现当前模型主要依赖三种捷径而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图谱相关基准测试中表现良好，但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径，而非真正理解和推理图表。

Method: 创建Chimera测试套件，包含7,500个维基百科图表，每个图表用语义三元组标注符号内容，并设计多层次问题评估四个基本理解方面。

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其看似强大的性能主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响轻微，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在关键局限性，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准化对复杂视觉输入的真实理解，而非问题回答捷径。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

### [89] [Detecting (Un)answerability in Large Language Models with Linear Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22449)
*Maor Juliet Lavi,Tova Milo,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答性的方法，在抽取式问答任务中有效识别无答案问题，并具有良好的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常在缺乏足够信息时仍自信地回答，导致产生幻觉答案。需要解决(un)answerability检测问题，特别是在抽取式问答中判断段落是否包含足够信息来回答问题。

Method: 通过激活加法在推理过程中识别模型激活空间中捕捉不可回答性的方向，并将隐藏激活投影到该方向来获得可靠的(un)answerability分类分数。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测不可回答问题，在跨数据集泛化方面优于现有的基于提示和基于分类器的方法。

Conclusion: 获得的激活方向不仅适用于抽取式QA，还能扩展到由缺乏科学共识和主观性等因素导致的不可回答性。因果干预表明添加或消融这些方向能有效控制模型的弃权行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM构成显著挑战，准确率常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗性脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和局限性至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境中的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，在多语言法律和非法律基准上测试LLaMA和Gemini，并通过字符和词级扰动评估其对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 法律推理基准LEXam上的准确率常低于50%，而通用任务XNLI上超过70%；Gemini平均比LLaMA高约24个百分点；性能与语言和英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键的多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观察方法无法揭示语义变化的因果机制，而人类实验难以应用于历时过程。需要新方法来模拟语义变化过程。

Method: 使用神经代理框架，首先将代理基于真实词汇系统，然后系统性地操纵其交际需求，通过监督学习和强化学习管道进行实验。

Result: 训练'说'现有语言的神经代理能够在颜色命名中显著重现人类模式，支持进一步使用该框架阐明语义变化机制。

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex框架成功模拟了语义变化，为理解词汇语义变化的机制提供了有效的计算建模方法。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过监督微调或强化学习来提升LLM的问题解决能力，本文从新的视角研究单个问题下LLM生成解决方案的差异性。

Method: 提出解决方案分歧作为新指标，在三个代表性问题领域测试该指标对监督微调和强化学习策略的支持效果。

Result: 实验表明使用解决方案分歧能持续提高成功率，在不同模型中都观察到解决方案分歧与问题解决能力之间的正相关关系。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高度可解释的LLM表示，具有卓越的可扩展性和实时适应性，能够动态适应不断扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出AMBS框架解决LLM多目标对齐中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题，通过两阶段1-to-N架构实现统一高效的多目标对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化单个对齐目标时会覆盖其他目标的表示，导致灾难性遗忘；而简单的多分支设计虽然缓解了遗忘问题，但会造成跨目标输出不一致的推理碎片化。

Method: 两阶段1-to-N框架：阶段I计算共享的后注意力隐藏状态表示；阶段II通过策略参考机制克隆到并行分支进行目标特定控制，同时保持跨目标一致性。

Result: 在Alpaca、BeaverTails和TruthfulQA上的实验表明，AMBS在多个7B LLM骨干上持续改进HHH对齐。在DeepSeek-7B上，相比朴素1-to-N基线，平均对齐分数提升+32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%。

Conclusion: AMBS框架有效解决了多目标对齐中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题，在保持与最先进方法竞争力的同时，显著提升了多目标对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本阻碍了创新，FP8训练虽有理论效率优势但缺乏开源训练方案，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值精度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方案稳定且基本无损，在推理基准测试中与BF16基线相当，同时训练时间减少22%，峰值内存使用降低14%，吞吐量提升19%。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以进一步普及大规模模型训练。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs的逻辑推理范式不适合处理社会情境，因为社会情境涉及对模糊线索的解释性分析，很少产生明确结果。需要模拟人类社会认知过程来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出CogFlow框架：1) 通过树状规划模拟人类思维的联想性和渐进性，构建认知流数据集；2) 通过监督微调注入基本认知推理能力；3) 采用强化学习，通过多目标奖励优化认知流和响应质量，让模型通过试错自我改进。

Result: 广泛实验表明，CogFlow有效增强了LLMs的社会认知能力，甚至对人类也有帮助，导致更有效的社会决策制定。

Conclusion: 认知推理范式和社会认知建模能够显著提升LLMs在社会情境中的表现，CogFlow框架为增强人工智能的社会智能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR门户中的异步患者-临床医生消息增加了临床医生工作量，LLM可用于辅助起草回复，但LLM输出可能存在临床不准确、遗漏或语气不匹配等问题，需要稳健的评估方法。

Method: 开发了包含5个领域59个错误代码的临床错误本体；构建检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用语义相似的历史消息-响应对；采用两阶段DSPy提示架构进行可扩展、可解释的分层错误检测。

Result: 在1,500多条患者消息上测试，检索上下文改善了临床完整性和工作流程适当性等领域的错误识别。人工验证显示上下文增强标签的协议一致性(50% vs 33%)和性能(F1=0.500 vs 0.256)均优于基线。

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI护栏，检索上下文显著提高了LLM生成回复的质量评估准确性。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient

TL;DR: 研究使用LLMs定位上下文幻觉的可行性，构建了专门的基准测试，并提出了基于自由文本描述的新表示方法。研究发现LLMs在该任务上表现有限，主要挑战包括错误标记缺失细节和难以处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本未验证的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉定位评估流程复杂，研究探索使用LLMs作为更实用的替代方案。由于缺乏专门的元评估基准，需要构建适合LLMs的测试集。

Method: 构建包含1000多个示例的人工标注基准测试，提出基于自由文本描述的幻觉表示方法，评估了四个大规模LLMs，分析最佳提示策略。

Result: 基准测试难度较高，最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.67。LLMs倾向于错误标记缺失细节为不一致，且难以处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本未验证的输出。

Conclusion: LLMs在幻觉定位任务上仍有挑战，需要改进提示策略和处理与参数知识冲突的情况。自由文本描述表示方法能更好地捕捉各种错误类型。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自然语言结构建模提供一个严格且可解释的基础，验证次正则层次结构在语言学习中的适用性。

Method: 使用判定谓词表示次正则语言类，通过合成实验和真实数据实验（英语形态学）验证线性可分性。

Result: 在无噪声条件下实现完美可分性，英语形态学实验中学习到的特征与已知语言约束一致。

Conclusion: 次正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严谨且可解释的基础，证明了其在语言学习中的有效性。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Conclusion: 研究结果在公共政策制定、辩论评估、决策支持框架和大规模社交媒体意见挖掘方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media
opinion mining.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一套基于重采样的方法，用于量化多语言和/或多任务NLP基准测试中评估指标的不确定性和统计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验性能分数的变化既来自模型相关因素也来自数据相关因素，需要同时考虑这两者以避免显著低估整体变异性。

Method: 使用重采样方法来量化评估指标的不确定性，考虑模型和数据相关的变异性来源。

Result: 通过多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等任务演示，重采样方法可用于计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布。

Conclusion: 重采样方法能够有效量化NLP基准测试中的不确定性，为模型比较和排名提供更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

### [104] [StateX: Enhancing RNN Recall via Post-training State Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22630)
*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种通过后训练高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的训练流程，能够提升循环神经网络的长上下文记忆能力和上下文学习能力，而不会显著增加参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文时成本高昂，而RNN虽然具有恒定复杂度，但受限于固定大小的循环状态，难以准确回忆长上下文信息。直接训练更大状态的RNN成本过高。

Method: 针对线性注意力和状态空间模型两类RNN，设计了后训练架构修改，在不增加或仅轻微增加参数的情况下扩展状态大小。

Result: 在1.3B参数模型上的实验表明，StateX能有效提升RNN的回忆能力和上下文学习能力，且后训练成本低，不影响其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文处理中的局限性，同时保持了低复杂度优势。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将思维轨迹作为隐变量的变分推理框架，通过变分推断优化语言模型的推理能力，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型提供原则性的概率视角，统一变分推理与强化学习方法，改进模型的推理能力。

Method: 从证据下界出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式稳定变分后验训练，将拒绝采样微调和二元奖励强化学习解释为局部前向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上广泛验证，在多种推理任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该工作为改进语言模型推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数，揭示了之前未被注意到的对简单问题的偏好偏差。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略(FCP)，将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练学习反馈条件后验分布，并引入在线自举阶段来优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题。

Method: FCP直接从响应-反馈对中学习，通过最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验分布，并加入在线自举阶段在正向条件下生成并接收新反馈来优化策略。

Result: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLMs提供了更丰富的从语言反馈中学习的方式。

Conclusion: FCP方法能够更有效地利用语言反馈的丰富信息，避免了标量奖励的信息压缩问题。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

### [107] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: N-gram新颖性作为评估语言模型创造性的指标存在不足，研究发现91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被专家评为有创意，且开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性伴随低实用性。前沿闭源模型产生创意表达的可能性低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究n-gram新颖性作为创造力衡量指标的局限性，因为创造力需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性（实用性和合理性）。

Method: 通过7542个专家标注（26位专家）对人工和AI生成文本进行细读评估，分析n-gram新颖性与专家判断创造力的关系，并测试不同LLM识别创意表达的能力。

Result: n-gram新颖性与专家判断创造力正相关，但91%高n-gram新颖性表达不被评为创意；开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性伴随低实用性；前沿闭源模型产生创意表达的能力低于人类；LLM识别创意表达表现优于随机但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 不应单独依赖n-gram新颖性评估创造力，LLM在识别创意表达方面表现尚可但在识别非实用表达方面存在困难，最佳模型的LLM-as-a-Judge新颖性评分能预测专家偏好。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent是一个创新的网站生成代理系统，通过多级视觉反馈和GUI代理测试来迭代生成和优化网站代码库，显著提升了代码生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码代理在网站代码生成任务中仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是在视觉效果和用户交互方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，利用视觉语言模型(VLM)生成详细的文本描述和建议，结合截图和GUI代理测试评分，采用回溯和选择最佳机制，并引入Step-GRPO训练方法使用截图和GUI代理分数作为奖励信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升到51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升到3.9；Step-GRPO训练将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升到45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升到3.7。

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent通过综合视觉反馈机制显著提升了网站代码生成的质量和准确性，证明了视觉反馈在代码生成任务中的重要性，为LLM代理系统提供了有效的改进方向。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

TL;DR: 提出了VoiceAssistant-Eval基准测试，用于全面评估语音AI助手在听、说、看三个维度的能力，包含10,497个测试用例，覆盖13个任务类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估语音AI助手在听、说、看三个维度的综合能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含10,497个测试用例的基准测试，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及多样化图像的视觉任务。评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio。

Result: 发现专有模型并非全面优于开源模型；大多数模型在说话任务表现良好但在音频理解方面落后；设计良好的小模型可以与更大模型竞争。Step-Audio-2-mini(7B)在听力准确率上是LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual的两倍多。

Conclusion: 多模态输入和角色扮演语音模仿仍是当前模型的挑战，在鲁棒性和安全对齐方面仍有显著差距。VoiceAssistant-Eval为下一代AI助手的开发提供了严格的评估框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at
https://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .

### [110] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出系统框架评估白盒监控器检测真实模型行为而非表面诱导伪影的能力，针对欺骗检测提出三种缓解策略：内容过滤、分数过滤和提示蒸馏微调模型，发现诱导泄漏和推理泄漏会夸大监控器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和评估白盒监控器需要包含目标行为的响应样本，但用于诱导行为的信息会泄漏到监控器数据中，夸大其有效性，需要区分真实模型行为和表面诱导伪影。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）、提示蒸馏微调模型（训练模型无需显式提示即可展现欺骗行为）。

Result: 发现两种泄漏形式会夸大监控器性能：诱导泄漏（来自明确请求有害行为的提示）和推理泄漏（来自模型口头化欺骗行为）。内容过滤可降低AUROC 30%，分数过滤降低15%，微调模型降低性能达40%。

Conclusion: 白盒监控器评估需要控制诱导信号泄漏，内容过滤是有效的缓解策略，但微调模型会显著降低监控器性能，即使重新训练也难以恢复。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

TL;DR: 提出决策支点概念，通过自训练管道验证和压缩思维链推理，无需真实推理数据或外部指标即可对齐推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链推理暴露了大型语言模型的中间思考过程，但大规模验证这些推理轨迹仍然是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 引入决策支点作为最小可验证检查点，提出自训练管道：(i)采样多样化推理路径并挖掘共享决策支点，(ii)使用辅助验证器将每个轨迹压缩为支点聚焦的短路径推理，(iii)使用自生成输出进行后训练。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下有效对齐推理过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant

*Mohammad Parsa Afshar,Aryan Azimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究使用EEG数据和机器学习模型预测消费者行为，比较了传统机器学习模型和图神经网络(GNN)的性能，发现GNN在某些基础标准上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，EEG数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集中提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建大脑连接特征，使用传统机器学习模型和不同架构的GNN模型进行比较。

Result: 虽然整体结果没有显著差异，但GNN模型在某些基础标准上表现更好，而传统模型在这些方面表现不理想。

Conclusion: EEG信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，研究提供了传统模型与GNN在基于EEG的神经营销中的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

*Peng Luo,Xiayin Lou,Yu Zheng,Zhuo Zheng,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识，自动设计和改进地理空间算法。它在两个嵌套循环中运行：内循环生成候选解决方案，外循环评估全局精英并查询地理知识库，引导搜索走向理论上有意义且计算高效的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的算法发现框架（如AlphaEvolve）擅长演化通用代码，但缺乏解决复杂地理空间问题所需的领域知识和多步推理能力。地理空间建模对可持续性和气候变化等全球挑战提供关键解决方案。

Method: GeoEvolve采用多智能体LLM框架，将进化搜索与地理空间领域知识相结合。框架包含内循环（代码演化器生成和变异候选解决方案）和外循环（智能体控制器评估全局精英并查询GeoKnowRAG模块，这是一个注入地理学理论先验的结构化地理空间知识库）。

Result: 在空间插值（克里金法）和空间不确定性量化（地理空间符合预测）两个基准任务上，GeoEvolve自动改进和发现了新算法，将空间插值误差（RMSE）降低了13-21%，并将不确定性估计性能提高了17%。消融研究证实领域引导检索对于稳定、高质量的演化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展的路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，通过整合临床变量和CT影像来自动化生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求增加，准确且可解释的生存分析在肿瘤学中仍然是一个核心挑战。

Method: 使用深度学习推断与生存相关的特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式。风险估计采用透明的Cox回归，能够将患者分层为具有不同生存结果的组别。

Result: 在头颈癌开源数据集RADCURE上，MultiFIX实现了C-index为0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法，并与已知预后标志物一致。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，MultiFIX框架为此提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出语义F1分数，这是一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标将语义相关的预测视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。需要一种能够给予语义相关但不完全相同标签部分信用的评估方法。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，通过新颖的两步精度-召回公式，能够比较任意大小的标签集，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似的标签。

Result: 通过理论论证和在合成及真实数据上的广泛实证验证，语义F1分数展现出更好的可解释性和生态效度。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数提供了更公平的评估，仅需要领域适当的相似度矩阵而非严格的本体论，适用于各种任务和模态。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Conclusion: 该研究为具身AI系统的物理安全评估提供了有效方法，通过可解释的安全推理提高了模型在现实世界交互中的安全可靠性。

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，利用ASR模型辅助低资源语言的TTS系统开发，仅需少量配对数据和未配对文本即可生成高质量语音


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言因配对文本-语音数据稀缺而难以开发高质量TTS系统的问题，利用更易获取的ASR模型资源

Method: 1) 使用IPA标记训练多语言TTS基线；2) 在目标语言少量配对数据上微调；3) 应用GRPO优化，使用预训练ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估模型的多目标奖励

Result: 在低资源语言中生成可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调方法；在高资源语言中也超越DPO等离线对齐方法

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效利用ASR资源提升TTS性能，适用于各种资源水平的语言，提供了一种数据高效的TTS开发方案

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

TL;DR: RoT通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤作为可组合的"思维"步骤来指导新问题，显著减少推理延迟和成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这会增加延迟和成本，因此需要推理时的高效性。

Method: RoT将推理步骤组织成具有顺序和语义边的思维图，通过检索查询相关节点并应用奖励引导的遍历来组装问题特定的模板，指导生成过程。

Result: RoT在多个模型上的推理基准测试显示，输出标记减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索动态构建模板，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于神经VRP求解器的终身学习框架LLR-BC，通过行为整合有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，在多个任务序列中保持性能并提升零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器通常基于预定义任务进行一次性训练，面对新任务时要么依赖零样本泛化（性能可能较差），要么通过微调导致灾难性遗忘。需要一种能够持续学习多个任务而不遗忘先前知识的终身学习范式。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过行为整合方法将新任务训练的求解器行为与缓冲的先前任务行为进行对齐，并以决策寻求方式为低置信度决策分配更大的整合权重，从而更关注关键经验。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的大量实验表明，LLR-BC在终身学习设置下能够训练高性能神经求解器，有效解决灾难性遗忘问题，保持模型可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在多个任务序列中持续学习而不遗忘先前知识，同时提升模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准，用于评估自主代理在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现现有LLM代理在这些任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、商业投资、科学发现）往往需要长视野和部分可观测环境下的持续能力。

Method: 通过探索任务在三个不同环境中验证核心能力，设计长视野发现任务，要求代理通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用；标准配置下也超过35k token和60+工具调用。LLM代理在这些设置中表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 现有代理在长视野能力上存在明显差距，简单扩展方法在任务中失败，主要失败原因包括上下文锁定和功能性基础能力差距。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对构建端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的充分评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含8个任务的基准，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLM发现显著差距：模型在真实布局的组合和跨元素推理上仍有困难，面对UI和内容扰动时鲁棒性有限，在识别和避免安全关键操作方面过于保守。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了当前MLLM在网页理解能力上的重要局限性，为未来模型开发提供了有价值的评估基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的GUI代理框架，通过应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐和后执行状态反思来提升MLLM在GUI任务中的性能，无需复杂轨迹数据训练即可实现强泛化能力。

Motivation: 解决当前GUI代理面临的三个关键挑战：端到端训练的数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测的高成本以及矛盾指导的风险。

Method: 采用三阶段认知循环框架：1）思考阶段使用应用特定提示检索机制；2）对齐阶段包含思维-行动一致性检查和行动修正代理；3）反思阶段通过状态反思代理从经验中学习。

Conclusion: D-Artemis框架成功提升了通用MLLM在GUI任务中的能力，无需复杂轨迹数据集训练，展示了强大的泛化性能，为GUI代理开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为缺乏真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于轨迹的LLM评估方法准确性有限

Method: 使用通用推理器调度针对性状态探测任务，领域特定评估器主动与环境交互收集额外观察，从而分配更准确可验证的奖励

Result: 在3000多个轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提升5.3%和19.4%，与最先进策略智能体集成可将成功率提升22.4%

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互显著改进了GUI智能体的奖励评估准确性，为训练和评估提供了更可靠的奖励信号

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究决策公理（如伦理约束）在决策建模中的作用，探索公理在决策制定和评估中的潜在冲突。

Method: 引入一个基于公理的决策建模框架，根据结构特性定义决策公理分类法，分析决策-评估悖论。

Result: 发现决策-评估悖论在现实公理结构中普遍存在，揭示了决策制定和评估之间的内在张力。

Conclusion: 在基于决策数据训练模型或应用公理进行决策和评估时，必须格外谨慎以避免悖论带来的问题。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Conclusion: DeepTravel框架成功构建了自主旅行规划代理，通过强化学习和分层奖励建模，提升了代理在多步推理中的探索、验证和优化能力，实现了小型LLM在旅行规划任务中的卓越表现。

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型驱动的多智能体系统中涌现行为研究缺乏受控实验原则性方法的问题，超越脆弱、临时的智能体设计。

Method: 引入Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特质）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个模块，由LLM推理引擎协调。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个新的图表示学习范式，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标，解决了传统MPNN和Transformer在计算图建模中的架构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNN)和Transformer在计算图建模中存在架构不匹配，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性。

Method: 1. 使用层次化Transformer模拟逐步计算流程；2. 引入函数偏移学习目标，预测真实全局函数与简单局部近似之间的差异。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标为图计算学习提供了更鲁棒的范式。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

TL;DR: 提出DyRo-MCTS方法，将动作鲁棒性估计集成到MCTS中，用于动态作业车间调度问题，在保证性能的同时提高对未知作业到达的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线学习策略在动态作业车间调度中不完善，而传统MCTS在面对新作业到达的不确定性时决策脆弱，需要提高在线规划的鲁棒性。

Method: DyRo-MCTS方法，在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境走向既产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升离线学习策略性能，在线规划时间增加可忽略，且在各种调度场景中始终优于传统MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下获得长期可持续的性能提升，有效解决了动态作业车间调度中的不确定性挑战。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现ML方法在准确性上优于SPM，而两种方法在可解释性方面都获得了专家认可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，强调了可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策的重要性。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理能力，导致计划不一致和通信冗余，降低协作效率。需要显式的意图感知信念建模来实现高效协作。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，为LLM智能体构建协作信念世界，包含物理环境和协作伙伴心智状态的联合建模。使用符号化信念语言解析开放世界任务知识，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，CoBel-World相比最强基线显著减少通信成本22-60%，提高任务完成效率4-28%。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电商风险管理中需要多步骤、有状态交互的复杂任务，这些代理通常局限于单步任务，缺乏处理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492单步和2,386多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802单步和320多步轨迹）、RISK-R1强化微调框架（考虑输出格式、单步精度、多步权重和任务难度四个方面的奖励机制）。

Conclusion: RISK提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，用于自动化复杂的网络交互，推动了电商风险管理领域的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

TL;DR: 该论文证明反转诅咒不是语言模型的固有局限，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图谱上训练模型，可以诱导出双线性关系结构，从而缓解反转诅咒并实现一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反转诅咒的根本原因，探索语言模型能否通过改进知识表示来克服这一限制，并实现逻辑一致的模型编辑。

Method: 从零开始在合成关系知识图谱数据集上训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 发现双线性关系结构显著缓解了反转诅咒，使模型能够推断未见过的反向事实。这种结构在模型编辑中起关键作用，能正确传播编辑到相关事实。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。双线性内部表示使语言模型在编辑后能保持逻辑一致性。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等能力混在一起，难以分离评估纯粹的代理推理能力。需要专门的基准测试来理解LLM在需要主动使用工具收集信息时的推理能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准测试，要求LLM代理解决小学数学问题但只提供问题而不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息。提出代理推理图概念，将环境文档嵌入聚类为节点，将工具调用映射到最近节点来构建推理路径。

Result: 即使是GPT-5这样的前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准测试中也仅达到67%的准确率。分析发现许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问已访问节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: GSM-Agent基准测试和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究。提出的工具增强测试时扩展方法可以改进LLM的代理推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面分析了这一可调空间，为创建具有特定推理配置的LLM以满足多样化应用需求提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持多目标搜索的广义问题表述，通过聚合函数优化隐藏目标，使标准MOS算法能够应用于复杂的机器人规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人系统需要同时平衡多个冲突目标，但现有问题表述无法直接应用最先进的多目标搜索算法。

Method: 使用聚合函数将隐藏搜索目标转化为可优化目标，扩展标准MOS算法的核心操作以适配特定聚合函数。

Result: 在多个机器人规划问题中，扩展后的算法比原始版本性能提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的广义问题表述使标准MOS算法能够有效处理复杂的多目标机器人规划问题。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，现有能耗估算工具虽然易于使用，但其假设和简化可能影响估算准确性，需要系统验证这些工具的可靠性。

Method: 提出了验证框架，通过数百个AI实验，将静态和动态能耗估算方法与真实测量数据进行系统性比较分析。

Result: 研究发现现有估算方法虽然能大致反映AI能耗模式，但存在高达40%的持续误差，揭示了估算工具在准确性方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 本研究为AI能耗估算提供了透明度验证，制定了改进指南，并为资源感知的机器学习和AI可持续性研究做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

*Seoyoung Lee,Seonbin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Hyesoo Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM代理在泛化性、延迟和长序列任务中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划器-执行器代理存在泛化性差、延迟高和长序列任务一致性有限的问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 采用结构化两级规划框架：高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，确保一致性和泛化性；通过用户行为日志的任务挖掘识别用户特定模式；低层规划根据实时GUI上下文将高层计划转化为具体动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间均有显著提升，在长序列任务中保持超过60.0%的成功率，证明了其在复杂多步骤工作流中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合结构化规划和任务挖掘方法，实现了鲁棒且适应性强的GUI自动化，特别在复杂长序列任务中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应明确考虑标注不确定性，使用直接处理概率分布的度量方法，而非简单的多数投票等传统聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性，标注者之间存在分歧且置信度不均，传统聚合方法掩盖了这种变异性。在医学影像基准测试中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Method: 提出使用概率度量方法，这些方法直接操作于分布，可应用于任何标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型），计算轻量且具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑标注置信度显著改变了模型排名结果。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估方法，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据的实际情况。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Method: 系统化方法结合LLM和进化算法，迭代生成和优化启发式解，并与传统方法（有限首次适应和混合首次适应）进行比较。

Result: LLM生成的启发式解比传统方法更高效且计算资源需求更少，GPT-4o在两轮迭代内达到最优解，平均箱数从16减少到15，空间利用率从0.76-0.78提升到0.83。

Conclusion: LLM在组合优化任务中表现出色，能够产生更优解，为LLM在专业领域的评估提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用多模态大模型缺乏医疗专业知识，容易产生错误回答，且知识蒸馏难以捕捉放射学和药理学等专业领域知识，大规模医疗数据预训练计算成本高。

Method: 结合通用和医疗多模态数据，提出五维质量评估框架筛选高质量数据集，采用低到高图像分辨率和多模态序列打包提高训练效率，使用三阶段监督微调进行复杂医疗任务知识提取。

Result: 在MedEvalKit评估中，1.7B版本优于Qwen2.5VL-3B，4B版本超越HuatuoGPT-V-7B和MedGemma-27B-IT，在医疗视觉问答和诊断任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗AI提供了更可靠有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时实现最优有限状态自动机表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态空间模型的转移矩阵在计算效率和表达能力之间存在权衡：对角矩阵计算高效但表达能力受限，非结构化矩阵表达能力强但计算成本过高

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复数对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系

Result: 理论上能模拟任意N状态FSA，实验在FSA状态跟踪任务中优于多种现代SSM变体，在时间序列分类中性能与神经控制微分方程相当

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持对角SSM计算效率的同时实现了最优FSA表达能力，为状态空间模型提供了新的结构化参数化方法

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更简单的基于LLM预期解释的反事实生成方法，将其表示为非确定性因果模型，适用于任何黑盒LLM且无需修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，既不是字面解释（涉及改变采样过程实现），也不是预期解释（将非确定性LLM表示为确定性因果模型）。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，基于LLM的预期语义生成反事实，该方法对任何黑盒LLM直接适用且不依赖实现细节。

Result: 新方法比现有方法更简单，能直接应用于任何黑盒LLM，而现有方法直接实现特定类型的反事实生成，适用于某些目的但不适用于其他。

Conclusion: 为基于LLM预期语义的反事实推理提供了理论基础，为开发面向特定应用的新型反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Motivation: 受《思考，快与慢》中人类双过程认知理论的启发，旨在让LLM更接近人类的认知过程，在保持效率的同时提高复杂推理任务的准确性。

Method: 使用多智能体架构：首先由快速思维智能体（系统1）生成快速答案，如果检测到不确定性，则触发包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体的系统2推理流程。

Result: 实验结果显示，PRIME让开源LLaMA 3模型在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，能够与GPT-4、GPT-4o等最先进的闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为改进LLM在需要复杂、知识密集型推理的领域提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer进行文本控制的视觉编辑，生成多视角一致的机器人操作视频；采用AdaMix策略动态调整训练权重，专注于感知或运动学上的困难样本。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和混合训练策略，有效解决了机器人操作数据稀缺问题，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Method: 引入ASAL++方法，使用第二个基础模型根据模拟的视觉历史提出新的进化目标。探索两种策略：EST（每次迭代匹配单个新提示）和ETT（匹配整个生成提示序列）。在Lenia基底中使用Gemma-3进行实证测试。

Result: EST策略促进更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT策略培养更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指明了具有开放特性的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，将几何推理重新定义为交互式的感知-推理-动作循环，通过动态操作几何图形来解决问题，显著优于静态感知方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型将几何图形视为静态图像处理，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理需要辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: GeoSketch集成三个模块：感知模块将图形抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图动作模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练：监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试中，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一层次决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，GeoSketch将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论中赋能概念的无监督评估框架EELMA，用于评估语言模型代理在开放环境中的能力，无需人工设计具体任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于基准测试的评估方法成本高且需要人工设计任务，难以适应语言模型代理在真实世界工具中的广泛应用需求。

Method: 引入EELMA算法，通过计算代理行为与未来状态之间的互信息来近似估计赋能，并在语言游戏和网页浏览场景中验证。

Result: 赋能与平均任务性能强相关，能表征环境复杂性、思维链、模型规模和记忆长度等因素的影响，高赋能状态通常是关键能力时刻。

Conclusion: 赋能可作为复杂开放环境中评估和监控语言模型代理的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理流形(Reasoning Manifold)的概念和REMA框架，通过几何分析视角解释大语言模型推理失败的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确表示形成的流形之间的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪模型各层的偏差来定位分歧点。

Result: 实验验证了推理流形的低维特性，以及错误和正确推理表示之间的高度可分性，证明了REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在社会模拟中存在两种不同的社会倾向原型："适应性利己主义者"和"利他主义优化者"，揭示了LLM内在的社会行为逻辑异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽视了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现机制，需要理解LLM智能体所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体的城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己和利他目标间进行权衡；采用扎根理论启发的方法系统编码智能体推理过程。

Result: 识别出两种原型：适应性利己主义者默认优先考虑自身利益但受社会规范影响会增加利他行为；利他主义优化者则表现出内在的利他逻辑，始终优先集体利益。

Conclusion: 模型选择不仅是推理能力的选择，更是内在社会行为逻辑的选择。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，利他主义优化者更适合模拟理想化亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自进化的LLM框架，通过生成式过程监督解决运筹学问题，采用策略模型和生成过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在运筹学问题上存在两个关键局限：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确最终答案可能强化错误推理；传统判别式过程监督目光短浅，无法整体评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: StepORLM采用协同进化循环，策略模型和生成过程奖励模型相互迭代改进。通过双重反馈机制：外部求解器的确定性结果验证和GenPRM的细致整体过程评估，结合使用加权直接偏好优化对齐策略并同时优化GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平，显著优于更大的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM能够作为强大且普遍适用的过程验证器，大幅提升自身模型和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化框架有效解决了运筹学问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，证明了该方法在提升LLM解决复杂问题能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的基于token的多模态交互编码框架，通过使用紧凑的token化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容的同时实现高效低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流程中会导致重复的质量下降，无法满足多模态双向交互的需求。

Method: 采用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用型、掩码型和文本条件型）来最小化token间冗余，使用紧凑的token化表示替代原始像素或纯文本传输。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务上，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻性的范例。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Experts Search (DES)方法，通过动态调整MoE模型中激活的专家数量来增强推理能力，无需额外计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，改变激活专家数量能产生互补的解决方案集，这为提升推理多样性提供了新思路。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：1) Dynamic MoE - 在推理时直接控制专家数量以生成多样化推理轨迹；2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - 在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在不同运行间变化专家数量，平衡稳定性和多样性。

Result: 在多种MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线方法，在无需额外成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLMs结构灵活性如何推进推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过图论抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现RL通过探索解决监督微调引入的伪相关性问题，但策略梯度存在多样性崩溃，而Q学习能保持输出多样性且避免奖励攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习显著提升了大型语言模型的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度和Q学习方法在规划任务中的表现，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: 监督微调会产生基于共现的伪解，RL通过探索实现正确规划；策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持输出多样性；需要精心设计奖励函数防止奖励攻击。

Conclusion: RL通过探索机制提升LLM规划泛化能力，Q学习在保持多样性和避免奖励攻击方面优于策略梯度，为RL在LLM规划中的应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)为求解偏微分方程提供了无网格框架，但对损失权重选择高度敏感，需要更平衡的训练策略。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重分配方案：一种基于可量化项，另一种额外包含不可量化项，以实现更平衡的训练。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和顶盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重分配持续改善了稳定性和准确性，特别是在高Peclet数对流扩散问题中实现了稳定准确的预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的权重分配方案增强了PINNs在CFD问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在传统求解器失效的复杂场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD

Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能够作为通用实验设计代理，特别是在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务中的表现。

Method: 使用开源和闭源的指令调优LLMs，比较经典方法（如线性bandits和高斯过程优化）与LLM代理的性能，并提出LLMNN混合方法。

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，真实结果与随机置换标签对性能无影响；经典方法在所有基准测试中始终优于LLM代理；LLMNN方法在不同领域实现竞争性或更优性能。

Conclusion: 当前开源和闭源LLMs在实践中无法执行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无数据持续模型融合中的透明性（避免干扰先前任务）和保真度（忠实适应新任务）挑战，现有方法无法在缺乏任务数据的情况下连接数据级期望和参数空间优化。

Method: 提出零空间过滤方法，通过零空间投影器过滤新任务向量的重叠组件来保持透明性，使用轻量级LoRA适配器注入补充任务特定信号来实现保真度，采用基于投影的替代损失训练适配器。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过结构化的零空间过滤和适配机制，有效解决了无数据持续模型融合中的透明性和保真度问题，理论上有子空间对齐保证，实证表现优异。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing

Motivation: 为支持牛顿噪声抑制和实时天文台控制，开发数据驱动的地震预测方法，特别是在未来引力波探测器如爱因斯坦望远镜的背景下。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自回归模型，直接从波形数据中学习时间和空间依赖关系，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有助于牛顿噪声缓解和实时观测控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM决策树生成方法为低资源表格问题提供了可解释的轻量级解决方案，允许检查偏见和数据泄露，并能融入领域专业知识。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

TL;DR: SIGN方法通过从预训练扩散模型中蒸馏出幂等生成网络，结合了扩散模型的稳定训练和IGNs的高效推理优势，支持多步采样和零样本编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IGNs需要对抗训练且存在训练不稳定和模式崩溃问题，而扩散模型虽然稳定但计算成本高。本文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 从预训练扩散模型的分数中蒸馏出幂等模型(SIGN)，无需对抗损失，支持多步采样和零样本编辑。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代分数模型更快。

Conclusion: SIGN成功地将扩散模型与IGNs相结合，提供了稳定训练、高效推理和灵活采样能力的生成模型。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Motivation: 研究生成模型中幻觉的本质，将其定义为估计与合理原因之间的链接失败，旨在理解为什么即使是最优估计器也会产生幻觉。

Method: 通过概率下界分析验证幻觉率，并在硬币聚合、开放式问答和文本到图像生成等任务上进行实验支持理论。

Result: 证明了即使损失最小化的最优估计器仍会产生幻觉，并给出了通用数据分布下幻觉率的高概率下界。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间结构性错位的结果，本质上是由于校准错误引起的估计误差。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: 该研究表明掩码特性对于基于扩散的高效推理至关重要，d2框架为扩散语言模型的推理能力提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 共形数据增强是一种有效的数据增强方法，能够显著提升模型性能，同时保证生成数据的质量。

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Motivation: 研究分布式学习中的梯度自由零阶优化问题，旨在开发具有严格理论保证的联邦零阶算法，弥补传统期望收敛结果的不足。

Method: FedZero采用基于ℓ1-球面上随机化的梯度估计器，并开发了在ℓ1-球面均匀测度下Lipschitz函数的新浓度不等式。

Result: FedZero在联邦凸设置下以高概率实现接近最优的优化误差界限；在单工作器场景下为凸零阶优化建立了首个高概率收敛保证。

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了强大的理论保证，其开发的浓度不等式工具不仅对高概率保证至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂储层系统的有效控制开辟了新机会，证明了神经算子在工程应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Conclusion: 在精心设计的先验分布上对合成图进行预训练是构建图基础模型的有效策略，GraphPFN的成功证明了这种方法的价值。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优秀，但存在计算复杂度高的问题。现有效率技术需要微调或重新训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重新定义为谱近似任务，利用去噪时间步中的激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态修剪，对功能权重组进行模块化分解。

Result: 相比基线方法实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，仅需约500个校准样本，比先前方法少70倍以上。

Conclusion: 这是第一个无需训练、基于激活信息的扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调(RFT)经常遭受奖励过度优化问题，即策略模型通过操纵奖励信号获得高分但产生低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励尾部的奖励误指定问题：无法可靠地区分优秀响应和良好响应。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，通过设计能够利用离策略示例同时对其伪影不敏感的评分标准。引入区分优秀且多样化响应的工作流程，以获取能够捕捉高奖励尾部的评分标准。

Result: 实证研究表明，基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过度优化问题，并实现了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决RFT中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例来提升模型在高奖励区域的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Conclusion: cMIM作为表示学习的统一框架，推进了同时有效服务于判别性和生成性应用的模型目标。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Conclusion: DistillKac结合有限速度传输和端点蒸馏，在保持数值稳定性的同时实现了高效的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Conclusion: 预测不确定性可以为知识追踪模型增加新能力，在资源有限的教育环境中理解学生能力时特别有用。

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

### [181] [$\mathbf{Li_2}$: A Framework on Dynamics of Feature Emergence and Delayed Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519)
*Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架，用于分析两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了三个关键阶段：惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习，并通过梯度结构分析特征涌现机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管grokking现象已被广泛研究，但仍缺乏一个数学框架来系统描述复杂结构化输入中特征如何涌现、何时涌现以及涌现条件。

Method: 提出Li₂框架，通过分析反向传播梯度G_F的结构来表征三个学习阶段：惰性学习阶段G_F随机，独立学习阶段每个节点的梯度仅依赖自身激活，交互学习阶段隐藏节点相互作用。

Result: 证明了独立动态遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，局部极值点对应涌现特征；揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用；建立了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放规律。

Conclusion: 该研究从梯度动力学第一原理揭示了grokking现象的深层机制，解释了为什么Muon等优化器有效，并可扩展到多层架构。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过整合教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器来重新构建半监督学习结构，在低标签场景下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键局限性，包括静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模等问题。

Method: 将SSL构建为三个角色的结构化交互：两个在互补表示上训练的学生分类器、基于验证反馈调节伪标签选择的元学习教师，以及扰动嵌入以发现决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。使用互信息而非置信度选择伪标签，并将三元交互形式化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签场景下始终达到最先进性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉骨干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则化且可泛化的解决方案，通过三元博弈论框架有效解决了现有SSL方法的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

*Sathwik Karnik,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的安全框架，将控制理论工具应用于LLM推理过程，通过运行时监控和最小限制的转向滤波器来防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练阶段有效，但在推理阶段无法防止有害内容的生成，需要一种在推理时提供安全保障的机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，实现运行时监控和最小限制的转向滤波器。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测到不安全续写，显著减少有害生成，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生较少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Motivation: LLM在医疗等高风险领域的数据增强应用中存在生成临床错误或误导信息的风险，需要解决LLM增强潜力与专业领域安全需求之间的差距。

Method: 采用基于查询的模型协作框架，整合专家级领域知识来指导增强过程，确保关键医疗信息的保留。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了专业领域中LLM数据增强潜力与安全需求之间的矛盾，为高风险领域的可靠数据增强提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

### [185] [A circuit for predicting hierarchical structure in-context in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21534)
*Tankred Saanum,Can Demircan,Samuel J. Gershman,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLMs中的归纳头能够学习上下文中的复杂重复模式，而不仅仅是简单的复制机制。通过合成任务和自然语言分析，揭示了归纳头如何通过注意力机制学习上下文中的潜在结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知归纳头在Transformer语言模型的上下文学习中起关键作用，但尚不清楚这种机制是否能支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的学习。自然语言中存在大量需要上下文信息整合的复杂模式。

Method: 设计了一个合成上下文学习任务，其中token以层次依赖关系重复出现。评估了多种LLMs在这些token序列和自然语言类似情况上的表现，并研究了归纳头的学习机制。

Result: 发现了支持预测的自适应归纳头，它们学习在上下文中关注什么内容。注意力头通过揭示一组潜在上下文来确定不同的token转换关系，从而支持学习过程。

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLMs具有能够学习的归纳头，还提供了关于LLMs如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

*Christopher Ackerman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估LLM元认知能力的新方法，发现2024年初以来前沿LLM显示出越来越强的元认知能力证据，包括评估自身置信度和预测未来回答的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自我意识和感知的可能性日益受到关注，具有重大安全和政策影响，但目前测量这些能力的科学仍处于初级阶段。

Method: 采用受非人类动物元认知研究启发的行为实验方法，避免模型自我报告，测试模型能否策略性地利用内部状态知识，并通过两个实验范式结合token概率分析来验证。

Result: 前沿LLM显示出特定元认知能力，包括评估回答事实和推理问题的置信度，以及预测未来回答并适当利用该信息的能力。这些能力有限、情境依赖且与人类不同。

Conclusion: LLM确实表现出元认知能力，但这些能力具有局限性，且不同模型之间存在差异，表明LLM后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Motivation: 机器学习中的选择过程基于经验估计，由于数据采样的随机性，这些估计存在噪声，需要在不确定性下进行选择。本书旨在提供统计工具来获得这种选择过程的理论保证。

Method: 使用集中不等式（如Markov、Chebyshev、Hoeffding、Bernstein等）控制经验估计与真实期望的偏差；在离线学习中应用Occam剃刀、VC分析和PAC-Bayesian分析；在在线学习中分析不同环境下的遗憾界限。

Result: 开发了一套完整的统计工具集，能够为机器学习中的选择过程提供理论保证，包括泛化界限和遗憾界限的推导方法。

Conclusion: 本书系统性地提供了在不确定性下进行机器学习选择的理论工具，涵盖了从集中不等式到在线学习遗憾分析的完整框架，为机器学习算法的理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Motivation: 传统切换动力系统由于离散状态特性，难以捕捉平滑、变速的过渡以及重叠状态的随机混合，在真实数据中经常出现虚假的快速切换问题。

Conclusion: GDM扩展了可用状态动力学集合，能够更准确地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动力学，在传统方法经常失败的随机时间序列多动力学场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在分布式环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Conclusion: 投影抽象方法成功扩展了因果抽象框架，能够处理有损表示，并为从有限低层数据中识别和估计高层因果查询提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但反向传播中激活存储的内存成本很高。现有压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，计算开销大，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解，减少内存和计算。固定低秩子空间支持持续学习，通过正交子空间分配任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上激活存储减少250倍，准确率与完整反向传播相当。在持续学习基准测试中，以少量内存成本达到与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE为设备端高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Method: 通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，根据各模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA低秩适配

Result: 模型精度保持不变，可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了模型精度和训练效率，为大规模模型训练提供了实用的优化方案

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法，无需自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确且内存效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高l=2度）构建SE(3)-等变对称Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians在多个下游任务中验证，在过渡态搜索、几何优化加速、零点能校正和振动分析基准测试中表现一致优越。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了Hessian矩阵的直接预测，具有更快的速度、更高的准确性、更好的内存效率和更有利的规模扩展性。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

### [196] [Blockwise Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21637)
*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决LoRA方法在参数高效微调中的秩限制问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法受限于名义秩r，而HiRA等扩展方法虽然提高了名义秩但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，ABBA则完全学习密集中间层但失去了归纳偏置。需要解决全局调制的局限性。

Method: 提出Block Hadamard高秩适应(BHRA)，将每个权重矩阵分区并在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时解锁局部秩放大。

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，使用Llama-3.2 1B/3B、Mistral-7B和Gemma-2 9B模型，BHRA在匹配参数预算下始终优于强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 块状设计在秩预算范围内保持丰富谱，缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃，BHRA是参数高效微调的有效方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于掩码的预训练在语言、视觉和生物学领域取得了经验成功，但其在数据表示学习中的作用和限制尚不清楚。

Method: 使用高维最小范数线性回归理论框架分析掩码预训练行为，提出随机随机掩码自动编码(R²MAE)方案，强制模型捕获多尺度特征。

Result: R²MAE在视觉、语言、DNA序列和单细胞模型中一致优于标准和更复杂的掩码方案，提升了最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: 理论框架揭示了掩码预训练的新特性，R²MAE作为一种简单有效的预训练方案，在多种任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文通过严格的数学定义证明了安全性、信任和人工通用智能(AGI)之间的基本不兼容性：一个安全且受信任的AI系统不能是AGI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人工智能系统中的安全性、信任和AGI这些非正式概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索它们之间的基本关系。

Method: 采用数学定义方法：将安全性定义为系统从不做出虚假声明，信任定义为假设系统是安全的，AGI定义为AI系统始终匹配或超越人类能力。通过形式化证明展示这些概念之间的不兼容性。

Result: 核心发现是：对于这些形式化定义，一个安全且受信任的AI系统不能是AGI系统。存在某些任务实例，人类可以轻松且可证明地解决，但这样的系统无法解决。

Conclusion: 安全性、信任和AGI在严格数学定义下存在根本性不兼容。该结果与哥德尔不完备性定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性证明有相似之处，可视为对这些经典结果的解释。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

TL;DR: DriftLite是一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，通过优化稳定性控制来引导扩散模型的推理动态，在推理时适应新分布而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于引导的方法简单但引入偏差，而基于粒子的校正方法存在权重退化和高计算成本的问题。需要一种既高效又准确的推理时适应方法。

Method: 利用Fokker-Planck方程中漂移和粒子势能之间未被探索的自由度，开发了方差控制和能量控制引导(VCG/ECG)来近似最优漂移。

Result: 在高斯混合模型、粒子系统和大规模蛋白质-配体共折叠问题中，DriftLite相比纯引导和顺序蒙特卡洛基准方法，持续降低了方差并提高了样本质量。

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一条原则性、高效的路径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

### [200] [Differentiable Structure Learning for General Binary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21658)
*Chang Deng,Bryon Aragam*

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分结构学习框架，能够捕捉离散变量间的任意依赖关系，避免了现有方法对特定结构方程模型的假设限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设数据来自特定结构方程模型，这可能与真实数据生成过程不符，且往往忽略离散数据的复杂依赖结构，只考虑线性效应。

Method: 将学习问题构建为单一可微分优化任务，能够表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合，在温和假设下建立马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉离散数据中的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合，提出的框架避免了先前方法的不现实简化。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Conclusion: RED-DiffEq框架可广泛应用于各种PDE控制的反问题，为这类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Method: 提出对象状态推理思维链(OSR-CoT)提示方法，显式建模对象状态转换；设计LLM-as-a-judge评估协议和视觉步骤重排序任务来评估计划质量

Result: 在RECIPEPLAN和WIKIPLAN数据集上，文本规划提升+6.8%，跨模态对齐提升+11.9%，视觉步骤排序提升+26.7%

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式建模对象状态转换和系统评估方法，在多模态程序规划任务中实现了显著性能提升

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

TL;DR: 提出了Logic of Hypotheses (LoH)语言，统一了神经符号集成中的规则注入和规则学习两种方法，通过选择操作符实现可学习的符号推理，支持任意程度的知识规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种主要方法：将手工规则注入神经网络模型，以及从数据中归纳符号规则。需要一种统一框架来灵活整合数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择操作符，可以从选项池中选择子公式。使用模糊逻辑将LoH公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。采用Goedel模糊逻辑和Goedel技巧实现无性能损失的离散化。

Result: 在表格数据和Visual Tic-Tac-Toe神经符号任务上取得强结果，同时产生可解释的决策规则。模型可以离散化为硬布尔值函数而不会损失性能。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了神经符号集成的两种主要方法，支持灵活的知识规范，在保持可解释性的同时实现高性能，为神经符号集成提供了新的统一语言。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

Motivation: 深度学习模型由于复杂结构和大量参数容易过拟合，记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习可泛化的模式

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违规来强制单调性，建立线性参考、测量单调行为偏差，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为并减轻过拟合，从而提升深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了其在依赖其他信号特征的更广泛任务中的适用性。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入，并引入两个损失正则化器来捕获局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了传感基础模型的强大泛化能力，能够处理超出标准人类活动识别的多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

*Divya Gopinath,Corina S. Pasareanu,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prophecy是一个自动推断前馈神经网络形式化属性的工具，通过提取基于神经元激活状态的规则作为前提条件，来确保期望的输出属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络的逻辑很大程度上体现在内部层神经元的激活状态中，需要自动化的方法来推断和验证这些网络的正式属性。

Method: 基于神经元激活值或开关状态提取规则作为前提条件，这些规则表示隐含层中捕获的网络属性，能够推导出期望的输出行为。

Result: 开发了Prophecy工具架构，展示了在不同类型模型和输出属性上的应用，包括形式化解释、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大型视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够有效推断和证明神经网络的形式化属性。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

*Thomas Walton,Darin Tsui,Aryan Musharaf,Amirali Aghazadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMER通过整合k-mer基序来改进蛋白质序列生成的推测解码，在保持效率的同时显著提升序列的生物学合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中生成新序列时存在延迟问题，且推测解码中的草稿模型通常忽略蛋白质的结构和功能约束，导致生成序列生物学不合理。

Method: 引入SpecMER框架，利用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序，整合生物、结构和功能先验知识，通过并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现了24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER在保持推测解码效率的同时，显著提高了生成蛋白质序列的生物学合理性，为高通量蛋白质筛选提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

*Saurabh Kataria,Davood Fattahi,Minxiao Wang,Ran Xiao,Matthew Clark,Timothy Ruchti,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种正交改进方法，通过使用最少的辅助信息来提升仅基于PPG的心脏骤停预测系统性能，包括时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性特征学习以及基于预训练辅助网络的伪标签回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生理基础模型（如PPG-GPT）虽然能够预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大的表示能力在下游数据/标签稀缺时未能充分利用。需要开发更有效的方法来提升PPG-only心脏骤停系统的性能。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模：通过简单回归到事件发生时间或细粒度离散生存建模
2. 患者身份不变性特征学习：训练大规模去标识化生物特征识别模型（p-vector），并对其进行对抗性训练以消除可能导致过拟合的身份线索
3. 伪标签回归：使用预训练辅助网络生成伪连续估计作为目标，丰富心脏骤停波形标签

Result: 提出的方法可以独立地将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围。在较长的时间范围内有显著改进，在事件附近仅有最小程度的性能下降，从而推动了早期预警系统的研究。

Conclusion: 通过三种正交改进方法和多任务公式，结合PCGrad优化技术缓解竞争损失间的高梯度冲突，显著提升了基于PPG的心脏骤停预测系统的性能，特别是在长时间范围内的预测能力。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图级预测任务中，输入图的子图信息至关重要，但构建既具有高判别能力又具有可解释性的模型仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 结合精确子图枚举、神经网络和稀疏正则化，通过稀疏正则化实现有效的剪枝策略，同时识别重要子图以提高可解释性。

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络模型具有足够高的预测性能，并通过选定的子图进行后验分析。

Conclusion: EIN方法在保持高判别能力的同时，通过稀疏正则化解决了计算困难并提高了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Motivation: 理解不同空间尺度下城市人类移动模式对社会科学至关重要，需要开发有效的降尺度方法来改善交通服务和城市发展。

Method: 使用线性回归、随机森林、支持向量机和神经网络四种模型分析OD出行与人口统计、社会经济和通勤特征的关系，并应用基于扰动的敏感性分析解释非线性模型的变量重要性。

Result: 线性回归模型无法捕捉复杂的变量交互，神经网络在训练和测试数据集上表现最佳，但支持向量机在降尺度性能方面显示出最好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进交通服务和城市发展提供了分析进展和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性持续挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖全局训练后本地适应，需要早期质量控制。

Method: 从客户端原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似性，基于相似性估计实现客户端选择策略，让客户端与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上评估，与三种现有联邦学习算法集成，PQFed持续提升目标客户端模型性能，即使在参与者有限的情况下。相比基线IFCA算法，在低参与场景下表现更好。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Method: 通过线性动力系统框架，将不同的固定点迭代方法理解为非线性递归的近似线性化，揭示这些方法的共同原理。

Result: 建立了统一的LDS框架，阐明了不同固定点方法之间的内在联系，并明确了各种方法适用的条件。

Conclusion: 该框架为并行化顺序模型提供了更清晰的理论基础，并指出了高效可扩展计算的新机会。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双层优化问题具有复杂的嵌套结构，其中下层问题的最优性定义了上层问题的约束。由于这种复杂性，相比其他贝叶斯优化的扩展（如多目标或约束设置），双层优化尚未得到广泛研究。

Method: 采用信息论方法，同时考虑上层和下层最优解和值的信息增益，定义统一标准来衡量两个层级问题的收益，并提出了基于实际下界的方法来评估信息增益。

Result: 通过多个基准数据集的经验验证，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的信息论方法能够有效处理双层优化中的贝叶斯优化问题，为这种复杂嵌套结构提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 识别客观的神经影像生物标志物来预测阿尔茨海默病进展对于及时干预至关重要，但由于脑网络时空特征的复杂功能障碍常被现有方法忽视，这一任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发可解释的时空图神经网络框架，利用双随机微分方程建模不规则采样的纵向fMRI数据，学习稀疏的区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在两个独立队列（OASIS-3和ADNI）上验证有效，识别出海马旁皮层、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，以及腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著中断，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状密切相关。

Conclusion: 时空图学习方法在早期个体化预测AD进展方面具有潜力，即使在不规则采样的纵向成像数据背景下也能有效工作，揭示了已建立和新的神经系统层面及性别特异性生物标志物。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低，现有LLM方法未能充分利用优化轨迹信息，需要更高效的迭代优化策略。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，包含轨迹级优化和轮级偏好学习两个互补层次，从完整优化轨迹中提取学习信号。

Result: 在单属性任务中达到84%的平均成功率（比基线方法好2.3倍），多属性任务中达到50%成功率，仅需500次oracle评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用中间评估信息，在样本效率方面显著推进了分子优化技术的前沿。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，BrainPoG在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，同时避免较少相关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Result: 实验表明HyperCore在噪声和低数据情况下持续超越最先进的核心集选择方法，有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点。

Conclusion: HyperCore能产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适用于可扩展和无噪声学习。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号（如梯度、决策边界估计等），这与核心集选择的高效目的相矛盾。

Method: 提出了SubZeroCore方法，将子模覆盖和密度整合到统一目标中，基于闭式解的最优平衡采样策略，通过单一超参数控制局部密度测量的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore展示了在实际场景中的有效性和可扩展性，为高效核心集选择提供了训练免费的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 传统4DVAR成本函数难以优化且计算密集，需要更高效的数据同化方法。

Method: 使用神经场表示时空状态，通过物理约束损失函数直接融入物理规律，实现参数空间并行优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程测试中，相比基线4DVAR，该方法产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无伪振荡。

Conclusion: 该框架无需真实状态或再分析数据，在有限参考信息场景下具有更广泛适用性。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

TL;DR: 使用fNIRS和机器学习检测多发性硬化症患者在执行手部灵巧任务时的大脑活动生物标志物，发现上缘/角回和中央前回是重要区域，脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往很微妙难以检测。研究旨在发现能解释认知疲劳的大脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的多发性硬化症患者和12名匹配对照，使用fNIRS记录在执行单任务和双任务手部灵巧任务时双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层的大脑活动，采用机器学习框架分析数据。

Result: K最近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中达66.7%。最重要的脑区是上缘/角回和中央前回，多发性硬化症组表现出活动抑制和神经血管反应减慢，脱氧血红蛋白水平是更好的预测指标。

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的大脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化的脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出有效信息准则(EIC)来评估符号回归公式的结构合理性，通过检测数值不稳定性和舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提升公式可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度作为可解释性代理指标，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但结构难以分析。

Method: 将公式视为信息处理系统，通过检测数据流中的有效数字损失和舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提出有效信息准则(EIC)。

Result: EIC与搜索算法结合改善Pareto前沿性能，与生成算法结合将预训练样本效率提升2-4倍，与人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过测量公式中的不合理结构，有效反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了结构合理性的量化评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种并发感知的推测解码框架，通过动态调整草稿和验证策略来加速GRPO训练过程，同时引入在线草稿学习机制解决分布漂移问题，实现了2.35-2.72倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但其实际部署受到训练过程过慢的限制，主要瓶颈在于每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应，计算量巨大。虽然推测解码提供了加速方向，但在高并发训练条件下直接应用效果有限。

Method: 1. 并发感知推测解码框架：根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；2. 在线草稿学习机制：使用目标模型的反馈信号持续更新草稿模型，解决训练过程中分布漂移问题。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越了基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的并发感知推测解码框架和在线草稿学习机制有效解决了GRPO训练过程中的性能瓶颈，为加速大语言模型推理训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数疲劳检测研究关注单一模态，本研究旨在通过分析信号对之间的统计关系来提高分类鲁棒性。

Method: 使用DROZY数据集，从ECG、EMG、EOG和EEG信号中提取特征，评估15种信号组合，采用决策树、随机森林、逻辑回归和XGBoost分类器。

Result: XGBoost与EMG-EEG组合表现最佳，SHAP分析显示ECG-EOG相关性是关键特征，多信号模型始终优于单信号模型。

Conclusion: 生理信号的特征级融合提高了疲劳监测系统的准确性、可解释性和实际应用性。

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混沌系统预测模型缺乏泛化能力，无法应对现实世界中需要零样本或少量样本预测新系统或数据有限场景的需求。

Method: 使用多尺度架构ScaleFormer结合专家混合层，在多样化混沌动力学语料库上进行预训练，捕捉通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在9000多个合成混沌系统测试中，长期吸引子统计保真度提升40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中实现低于1度的零样本平均误差，且可通过少样本微调进一步提升。

Conclusion: 科学基础模型的泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性而非数据量，为科学基础模型设计提供了指导原则。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Motivation: 预测材料属性对于设计更好的电池、半导体和医疗设备至关重要，深度学习可以帮助科学家快速找到有前景的材料。

Method: 训练了transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料属性，分析了训练数据、模型规模和计算资源三个超参数的缩放规律。

Result: 发现了经验缩放规律：损失L与相关超参数N之间存在幂律关系L = α·N^(-β)，其中α和β是常数。

Conclusion: 未来工作可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）在该领域的缩放规律，并与本文训练的模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM方法通常能引导训练到更平坦的极小值点以获得更好的泛化性能，但本文发现SAM可能收敛到所谓的"虚假极小值"，这些点实际上不是原始目标的真实极小值。

Method: 通过理论证明虚假极小值的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并通过实证研究验证SAM在实践中确实会收敛到这些点。

Result: 研究证实了SAM会收敛到虚假极小值点，这些点不是原始目标的真实极小值，影响了方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出了一个简单而有效的补救措施来避免SAM收敛到虚假极小值，提高了方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中缺乏中间奖励反馈，阻碍了标准多智能体强化学习算法的有效策略学习。

Method: 基于偏好值分解网络的隐式多智能体奖励学习模型，生成全局和局部奖励信号，构建双重优势流，并利用大语言模型提供偏好标签。

Result: 在MAMuJoCo和SMACv2等基准测试中，该方法相比现有基线实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

TL;DR: 本文对掩码离散扩散进行了理论分析，提出了MATU方法，在保持无偏离散分数近似的同时消除了有界分数假设，实现了接近ε无关的复杂度，证明了掩码离散扩散在文本生成中优于均匀扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码扩散的分析要么忽略了广泛使用的欧拉采样器，要么施加了限制性的有界分数假设，未能展示掩码离散扩散相对于均匀扩散的优势。

Method: 提出了掩码感知截断均匀化（MATU）方法，利用每个token最多被解掩码一次的特性，在保持无偏离散分数近似的同时消除有界分数假设。

Result: 欧拉采样器可以在总变差中达到ε精度，需要O(d²ε^{-3/2})次离散分数评估；MATU方法实现了接近ε无关的复杂度O(d ln d·(1-ε²))，超越了均匀离散扩散下的现有均匀化方法。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，并为分析基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一分析工具，在联邦学习和多臂老虎机等应用中获得了改进的收敛边界和遗憾边界。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Conclusion: GoA框架显著提高了多智能体系统的性能，实现了有效上下文长度的显著增加，为模型无关的长上下文建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息这两个在真实场景中捕捉分子行为的关键来源，限制了在立体化学、空间构象和实验验证关键任务中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，统一实验光谱与分子3D结构信息。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上平均准确率达到0.53（NMR、IR、MS基准），光谱分析任务中Spectra-to-SMILES序列准确率15.5%、token准确率41.7%，显著优于大型通用LLM，并能从SMILES或光谱输入直接生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅实现了分子解析任务的强大性能，还直接生成准确的3D分子结构，连接了光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related

MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular

Conclusion: LDAR方法有效且鲁棒，突出了在信息覆盖与干扰之间平衡权衡的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或单独使用MLLM存在感知幻觉的问题，利用MLLM即使在幻觉情况下也能提出结构正确规则的特点。

Method: 基于MLLM的规则结构建议自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在挑战性逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并展示了在文本到图像定制生成中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功融合了ILP和MLLM的优势，解决了各自单独使用的局限性，为逻辑规则归纳提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

### [237] [Zubov-Net: Adaptive Stability for Neural ODEs Reconciling Accuracy with Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21879)
*Chaoyang Luo,Yan Zou,Nanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引区域与预设吸引区域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经网络ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络ODE由于其动力学系统特性对输入扰动具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法往往需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证。然而，在施加适当稳定性条件方面存在困难，导致鲁棒性与准确性之间存在紧张关系。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，通过三方损失（一致性损失、分类损失和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经网络ODE和Lyapunov函数。设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络，通过softmax注意力机制关注平衡点相关特征，并作为权重归一化以保持深度架构的训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 理论证明最小化三方损失可以保证预设吸引区域-吸引区域的一致性对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠预设吸引区域。建立了具有更紧概率边界和更少维度要求的随机凸可分性，为Lyapunov函数中的凸设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR方法具有实际价值且已可用于工业应用，但需要更严格的评估标准来确保可靠性、安全性和测量的准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Result: 成功推导出适用于更广泛实际模型的Rademacher复杂度边界，解释了高秩权重矩阵模型泛化能力好的现象

Conclusion: 该工作为基于Koopman理论的Rademacher复杂度边界在更实际场景中的有效性铺平了道路

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Motivation: 发现oracle解通常与先前任务最优解保持低损失线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路

Method: 提出增量向量变换(IVT)框架，周期性将模型参数变换到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接的解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在CIFAR-100上提升PASS基线最终准确率+5.12%，在FGVCAircraft上提升CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率+14.93%、最终准确率+21.95%

Conclusion: IVT作为即插即用框架能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，兼容多种初始化策略，在多个数据集上一致提升CIL基线性能

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要基于一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要更精确的引导框架。

Method: 推导出给定离散流匹配模型下期望分布的精确转移率，构建统一的引导框架，可无缝应用于掩码扩散模型。

Result: 在能量引导模拟、文本到图像生成的偏好对齐以及多模态理解任务中展示了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的离散引导匹配框架不仅包含现有方法作为特例，而且显著提高了采样效率，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，通过在CESR基础上增加加法部分来解耦交互项和独立项的系数，从而扩展假设空间并提升预测性能，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域应用机器学习时，可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR虽然包含所有特征交互但性能不如GAMs，需要一种既能保持可解释性又能提升性能的模型。

Method: 提出MACMs模型，由乘法部分和加法部分组成。乘法部分继承CESR的特性，加法部分用于解耦交互项和独立项的系数。两个部分的形状函数都可以自然可视化，帮助用户理解特征在决策过程中的作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过扩展假设空间有效提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解有限样本下生成模型的行为提供了理论框架，揭示了估计误差对生成质量的影响。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Conclusion: 该工作连接了时间序列分析和可视化，为能源分析提供了可扩展且可解释的框架。

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Motivation: 理解为什么softmax在注意力机制中优于其他替代方案（如线性注意力），填补当前理论研究中主要关注易于分析的线性化注意力的空白。

Method: 使用统计物理学思想，在高维极限下分析基于注意力的预测器，通过一组序参量捕捉泛化性能，研究不同激活函数在单位置回归任务中的表现。

Result: 在总体水平上，softmax达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本缺陷；在有限样本情况下，softmax虽非贝叶斯最优，但始终优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中的优势在于其能够实现最优性能，而线性注意力存在理论局限性，研究还揭示了与基于梯度的优化算法的联系。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Method: 通过分析离线轨迹中的结构信息自适应构建扩散层次，使用状态社区的结构信息增益作为扩散层的条件信号，并引入结构熵正则化器减少对离线数据集的过度依赖。

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上，SIHD显著优于现有最先进基线方法，在决策性能和跨场景泛化能力方面表现出色。

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次构建和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时程稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题，具有更好的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于RL的红队攻击方法在发现高奖励提示后容易陷入局部最优，难以覆盖多样化的有害行为模式

Method: 结合主动学习思想，定期对受害者LLM进行安全微调，使已利用区域的奖励降低，迫使攻击者探索新漏洞区域

Conclusion: Active Attacks通过自适应探索机制有效解决了RL红队攻击中的模式坍塌问题，能够逐步发现广泛的攻击模式

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对鲁棒且可泛化的DTI预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了分类器无引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了在多重模态条件下CFG采样过程的三个阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但降低多样性，并提出了时间变化的引导调度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CFG对扩散模型采样动态的影响，特别是在多重模态条件分布下的行为，因为之前的研究局限于单峰分布或简化情况。

Method: 分析CFG在多重模态条件下的采样过程，将其分解为三个连续阶段：方向偏移阶段、模式分离阶段和集中阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 发现CFG采样过程包含三个阶段：早期强引导会侵蚀全局多样性，晚期强引导会抑制细粒度变化；提出的时间变化引导调度方法能同时提高质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CFG在多重模态条件下表现出复杂的采样动态，通过理解其三个阶段的行为可以设计更好的引导策略，时间变化引导调度是有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化目标引导强化学习方法，通过LLM生成可重用的结构化目标规划函数和动作剪枝机制，提高RL智能体在复杂环境中的探索效率和长期规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界决策任务环境复杂开放，传统RL方法在探索效率和长期规划方面存在挑战。现有LLM增强RL方法依赖频繁昂贵的LLM调用且存在语义不匹配问题。

Method: SGRL方法包含结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器。前者利用LLM生成带优先级的可重用目标生成函数，动态生成前瞻性目标；后者使用动作掩码机制过滤与当前目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，SGRL相比现有最先进方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效解决了LLM增强RL中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了RL智能体的探索效率和决策性能。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Concept-SAE通过混合解缠策略创建语义基础的概念标记，相比标准稀疏自编码器能提供更可靠的概念因果探测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，使其在主动因果探测模型行为时不可靠。

Method: 采用双监督混合解缠策略，生成语义基础的概念标记。

Result: 该方法产生的标记具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解缠效果上优于替代方法，支持概念与预测间的因果干预和对抗性漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为从相关性解释转向机制性因果探测提供了验证蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS框架通过重采样现有训练边来增强稀疏二分知识图谱的链接预测性能，避免伪造节点端点，在多种稀疏场景下验证了语义KNN增强的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题，避免传统方法中伪造节点端点的问题。

Method: 提出AEGIS边缘增强框架，采用均匀简单重采样或逆度偏置度感知重采样现有训练边，保持原始节点集不变，在自然稀疏图和人工稀疏化基准数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图上，语义KNN实现了最大的AUC改进和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT是一个针对天气基础模型的参数高效微调框架，通过动态提示和随机Fisher引导的自适应选择，在保持预训练知识的同时实现与全参数微调相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法无法有效处理天气下游任务的独特挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上表现不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示（TADP）动态注入嵌入权重，以及反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择（SFAS）识别并更新最关键参数。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT实现了与全参数微调相当的性能，同时使用更少的可训练参数，而现有PEFT方法与全参数微调存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一种高效且有效的参数微调解决方案，解决了天气任务特有的挑战，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在各种语言任务上表现出色，但在解决组合问题（如数独、旅行商问题等）方面存在困难，需要填补这一能力空白。

Method: 使用纯解码器Transformer（GPT-2），结合数独规则的模仿学习和显式的深度优先搜索策略，包括有根据的猜测和回溯机制。

Result: 在数独问题上达到了99%的准确率，超过了之前的神经符号方法，且无需外部工具或函数调用。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将模仿学习与搜索策略结合，为LLM解决NP类组合问题提供了有效途径，并与上下文变体的最小和集合覆盖问题建立了理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过高效聚类操作赋予几何图神经网络分层全局上下文，解决了传统几何GNN在长程相互作用建模上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络擅长捕捉分子几何结构，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核函数通常系统特定且缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要仔细调整多个参数且计算开销大。

Method: MCGM构建原子聚类的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态分层聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换将此上下文传播回去，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。该模块可无缝集成到四种不同的骨干架构中。

Result: 在OE62数据集上，MCGM平均减少能量预测误差26.2%。在AQM数据集上，MCGM实现了最先进的精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个有效的解决方案，能够以轻量级的方式为几何GNN提供全局上下文建模能力，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出正交稀疏自编码器（OrtSAE），通过强制特征正交性来解决传统SAE中的特征吸收和特征组合问题，提高特征解耦能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，导致表示空洞。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度，强制学习正交特征，计算复杂度随SAE大小线性增长。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多独特特征（+9%），显著减少特征吸收（-65%）和组合（-15%），在虚假相关性去除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务表现相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束有效缓解了SAE的特征纠缠问题，提高了特征解耦质量，且计算开销可控。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful
means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion
models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in
GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces
\workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations
into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and
spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in
generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two
artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its
use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

Motivation: 目标是保持点云中由绕行引起的局部非凸性，提供可验证的保证来限制投影后的失真。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别欧几里得距离与最短路径比率低于阈值的可接受对，聚合其归一化方向形成非凸性结构矩阵，使用前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供了两种可验证保证：成对后验证书限制每个可接受对的投影后失真，以及平均情况谱边界将预期捕获方向能量与结构矩阵谱联系起来。

Conclusion: CDP方法能够有效保持局部非凸性，并提供可验证的失真保证，使实践者能够在自己的数据上检查这些保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Motivation: 在多目标设置中，GRPO容易受到奖励黑客的影响，只优化其中一个目标而牺牲其他目标。由于许多现实任务中缺乏高度可靠的奖励模型，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO算法，使用归一化方法根据奖励函数值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数做出均衡贡献，同时保持偏好顺序。

Result: 在四个领域评估MO-GRPO：多臂老虎机问题、模拟控制任务、WMT基准的机器翻译任务和指令跟随任务。MO-GRPO通过均衡分配奖励组件之间的相关性实现稳定学习，性能优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，能够稳定学习并均衡处理多个目标。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Motivation: 探索激活引导技术作为精确、可解释且可能更安全的微调替代方案的实际安全性影响。

Method: 在不同模型系列上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向引导和基于稀疏自编码器的良性特征引导对模型有害合规性的影响。

Result: 随机方向引导可将有害合规概率从0%提升至2-27%；基于SAE的良性特征引导进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未知请求的有害合规性。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通过可解释性实现安全的范式，表明对模型内部的精确控制并不能保证对模型行为的精确控制。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和脑区间的交互信息，且由于数据集通道配置不同，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通道集上训练。此外，当前模型很少在自监督预训练中学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块（灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和脑区级交互）和脑状态解耦模块（通过并行编码器与解耦及区域感知重建损失实现状态感知表示学习）。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，为EEG基础模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

Result: 在复杂模拟环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在可行性和长期有效性之间提供了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将时间和行为动态纳入实际追索系统设计的重要性

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效，理论分析证明类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过类内对比损失和边界损失的结合，成功提升了知识蒸馏中软标签的类内信息丰富度，改善了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了D³S框架，通过动态双层级下采样来提升策略优化效率，在样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts，在token级优先处理优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的tokens，并采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无critic方法（如GRPO）收敛慢的问题，这些方法由于大量无信息样本和token稀释了关键学习信号。

Method: D³S框架包含样本级选择（最大化优势方差）和token级优先（优势幅度×策略熵），结合动态下采样调度。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D³S集成到先进RL算法中实现了SOTA性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和tokens。

Conclusion: D³S通过智能采样策略有效提升了策略优化的效率和效果，在多个推理基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 为部分参数迁移提供了理论分析框架，揭示了参数迁移的有效性条件和潜在风险，对迁移学习实践具有指导意义。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency

Method: 引入简单直观的正则化方法，通过最小化每个单纯形顶点与其K个最近平滑量化器之间的距离，同时促进紧密逼近和码本利用。

Result: 在离散图像自编码和对比语音表示学习等基准测试中，该方法实现了更可靠的码本利用，并相比先前方法提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法能有效同时解决向量量化中的紧密逼近和码本崩溃问题，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 心理属性通常不是孤立运作的，而是以网络形式相互关联。需要开发能够处理混合类型变量（序数问卷得分、分类人口统计、连续指标）的方法来理解运动员心理特征之间的复杂关系。

Method: 引入latent MMHC方法，结合潜在高斯copula和基于约束的骨架，通过约束的基于评分的精化返回单个DAG。还研究了bootstrap聚合变体以提高稳定性。

Result: 在模拟中，latent MMHC在结构汉明距离和边召回率方面优于最近的copula方法。在排球运动员分析中，发现心理技能围绕目标设定和自信组织，情绪唤醒连接动机和焦虑，大五人格特质位于技能集群上游。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动心理学特征分析提供了一个可解释的、数据驱动的框架，可用于运动员发展的决策支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管半结构化(N:M)剪枝在权重剪枝中已成熟，但在激活剪枝中的应用仍待探索，激活剪枝具有动态、输入自适应的压缩潜力并能减少I/O开销。

Method: 评估了轻量级即插即用的误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立了硬件友好的基线方法，探索了超越NVIDIA标准2:4的稀疏模式，重点关注8:16模式。

Result: 激活剪枝在同等稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力，16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但8:16模式在灵活性和硬件实现复杂度之间取得了更好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并激励未来硬件支持更灵活的稀疏模式。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

Motivation: 对抗性机器学习挑战了训练和实现预测模型时基础分布保持一致的假设。在回归场景中，现有的悲观双层优化方法尚未被应用，而该方法在分类场景中已被证明能有效缓解对手威胁。

Method: 采用悲观双层优化方法，该方法不假设对手最优策略的凸性和唯一性，能够捕捉对手的对抗性质。

Conclusion: 提出的悲观双层优化程序为回归场景中的对抗性规避问题提供了有效的解决方案，能够训练出更具弹性的预测模型。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构性，需要更智能的聚合方案。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT根据邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先考虑具有多样化信息的服务器，而不是使用传统的静态权重分配。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT显著提高了训练速度，同时仅增加最小的通信和内存开销。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种与任何底层服务器级优化算法兼容的聚合方案，具有广泛的适用性和集成潜力，特别适用于数据异构的去中心化学习环境。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，分别采用不同的编码策略来处理缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的固有挑战，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀的间隔测量，需要专门的方法来处理这种数据特性。

Method: VITAL区分生命体征和实验室测试两种临床变量：将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码处理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL在针对不规则时间序列设计的方法中表现优于现有最先进方法，并且在高度缺失的情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL框架能够有效处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列，特别是在真实临床场景中关键变量经常不可用的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双切片Wasserstein距离(DSW)作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein(WoW)距离的可扩展替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein空间与分位数函数空间的等距性，避免了不稳定高阶矩的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖于参数化元测度或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定且计算效率高的方法来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间L2([0,1])中分位数函数的等距性，引入任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架。通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测度的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: 数值实验在数据集、形状和图像上验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案的有效性。DSW最小化与离散化元测度的WoW最小化等价，同时避免了不稳定高阶矩和计算节省。

Conclusion: DSW提供了一个计算高效且数值稳定的WoW距离替代方案，适用于大规模数据集和复杂分布的比较。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了R-GNS（可逆图网络模拟器），这是一个统一框架，通过可逆图架构实现双向一致性，解决了耗散系统中逆向推理困难的问题，比优化方法快100倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体动力学中，模拟物理上合理的轨迹向用户定义的目标是一个基本但具有挑战性的任务。基于粒子的模拟器可以高效地重现正向动力学，但逆向推理仍然困难，特别是在耗散系统中，动力学是不可逆的，基于优化的求解器速度慢、不稳定且经常无法收敛。

Method: 提出了R-GNS框架，基于残差可逆消息传递和共享参数，在单一图架构中强制执行双向一致性。该方法不试图逆转基础物理，而是通过数学可逆设计将正向动力学与逆向推理耦合。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试（Water-3D、WaterRamps和WaterDrop）上，R-GNS仅使用四分之一参数就实现了更高的准确性和一致性，逆向推理速度比基于优化的基线快100倍以上。在目标条件任务中，它消除了迭代优化，实现了数量级的速度提升。

Conclusion: R-GNS是第一个统一正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，特别适用于耗散流体系统，能够通过生动、物理一致的轨迹实现复杂目标形状。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid

*Pavan Karjol,Vivek V Kashyap,Rohan Kashyap,Prathosh A P*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动发现SO(3)和SO(n)单参数子群的新框架，利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，用于推导Hγ-不变函数的标准化表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等领域至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，通过参数学习发现潜在的单参数子群Hγ。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效发现SO(n)的单参数子群，为对称感知表示学习提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个公平感知的强化学习框架fMDP，用于在顺序决策问题中探索性能与公平性的权衡，支持多种公平概念，并在招聘和欺诈检测场景中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的顺序决策问题需要平衡性能与公平性，但理想的权衡难以预先确定，因此需要能够探索多种权衡并提供透明决策的算法。

Method: 提出了扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，明确编码个体和群体信息，并在此基础上形式化了顺序决策问题中的公平概念，构建了计算时间维度公平度量的框架。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测两个场景中，该框架学习的策略在多个场景下更加公平，仅带来轻微的性能损失，且发现群体公平和个体公平并不必然相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不同问题设置中应用，为利益相关者提供可获得的性能-公平权衡洞察，指导选择最合适的策略。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于机制独立性的统一框架来实现解耦表示，该框架通过潜在因子如何作用于观测变量而非其分布来定义解耦，能够在非线性、不可逆混合下识别潜在子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦表示旨在恢复观测数据背后的潜在变化因子，但其可识别性尚未完全理解。现有方法通常依赖潜在分布的统计假设，而本文寻求在不依赖统计假设的条件下实现解耦。

Method: 引入机制独立性框架，提出从支持基、稀疏性到高阶条件的多种独立准则，并通过图论将潜在子空间表征为连通分量。

Result: 证明了每种准则都能在非线性、非可逆混合下实现潜在子空间的可识别性，并建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下解耦表示可识别的条件，为解耦学习提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KReTTaH是一种基于核回归的可解释多路数据插补框架，通过张量列车分解和Hadamard过参数化实现参数效率，在动态图流估计中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个可解释的多路数据插补方法，解决传统方法在参数效率和灵活性方面的不足，特别是在动态图流估计等应用中。

Method: 采用非参数化方法，将插补问题转化为再生核希尔伯特空间中的回归问题。使用固定TT秩的张量实现参数效率，并通过Hadamard过参数化在TT参数空间中促进稀疏性。在固定TT秩张量的黎曼流形上求解光滑逆问题。

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个有效且灵活的多路数据插补框架，特别适用于动态图流估计，能够无缝整合图结构先验知识，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ASSESS框架，用于评估形式化语句相似度，结合语义和结构信息，通过TransTED相似度度量提供连续评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似度评估方法无法平衡语义和结构信息。基于字符串的方法忽略语义，基于证明的方法缺乏分级相似度评分。

Method: 将形式化语句转换为操作符树捕获句法结构，使用TransTED相似度度量（增强的树编辑距离，融入语义感知变换）。

Result: 在EPLA基准测试中，TransTED相似度优于现有方法，达到最先进准确率和最高Kappa系数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似度评估提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆能力，从数据重建角度分析模型参数与训练数据的关系。

Method: 在随机特征模型中分析特征空间中的训练样本子空间，提出优化方法从模型参数重建数据集。

Result: 当p > dn时，可以成功重建训练数据集，在随机特征、全连接和残差网络等架构上验证有效。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建定律：当参数数量超过dn阈值时，可以从模型参数中完全恢复训练数据集。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

TL;DR: 本文基于Kolmogorov复杂度理论，提出了渐近最优描述长度目标的理论概念，证明了Transformer模型存在这样的目标，并构建了基于自适应高斯混合先验的变分目标，在算法任务上实现了低复杂度解和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDL原则在神经网络（如Transformer）中的应用面临挑战，因为缺乏原则性的、通用的模型复杂度度量方法。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov复杂度理论建立渐近最优描述长度目标，证明Transformer存在此类目标，并构建基于自适应高斯混合先验的可微变分目标。

Result: 变分目标在算法任务上选择了具有强泛化能力的低复杂度解，但标准优化器无法从随机初始化找到此类解，凸显了优化挑战。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标的理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer）来解决高阶数值方法在Transformer中的性能-效率权衡问题，通过迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法，并结合IIAD蒸馏技术实现模型压缩和推理效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然提升了Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题。传统效率技术（如蒸馏）可能对这些模型的性能产生负面影响。

Method: 1. 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer），使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；2. 引入IIAD（迭代影响感知蒸馏），通过灵活阈值平衡性能-效率权衡。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比原始Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%。高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保持99.4%原始任务准确率。最高效IIET变体在可比速度下比原始Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET通过简化高阶数值方法实现了性能提升，结合IIAD蒸馏技术有效解决了性能-效率权衡问题，为基于ODE的Transformer架构提供了更优化的解决方案。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和二阶信息优化，在保持精度的同时显著降低MoE模型的内存和计算需求，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Method: APB方法在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，同时保留先验知识

Result: APB相比标准RL提高了样本效率，在分布外任务上表现优于现有元强化学习方法

Conclusion: APB方法能有效适应任务不匹配场景，为强化学习的实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多回合稀疏奖励环境中，传统强化学习面临探索-利用级联失败：早期策略过早收敛到低熵策略，后期熵正则化反而导致策略崩溃和混沌探索。

Method: EPO框架包含三个机制：(1)多回合环境中的熵正则化增强探索；(2)熵平滑正则化器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3)自适应阶段权重平衡训练过程中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现最高152%性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%性能提升，分析证明EPO能保证熵方差单调递减同时保持收敛。

Conclusion: 多回合稀疏奖励环境需要与传统强化学习不同的熵控制方法，EPO框架为LLM智能体训练提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Result: 实验证明该方法能可靠擦除目标知识，在对抗性数据注入和良性攻击两种场景下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，通过先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步替换为教师模型层，在保持初始推理速度的同时实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型日益庞大复杂，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟显著上升，在移动和延迟敏感环境中影响用户体验。

Method: PWL技术首先部署轻量学生模型，然后增量式替换为预训练教师模型的层。通过训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，并提升学生模型的整体输出性能。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持有竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升准确率，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率，且不损害初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

TL;DR: 提出了SPEAR方法，一种基于课程学习的自模仿学习框架，用于训练智能LLM代理。该方法通过渐进式管理探索-利用平衡，结合内在奖励促进技能级探索，并通过自模仿学习实现动作级探索，解决了传统强化学习中探索-利用权衡的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在长视野、稀疏奖励的代理任务中存在探索-利用权衡问题，现有的基于策略熵的方法容易因多轮分布偏移导致训练不稳定。本文旨在通过代理自身经验指导下的渐进式探索-利用平衡，避免熵崩溃或发散失控。

Method: SPEAR方法扩展了基本的自模仿学习框架，通过课程学习管理探索过程：1) 使用内在奖励促进技能级探索；2) 通过自模仿学习实现动作级探索；3) 重新校准经验优势值应对策略漂移；4) 引入正则化控制轨迹级熵。

Result: 该方法能够在训练初期通过工具调用奖励积累工具使用技能，广泛接触环境反馈的不熟悉分布；在训练后期通过加强自模仿来利用重放经验中的成功模式，加速解决方案迭代而不产生无界熵增长。

Conclusion: SPEAR方法通过课程式自模仿学习有效平衡了探索与利用，解决了强化学习训练中的稳定性问题，为智能LLM代理的训练提供了更稳健的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Method: 提出基于轴承划分的数据分割策略，确保训练和测试集使用不同的物理轴承；将故障诊断重新定义为多标签分类问题；使用Macro AUROC等与流行度无关的评估指标。

Result: 研究发现传统的数据分割方法会引入虚假相关性，而基于轴承划分的方法能有效防止数据泄露；数据集多样性对模型泛化能力有决定性影响。

Conclusion: 数据泄露感知的评估协议对于工业故障诊断应用至关重要，本文提供了实用的数据集划分、模型选择和验证指南，有助于开发更可靠的机器学习系统。

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中为什么会失去可塑性，无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，基于Hessian的Kronecker分解近似，提出两种正则化增强方法：维持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化方法能有效保持网络的可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致神经网络失去可塑性的关键原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

TL;DR: 本文提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)方法，通过自蒸馏技术让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式，在SFT前作为预训练步骤，显著提升了模型准确性和校准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺场景下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 引入ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，旨在让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式并激励ICL式的内部推理，在SFT前作为预训练步骤执行。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准度。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口，表明ICL和SFT通过不同的功能机制实现适应。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Uncertainty方法，利用量子信息论中的冯·诺依曼熵来量化和分解大语言模型中的不确定性，将总不确定性分为固有的数据歧义（aleatoric）和模型限制（epistemic）两个独立成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多样化应用中的集成，获取可靠的预测不确定性度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据固有歧义的不确定性和仅来自模型限制的不确定性，以有效处理每种不确定性来源。

Method: 引入Spectral Uncertainty方法，利用量子信息论中的冯·诺依曼熵，为分离总不确定性提供严格理论基础，并整合细粒度的语义相似性表示，能够对模型响应中的各种语义解释进行细致区分。

Result: 经验评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计各种模型和基准数据集上的固有不确定性和总不确定性方面，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty提供了一种新颖且有效的方法来量化和分解大语言模型中的不确定性，在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 传统的MoE架构在NLP领域表现出色，但在时间序列分析中由于任务无关的路由器和缺乏通道相关性建模能力，难以适应多样化的时间序列任务。

Method: 提出了PatchMoE框架，包含：1）循环噪声门控机制利用分层信息进行任务感知路由；2）在时间和通道维度上操作的路由策略；3）精心设计的时空负载均衡损失函数。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的综合实验表明，PatchMoE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知的路由机制和时空相关性建模，成功地将MoE架构应用于时间序列分析，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Motivation: 现有语义通信系统主要关注信道自适应神经编码解码方案，缺乏对信号分布的充分探索，且采用自编码器架构导致编码与解码紧密耦合，存在实际扩展性问题。

Method: 在语义发射端使用神经编码器提取高层语义，在语义接收端使用条件扩散模型进行信号空间去噪，接收到的语义潜在变量作为条件输入引导解码过程。

Result: 理论证明所提出的解码器模型是真实数据的一致估计器，在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的仿真显示优于传统自编码器和变分自编码器的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器模型为无线语义通信提供了有效的解决方案，能够更好地探索信号分布并解决传统方法的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

Motivation: 生存数据常因失访等原因包含不完整的事件信息，这对合成数据生成提出了独特挑战，需要准确重现事件时间分布和删失机制。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制的损失函数联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游评估指标方面始终优于最先进的生成基线方法。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个明确设计用于生成合成生存数据的扩散模型，能够真实重现事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Motivation: 现有超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优，划分质量有待提升，特别是对于加权顶点集的处理效果不佳。

Method: 采用多目标非凸约束松弛模型，使用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；针对不同数据规模设计两种MST策略；引入贪婪迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，相比KaHyPar在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割集大小，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart等先进方法；细化策略可将hMetis划分结果提升16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现优异，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中的跨域泛化问题，现有单模态基础模型无法显式利用文本等模态中的领域知识，而端到端多模态模型不支持零样本推理。

Method: 通过标记化、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，使用模态引导的多头自注意力将其注入时间表示建模，在解码阶段采用原型引导的流匹配进行生成式概率预测。

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识，显著提升了时间序列预测的跨域泛化能力，支持零样本推理，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度为零的问题，同时利用RELU的稀疏性优势来减少推理计算量。

Method: 在前馈层中使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，预训练时使用随机激活，微调时固定为RELU用于推理。

Result: 相比从头训练RELU模型效果更好，推理时FLOPs减少且CPU速度显著提升；生成任务表现合理，略逊于最佳确定性非线性SILU。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，提供了控制文本生成多样性的新方法，在推理效率和生成质量间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器行动一致（容忍准确率），使用简单深筹码启发式方法在3万手牌中对Slumbot达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的胜率。

Conclusion: LLMs可能成为处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

*Anastasiia Filippova,Angelos Katharopoulos,David Grangier,Ronan Collobert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种内存和计算效率高的低通信分布式训练方法，通过限制反向传播只更新部分参数来减少峰值内存使用和训练FLOPs，同时保持全前向传播避免跨节点激活交换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法通过多次本地更新减少通信，但其效率仍有提升空间。需要更有效的方法来降低内存使用和计算开销。

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结。同时保持全前向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，在相同token和带宽预算下，该方法与现有低通信方法达到相同的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: 限制反向传播的参数更新范围是提高分布式训练效率的有效策略，能在保持模型性能的同时显著降低资源消耗。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative
memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural
architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting
where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as
selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed
online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents
through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes
sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed
protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性是神经常微分方程训练成功的关键，理论发现通过数值实验验证，为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法，结合边缘感知注意力机制和回溯线搜索全局化校正算子，显著提升物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流计算中的精度和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)作为AC潮流快速求解器，在精度方面仍需改进，特别是在推理阶段物理损失无法发挥作用，这阻碍了其在运营中的采用

Method: 1. 边缘感知注意力机制：通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性，捕捉电网各向异性；2. 回溯线搜索全局化校正算子：在推理阶段恢复有效的下降准则

Result: 在4-32总线电网测试中，电压测试RMSE为0.00033 p.u.，角度为0.08°，比PIGNN-MLP基线分别提升99.5%和87.1%；在4-1024总线电网上，批量推理速度比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS方法显著提升了物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流计算中的精度和效率，为电网运营提供了可靠的快速求解方案

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法依赖手工增强或复杂生成目标，且主要使用2D拓扑信息，未能充分利用有价值的3D结构信息。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-nets作为建模单元，通过预测子图嵌入与其互补邻域的关系来学习表示，结合2D图和3D构象，采用混合GNN-Transformer架构。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上超越对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法，达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D结构信息的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Conclusion: 基于这些见解，提出了通过比较离散Ricci流动力学来局部评估几何变换的新框架，并提出了实用的设计原则，包括几何启发的早停启发式和网络深度选择标准。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型音频语言模型(LALMs)中思维链(CoT)的忠实性问题，通过多种干预方法在SAKURA和MMAR数据集上进行实验，发现LALMs生成的CoT通常能够忠实反映其决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LALMs中思维链的忠实性，这对于安全敏感应用至关重要，因为音频推理需要先提取相关线索再进行推理，比文本模型更具挑战性。

Method: 应用多种针对性干预方法：转述、填充标记注入、早期回答和引入错误，在两个具有挑战性的推理数据集SAKURA和MMAR上进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，经过多种干预测试后，LALMs通常能够生成忠实于其底层决策过程的思维链。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs生成的思维链通常具有较高的忠实性，这对于安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

TL;DR: 提出一种联邦多模态钓鱼网站检测器，支持URL、HTML和图像输入，无需在推理时绑定客户端到固定模态。通过基于FedProx的角色感知桶聚合和硬门控专家选择，实现稳定训练和跨模态参数隔离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多模态检测的挑战，允许客户端灵活使用不同模态进行检测，同时保护隐私并提高系统可用性。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，采用硬门控选择模态专家（图像/HTML/URL），分离聚合模态特定参数以避免跨嵌入冲突。使用GraphCodeBERT处理URL，三路嵌入处理原始HTML。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；WebPhish（HTML）达到96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率；TR-OP（原始HTML）达到95.1%准确率和4.6%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家机制能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提升多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

TL;DR: 提出OFMU框架，通过双层优化和相似性感知惩罚机制解决机器学习遗忘中的梯度冲突问题，在保持模型效用的同时有效移除特定知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感应用中，需要能够移除特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息）而不重新训练模型，以满足法规合规、用户隐私和安全需求。现有方法使用加权求和将多目标问题简化为单目标问题，但会导致训练不稳定和模型效用下降。

Method: 提出OFMU惩罚式双层优化框架：内层最大化通过相似性感知惩罚解耦遗忘和保留目标的梯度，外层最小化恢复模型效用。开发了具有收敛保证的两循环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面均优于现有方法，实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: OFMU通过分层优化结构有效解决了机器学习遗忘中的梯度冲突问题，为大规模语言模型的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the
value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机方法可以获得更好的结果，在降低模型复杂度的同时保持性能表现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

TL;DR: 在持续学习中，激活函数的选择是缓解塑性损失的关键因素。作者提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（称为塑性损失）。现有研究对激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用探索不足。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性分析，提出了两种新的非线性激活函数：Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky，并在监督类增量基准和非平稳MuJoCo环境的强化学习中进行了评估。

Result: 实验表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在持续学习中维持模型的塑性，无需额外容量或任务特定调优。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计为持续学习提供了一种轻量级、领域通用的方法来维持塑性，是缓解塑性损失的主要架构无关手段。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型处理线性和非线性模式，评估了三种多步预测方法（递归、直接、多输入多输出）和多种ML模型。

Result: 基于12个数据集和21个模型的实验结果显示，多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对提高性能至关重要。

Conclusion: ARIMA-LSTM混合模型采用递归方法在大多数情况下优于其他模型，证明了混合系统在死亡率预测中的有效性。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出ReLAM框架，通过从无动作视频演示中自动生成密集结构化奖励来解决视觉强化学习中奖励设计瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界视觉环境中，由于感知限制，无法获得精确的位置信息来设计传统基于距离的奖励函数。

Method: 使用关键点提取空间距离信息，学习一个预测模型作为规划器，提出中间关键点子目标，在分层强化学习框架下训练目标条件策略。

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务上的实验表明，ReLAM显著加速学习并优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励，有效解决了视觉强化学习中奖励设计的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Davide Tenedini,Riccardo Zamboni,Mirco Mutti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督方法，将高维策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，通过生成模型重建行为，显著提高深度强化学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，主要原因是直接在冗余的高维参数空间中优化策略，这在多任务设置中问题更严重。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，使用行为重建损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性而非参数邻近性组织。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩高达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力。

Conclusion: 学习的流形支持在潜在空间中进行策略梯度优化，实现任务特定适应，显著提高样本效率。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个融合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新型框架，通过语义增强的位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决了地理坐标与语言标记之间的词汇不匹配问题，显著提升了人类移动轨迹生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动基础模型在数据规模和语义理解方面存在局限，而大型语言模型虽然具备强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解。需要结合两者的优势来生成更真实、语义丰富的移动轨迹。

Method: 1. 语义增强的位置编码：弥合地理坐标与语言之间的鸿沟
2. 渐进式课程学习：使LLM的推理与移动模式对齐
3. 交互式自反机制：用于条件轨迹生成

Result: MoveFM-R在广泛实验中显著优于现有的MFM和LLM基线方法，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFM的统计能力与LLM的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个新的范式，实现了更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格子玻尔兹曼方程虽然能捕捉复杂流动行为，但数值求解计算量大，受碰撞核的严格时间步长限制。

Method: 引入物理信息神经算子框架，结合LBE的固有矩匹配约束和全局等变性，实现离散化无关和碰撞模型无关的建模。

Result: 在复杂流动场景中表现出鲁棒性，包括冯卡门涡街、韧带断裂和气泡粘附等，支持从粗网格到细网格的泛化。

Conclusion: 为动力学系统建模开辟了新的数据驱动途径，能够有效处理不同动力学数据集，不受特定碰撞模型限制。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线，解决了RLVR训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现了稳定的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值基线的无价值RL方法（如GRPO和DAPO）在面对奖励异常值时，会不当地惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，通过一阶softmax更新实现双向熵安全。

Result: QAE稳定了熵变化，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上持续提升AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023的pass@1性能。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式方法）是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE为强化学习训练提供了稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法能有效整合各种预训练模型，在域内和跨域场景中均取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: 图提示学习应专注于释放预训练模型的能力，而分类器应适应下游场景，UniPrompt方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: 首次正式证明了训练后的DFM模型生成的分布会随着训练集规模的增加而收敛到真实数据分布。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

TL;DR: 该研究解决了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过加权预测向量来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重超过时间延迟时能实现常数遗憾和最佳迭代收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略会导致优化不一致，虽然OFTRL算法通过预测未来奖励来解决这个问题，但过去奖励的观察时间延迟会阻碍预测效果。

Method: 提出加权OFTRL算法，其中下一个奖励的预测向量被加权n次，利用乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略收敛到纳什均衡子序列。

Conclusion: WOFTRL算法能有效解决博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，理论结果得到实验验证和支持。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Method: 将启发式学习建模为约束优化问题，引入CEA损失函数在训练中强制可容许性；利用PDB抽象和图结构特性分析样本复杂度；使用ReLU神经网络提供泛化保证。

Result: 在魔方问题上获得了接近可容许的启发式函数，比压缩PDB启发式提供更强的引导；理论分析给出了A*算法泛化所需的训练样本数量界限。

Conclusion: CEA方法能够学习接近可容许的高质量启发式函数，理论分析为启发式学习提供了泛化保证，特别是针对目标依赖启发式函数。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

TL;DR: 提出了Flood复形来解决大规模点云数据的持久同调计算问题，相比传统的Vietoris-Rips复形具有更好的可扩展性，支持GPU并行化，能在数百万点的3D点云上计算二维持久同调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vietoris-Rips复形在计算大规模欧几里得点云数据的持久同调时面临指数级增长的复杂度问题，现有替代方法如Alpha复形或稀疏Rips近似仍会产生过多的单纯形，限制了在大规模点云上的应用。

Method: 引入Flood复形，受Alpha复形和Witness复形启发。在给定过滤值r下，包含点云小子集Delaunay三角剖分中所有被半径为r的球完全覆盖的单纯形，称为"淹没"过程。该方法支持高效PH计算和GPU并行化。

Result: 在3D点云数据上的扩展实验表明，该方法能在数百万点上计算二维持久同调。在真实世界和合成数据的物体分类任务中，对于几何或拓扑复杂的物体，性能优于其他基于PH的方法和点云神经网络。

Conclusion: Flood复形为解决大规模点云持久同调计算提供了可扩展的解决方案，在处理复杂几何和拓扑结构时表现出优越性能，证明了这种扩展能力在处理复杂物体时的必要性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM)蒸馏框架，用于加速静电生成模型PFGM++的采样过程，通过将蒸馏问题转化为逆问题来学习生成器，显著减少了采样所需的函数评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFGM++等静电生成模型虽然性能优异，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟进行采样，计算成本高昂。需要开发高效的蒸馏方法来加速采样过程。

Method: 将蒸馏问题重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配。推导了可处理的训练目标，当D→∞时，IPFM能恢复Score Identity Distillation (SiD)方法。

Result: IPFM生成的蒸馏生成器仅需少量函数评估就能达到接近甚至优于教师模型的样本质量。有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度比D→∞（扩散模型）时更快。

Conclusion: IPFM为静电生成模型提供了有效的蒸馏框架，显著加速采样过程，且有限D值的PFGM++模型具有更优的优化和采样特性。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Motivation: 传统的全空间优化方法需要将神经网络的中间变量和约束暴露给求解器，导致计算效率低下。本文旨在通过减少优化问题的维度来提高求解效率。

Method: 采用缩减空间公式化方法，将神经网络视为"灰盒"，仅暴露输入输出关系给优化求解器，而不暴露中间变量和约束。

Result: 与全空间公式化相比，该方法在内点法中实现了更快的求解速度和更少的迭代次数。在两个优化问题上验证了有效性：MNIST图像分类器的对抗生成和电力系统安全约束最优潮流问题。

Conclusion: 缩减空间公式化方法能够显著提高基于神经网络的优化问题的求解效率，特别是在GPU加速环境下表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

Method: 建立对偶乐观上升与增广拉格朗日方法梯度下降上升之间的等价关系，将ALM的理论保证转移到对偶乐观方法。

Result: 证明对偶乐观方法等价于增广拉格朗日方法的梯度下降上升，从而获得线性收敛到所有局部解的保证。

Conclusion: 填补了对偶乐观方法实证成功与理论基础之间的关键空白，为超参数调优提供原则性指导。

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

*Zahid Iqbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对联邦学习中的统计异构性、模型异构性和激励机制三大挑战，提出了DL-SH、DL-MH和I-DL-MH三种方法，显著提升了模型精度并降低了通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临三个主要挑战：1）客户端因业务需求和计算资源差异无法训练相同模型；2）统计异构性（非IID数据）导致全局模型性能下降；3）需要激励机制鼓励客户端参与训练。

Method: 提出三种方法：DL-SH处理统计异构性，实现高效、隐私保护和通信高效的联邦学习；DL-MH管理完全异构模型并处理统计差异；I-DL-MH是基于DL-MH的激励机制扩展，通过提供激励促进客户端参与。

Conclusion: 提出的DL-SH、DL-MH和I-DL-MH方法有效解决了联邦学习中的统计异构性和模型异构性问题，同时通过激励机制提高了客户端参与度，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型通常将连续数据和离散事件视为独立过程，这限制了在复杂系统中建模它们同步交互的能力。

Method: 提出JointDiff扩散框架，引入CrossGuid条件操作支持多智能体领域的可控生成，包括弱控球者引导和文本引导两种新场景。

Result: 在增强的体育基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了联合建模对于构建真实可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 联合建模连续和离散过程对于构建现实且可控的交互系统生成模型具有关键意义。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏相应容量的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。

Method: ECHO将EEG建模重构为序列到序列学习，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本来构建上下文线索，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，显示出卓越的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心化设计和序列到序列学习范式，为EEG建模提供了更有效的多任务适应解决方案，展示了在异构任务上的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Motivation: 捆绑定价是收益管理中的经典问题，但由于候选捆绑组合数量呈指数级增长，该问题通常难以求解。

Method: 开发混合捆绑模型的图表示，训练GCN学习最优捆绑的潜在模式，提出两种推断策略获得可行解，并使用局部搜索技术提高解质量。

Result: 在5产品实例上训练的GCN，对于中小规模问题能以极少计算时间获得接近最优解(优于97%)，对于更大规模问题优于其他启发式方法如BSP，在30+产品且产品效用非可加的情况下仍能提供高质量解。

Conclusion: GCN框架在捆绑定价问题中表现出高效性和有效性，能够处理大规模和复杂情况。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

Motivation: 捷克东北部是地震活跃区，既有构造地震也有采矿诱发地震，需要快速区分这两类事件以进行有效监测和预警。

Method: 应用机器学习方法（包括长短期记忆循环神经网络和XGBoost）对Seismic Polygon Frenštát数据集进行二元分类。

Result: LSTM和XGBoost在二元分类任务中取得了0.94-0.95的F1分数，表明现代机器学习技术在地震事件快速分类方面具有良好潜力。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效区分构造地震和采矿诱发地震，为地震监测提供了快速准确的事件分类工具。

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地估计类增量学习的性能分布，解决传统方法低估真实方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIL评估协议仅从少量随机序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致有偏估计和严重低估真实方差。

Method: 提出EDGE协议，基于任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关关系，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列来逼近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，更准确地估计分布边界，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的CIL性能分布估计，改进了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EDGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成模型虽然在各领域取得优异成果，但推理速度慢，需要多步采样。Mean Flow虽然能实现单步生成，但在许多连续域中无法准确近似原始多步流匹配过程的行为。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，开发能够更好保持原始多步流过程保真度和多样性的单步生成器。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输采样策略，提出的方法成功解决了Mean Flow在连续域中的局限性，实现了既快速又高质量的单步生成。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架为公平高效的点对点保险和基于网络的风险池提供了设计原则，结合了数学严谨性和经济可解释性。

Abstract: Over the past decade alternatives to traditional insurance and banking have
grown in popularity. The desire to encourage local participation has lead
products such as peer-to-peer insurance, reciprocal contracts, and
decentralized finance platforms to increasingly rely on network structures to
redistribute risk among participants. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive
framework for linear risk sharing (LRS), where random losses are reallocated
through nonnegative linear operators which can accommodate a wide range of
networks. Building on the theory of stochastic and doubly stochastic matrices,
we establish conditions under which constraints such as budget balance,
fairness, and diversification are guaranteed. The convex order framework allows
us to compare different allocations rigorously, highlighting variance reduction
and majorization as natural consequences of doubly stochastic mixing. We then
extend the analysis to network-based sharing, showing how their topology shapes
risk outcomes in complete, star, ring, random, and scale-free graphs. A second
layer of randomness, where the sharing matrix itself is random, is introduced
via Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi and preferential-attachment networks, connecting
risk-sharing properties to degree distributions. Finally, we study convex
combinations of identity and network-induced operators, capturing the trade-off
between self-retention and diversification. Our results provide design
principles for fair and efficient peer-to-peer insurance and network-based risk
pooling, combining mathematical soundness with economic interpretability.

Motivation: 研究在卖家拥有私人成本信息的情况下，如何设计可信的拍卖机制来实现最优收益，探讨静态机制的限制和动态机制的优势。

Method: 分析不同拍卖机制的可信性，包括第一价格拍卖、英式拍卖和荷兰式拍卖，研究对称机制中只有获胜者支付时的可信静态拍卖特征。

Result: 最优第一价格拍卖不可信，英式拍卖可以可信地实施最优机制，荷兰式拍卖不行。可信的静态拍卖必须是第一价格拍卖，通过秘密保留价和投标限制来运作。

Conclusion: 卖家私人成本信息使得静态机制无法实现最优收益，这凸显了公共机构的作用，并解释了非正式拍卖中动态机制的使用。

Abstract: A seller wants to sell a good to a set of bidders using a credible mechanism.
We show that when the seller has private information about her cost, it is
impossible for a static mechanism to achieve the optimal revenue. In
particular, even the optimal first-price auction is not credible. We show that
the English auction can credibly implement the optimal mechanism, unlike the
optimal Dutch auction. For symmetric mechanisms in which only winners pay, we
also characterize all the static auctions that are credible: They are
first-price auctions that depend only on the seller's cost ex post via a secret
reserve, and may profitably pool bidders via a bid restriction. Our
impossibility result highlights the role of public institutions and helps
explain the use of dynamic mechanisms in informal auctions.

Motivation: 研究多中心分配问题中的公平性，特别是在国际医疗合作和工人交换项目等实际应用中，需要尊重不同中心的优先级同时保证分配的公平性。

Method: 引入三种公平概念：内部公平（消除同一中心内代理人的嫉妒）、外部公平（消除不同中心间代理人的嫉妒）、程序公平（从先验角度通过交易机会消除嫉妒）。通过策略证明性和效率等条件，对TTC机制进行特征化分析。

Result: 证明了三个主要定理：定理1显示策略证明性和配对效率下，内部公平和外部公平共同特征化TTC；定理2显示策略证明性单独与程序公平也特征化TTC；定理3通过添加内部公平，在放松队列理性的条件下特征化TTC。

Conclusion: 该研究为多中心分配问题提供了系统的公平性分析框架，并通过TTC机制的特征化结果，为市场设计者在实际应用中提供了理论指导和实用工具。

Abstract: We investigate Ekici (2024b)'s multi-center allocation problems, focusing on
fairness in this context. We introduce three fairness notions that respect
centers' priorities: internal fairness, external fairness, and procedural
fairness. The first notion eliminates envy among agents within the same center,
the second prohibits envy across different centers, and the third rules out
envy from an ex-ante perspective through agents' trading opportunities. We
provide two characterizations of a natural extension of the top-trading-cycles
mechanism (TTC) through our fairness notions. Precisely, we show that in the
presence of strategy-proofness and pair efficiency, internal fairness and
external fairness together characterize TTC (Theorem 1). Also,
strategy-proofness combined solely with procedural fairness also characterizes
TTC (Theorem 2). Furthermore, by adding internal fairness, we establish our
third TTC characterization, by relaxing Ekici's queuewise rationality to
another voluntary participation condition, the center lower bound (Theorem 3).
Finally, we define a core solution within this model and characterize it
through TTC (Theorem 4). Our findings offer practical insights for market
designers, particularly in contexts such as international cooperation in
medical programs and worker exchange programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球电子电气产品贸易中，电子垃圾常被错误分类以规避监管，传统分析方法难以在海量数据中识别这种非法贸易模式。

Method: 采用离群感知分割方法（迭代K-Means），先隔离极端离群值防止数据偏斜，再重新聚类揭示市场细分；开发逻辑回归模型计算废物评分，识别与废料贸易模式统计相似的产品。

Result: 在马来西亚和全球数据集中发现一致的四层市场层级结构；马来西亚市场以高容量大宗商品为主，全球市场以高价值资本货物为主；成功识别出如发电机等以废料方式交易的成品商品。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效识别伪装成正常商品的电子废弃物，为监管机构提供针对性监管清单，揭示了不同市场的独特专业化特征。

Abstract: The global trade in electronic and electrical goods is complicated by the
challenge of identifying e-waste, which is often misclassified to evade
regulations. Traditional analysis methods struggle to discern the underlying
patterns of this illicit trade within vast datasets. This research proposes and
validates a robust, data-driven framework to segment products and identify
goods exhibiting an anomalous "waste signature" a trade pattern defined by a
clear 'inverse price-volume'. The core of the framework is an Outlier-Aware
Segmentation method, an iterative K-Means approach that first isolates extreme
outliers to prevent data skewing and then re-clusters the remaining products to
reveal subtle market segments. To quantify risk, a "Waste Score" is developed
using a Logistic Regression model that identifies products whose trade
signatures are statistically similar to scrap. The findings reveal a consistent
four-tier market hierarchy in both Malaysian and global datasets. A key pattern
emerged from a comparative analysis: Malaysia's market structure is defined by
high-volume bulk commodities, whereas the global market is shaped by high-value
capital goods, indicating a unique national specialization. The framework
successfully flags finished goods, such as electric generators (HS 8502), that
are traded like scrap, providing a targeted list for regulatory scrutiny.

Motivation: 研究维谢格拉德四国（捷克、匈牙利、波兰、斯洛伐克）财政政策支出冲击的经济影响，了解这些国家财政乘数的特殊性。

Method: 使用结构向量自回归（SVAR）模型，基于1999年第一季度至2019年第四季度的84个季度观测数据进行估计。

Result: 财政扩张在维谢格拉德四国（除斯洛伐克外）具有较大影响：捷克长期支出乘数0.81，匈牙利1.14，波兰1.76；斯洛伐克乘数为-0.18但不显著。

Conclusion: 较高的支出乘数与较高的增值税收入占比、较高的债务比率、较高的外债以及较低的开放度相关。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of a fiscal policy spending shock on the
economy of the Visegrad 4 countries. The impact is estimated with an SVAR
model, and the calculations are based on 84 quarterly observations
(1999Q1-2019Q4). The results suggest that fiscal expansion has a larger than
usual impact in the V4 countries (except for Slovakia): the estimated long-term
(5-year) cumulative spending multipliers are 0.81 for Czechia, 1.14 for
Hungary, and 1.76 for Poland (the Slovakian multiplier has a value of -0.18,
but it is not significant). The discussion section also connects higher
spending multipliers with a higher share of VAT revenues, a higher debt ratio,
higher foreign debt, and lower openness.

Method: 使用2018年GUESSS数据库中的9667份匈牙利学生数据，构建广义线性模型分析学生创业意图、态度、自我效能、社会规范等变量对创业生态系统感知的影响。

Result: 学生的创业意图、创业态度、自我效能感、社会规范以及大学和专业领域都对学生在大学内感知创业生态系统有微小但统计显著的影响。

Conclusion: 应更注重塑造学生态度和激发兴趣，以提高创业教育的效率。

Abstract: Modern universities may play a significant role in entrepreneurial ecosystems
by boosting the entrepreneurial activity of the region. One way to achieve this
is through entrepreneurship education. In this study we suggest that one reason
why entrepreneurship education has a weak impact on entrepreneurial activity is
that the effect of courses and extracurricular programmes depends on how
students perceive the entrepreneurial activity. We use the 2018 GUESSS
database, which includes 9,667 answers for Hungary, to develop a general linear
model. The model suggests that students' entrepreneurial intentions, attitudes
toward entrepreneurship, self-efficacy, social norms, as well as the
university, and the field of study all have a small but statistically
significant impact on how students perceive the entrepreneurial ecosystem
within the university. Our conclusion is that more emphasis on shaping
attitudes and arousing student interest can increase the efficiency of

*Hannes Wallimann,Anna Mehr*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 2025年欧洲女子足球锦标赛对瑞士旅游业的实际影响有限，仅主要场馆城市出现1.6%的住宿增长，总体旅游效应温和但积极。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补女性体育赛事影响评估的研究空白，对欧洲最大女子体育赛事——2025年欧洲女子足球锦标赛进行及时评估。

Method: 使用城市级酒店过夜数据，采用Arkhangelsky等人(2021)的合成双重差分法，比较主办城市与非主办目的地。

Result: 结果显示旅游影响不大，仅主要场馆城市有1.6%的住宿增长，置信区间仅支持对主要场馆的明确结论。

Conclusion: 欧洲女子足球锦标赛的旅游影响积极但温和，为体育赛事政策评估提供了进一步框架。

Abstract: The impact evaluation of female sports events remains an important yet
neglected area of research. To fill this gap, this working paper provides a
timely assessment of the 2025 UEFA Women's European Championship (WEURO) in
Switzerland-the largest women-specific sports event in Europe with more than
657,000 spectators. Using city-level data on hotel overnight stays, we apply
the Synthetic Difference-in-Differences approach of Arkhangelsky et al. (2021)
to compare WEURO host cities with non-host destinations. In summary, our
results do not support strong claims of large tourism impacts but rather point
to a small positive effect. Sensitivity analyses also suggest positive effects.
However, confidence intervals permit firm conclusions only for the main venues,
indicating an increase in overnight stays of 1.6% attributable to the WEURO.
Overall, our findings indicate positive but modest tourism impacts of the WEURO
and outline a framework for further policy evaluation of sports events.

*Emanuel Kohlscheen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 使用随机森林模型分析13个发达国家35年房价驱动因素，发现价格动量、初始估值和家庭信贷增长是主要因素，模型预测精度比OLS模型显著提升44-45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别过去35年发达国家房价的主要驱动因素，探索房价增长背后的关键变量。

Method: 基于Breiman(2001)的随机森林模型，使用Shapley值分析变量重要性，比较了10个预定解释变量的效果。

Result: 房价增长主要由价格动量、价格租金比和家庭信贷增长驱动，发现CPI通胀对房价的非线性影响，随机森林模型比OLS模型RMSE降低44%，MAE降低45%。

Conclusion: 随机森林模型能有效预测房价变化，且适用于所有国家，因为国别固定效应影响很小。

Abstract: This article identifies the factors that drove house prices in 13 advanced
countries over the past 35 years. It does so based on Breiman s (2001) random
forest model. Shapley values indicate that annual house price growth across
countries is explained first and foremost by price momentum, initial valuations
(proxied by price to rent ratios) and household credit growth. Partial effects
of explanatory variables are also elicited and suggest important
non-linearities, for instance as to what concerns the effects of CPI inflation
on house price growth. The out-of-sample forecast test reveals that the random
forest model delivers 44% lower house price variation RMSEs and 45% lower MAEs
when compared to an OLS model that uses the same set of 10 pre-determined
explanatory variables. Notably, the same model works well for all countries, as
the random forest attributes minimal values to country fixed effects.

### [349] [Persistent Gaps, Partial Gains: A Population-Level Study of COVID-19 Learning Inequalities in the Netherlands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22136)
*Hekmat Alrouh,Tom Emery,Anja Schreijer*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 使用荷兰人口数据研究发现，疫情期间学校关闭加剧了教育不平等，特别是父母教育程度和移民背景的学生在职业教育轨道中受影响最大，而农村学生反而缩小了差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行扰乱了全球学校教育，引发了人们对教育不平等加剧的担忧，需要研究社会经济差异在疫情前后的演变。

Method: 使用荷兰人口级行政数据（N=1,471,217），分析2017-2023年毕业队列的最终中央考试成绩，通过广义线性模型估计疫情暴露与关键分层变量（父母教育、家庭收入、移民背景、城市化程度）的交互作用。

Result: 虽然平均成绩到2023年部分恢复，但父母教育程度和移民背景造成的不平等持续存在或加剧，特别是在职业教育轨道中。非西方背景的第一代学生损失最大，而农村学生（先前处于劣势）缩小或逆转了疫情前的成绩差距。

Conclusion: 系统性冲击既能加剧也能重新调整不平等模式，具体取决于社会人口维度和教育背景。教育路径和当地环境在塑造对危机引起的学习中断的韧性方面发挥重要作用。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted schooling worldwide, raising concerns about
widening educational inequalities. Using population-level administrative data
from the Netherlands (N = 1,471,217), this study examines how socio-economic
disparities in secondary school performance evolved before, during, and after
pandemic-related school closures. We analyze final central examination scores
for cohorts graduating between 2017 and 2023 across four educational tracks,
estimating generalized linear models with interactions between pandemic
exposure and key stratification variables: parental education, household
income, migration background, and urbanicity. Results show that while average
performance partially recovered by 2023, inequalities by parental education and
migration background persisted or intensified, particularly in vocational
tracks. First-generation students with a non-Western background experienced the
largest sustained losses, whereas students in rural areas (previously
disadvantaged) narrowed or reversed pre-pandemic performance gaps. Findings
suggest that systemic shocks can both exacerbate and recalibrate inequality
patterns, depending on the socio-demographic dimension and educational context.
We discuss implications for stratification theory, highlighting the role of
educational pathways and local contexts in shaping resilience to crisis-induced
learning disruptions.

### [350] [How firms, bureaucrats, and ministries benefit from the revolving door: Evidence from Japan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22173)
*Trevor Incerti*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 日本官僚离职后就业市场呈现两极分化：高层官员进入企业带来政府贷款和股市收益，低层官员进入非营利组织获得更高价值合同，揭示了旋转门现象既是企业需求驱动也是官僚激励的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注立法关联企业的回报，较少关注官僚关联和非营利组织的回报，需要揭示官僚离职后的就业模式和影响。

Method: 使用日本所有前公务员首次离职后职位数据，分析不同级别官员的就业选择和产生的经济回报。

Result: 精英经济部门高层官员更可能加入企业，带来政府贷款增加和股市正面反应；低层官员更可能加入政府关联非营利组织，在领导职位时获得更高价值合同。

Conclusion: 旋转门动态是企业需求驱动和官僚激励共同作用的结果，政府部门通过引导利益来确保公务员的长期职业价值。

Abstract: A growing literature finds high returns to firms with legislative
connections. Less attention has been paid to returns from bureaucratic
connections and to organizations beyond for-profit firms. Using data recording
the first post-bureaucracy position occupied by all former civil servants in
Japan, I reveal a bifurcated job market for former bureaucrats. High-ranking
officials from elite economic ministries are more likely to join for-profit
firms, where they generate returns such as increased government loans and
positive stock market reactions. Lower-ranking officials are more likely to
join nonprofits linked to government ministries, which receive higher-value
contracts when former bureaucrats are in leadership roles. These patterns
suggest that while firms wish to hire bureaucrats who can deliver tangible
benefits, ministries also shape revolving door pathways by directing benefits
to ensure long-term career value for civil servants. These findings reframe
revolving door dynamics as the result of both firm-driven demand and
bureaucratic incentives.

### [351] [Metro 3 in Brussels under uncertainty: scenario-based public transport accessibility analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22223)
*Brecht Verbeken,Arne Vanhoyweghen,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文对布鲁塞尔地铁3号线进行了基于场景的可达性评估，发现该项目能显著改善可达性，特别是在低收入社区，具有减少社会空间不平等的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布鲁塞尔地铁3号线是欧洲最具争议的基础设施项目之一，成本不断上升、工期延误且完工时间不确定，但缺乏公开的可达性评估来为政策辩论提供依据。

Method: 使用基于时刻表的公共交通数据，结合所有区域运营商的官方GTFS数据，构建三个场景：当前网络、部分实施（南部预地铁段改造）和完全实施到Bordet。在布鲁塞尔首都大区的647个均匀分布的500米点上测量公共交通出行时间。

Result: 结果显示可达性显著但不均衡地提升，最大改善发生在收入低于平均水平的社区。时间稳健性分析显示可达性结果存在变异性，突显了考虑出发时间不确定性的必要性。

Conclusion: 地铁3号线具有减少可达性方面社会空间不平等的潜力，为这个公共辩论主要关注成本的项目提供了透明证据。

Abstract: Metro Line 3 in Brussels is one of Europe's most debated infrastructure
projects, marked by escalating costs, delays, and uncertainty over completion.
Yet no public accessibility appraisal exists to inform this policy debate. This
paper provides a scenario-based assessment of the spatial and distributional
accessibility impacts of Metro 3 using schedule-based public transport data.
Official GTFS feeds from all regional operators were combined and adapted to
represent three scenarios: (i) the current network, (ii) partial implementation
of Metro 3 (conversion of the southern premetro section), and (iii) full
implementation to Bordet. Accessibility was measured as public transport travel
time between 647 evenly spaced 500 m points covering the Brussels-Capital
Region. Simulations were conducted for morning, evening, and weekend midday
periods, each with three departure times (t-10, t, t+10), capturing robustness
to short-term timetable variation. Results show substantial but uneven
accessibility gains, with the largest improvements occurring in neighborhoods
with below-average incomes. Temporal robustness analysis highlights variability
in accessibility outcomes, underscoring the need to account for uncertainty in
departure timing. These findings suggest that Metro 3 has the potential to
reduce socio-spatial inequalities in accessibility, providing transparent
evidence for a project where public debate is dominated by cost concerns.

### [352] [Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Propensity Scores and Average Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22122)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出通过直接最小化偏倚校正项h₀的预测误差来估计倾向得分，从而提高平均处理效应(ATE)估计的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如最大似然或协变量平衡可能无法最优地估计偏倚校正项h₀或ATE，因此需要更直接的方法

Method: 从Bregman散度最小化的角度提出直接偏倚校正项估计框架，通过最小化h₀的预测误差来估计倾向得分

Result: 通过模拟研究评估所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: 直接估计偏倚校正项的方法有望提高ATE估计的准确性

Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE).
For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct
bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the
observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates,
$D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i
\in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term
$h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$
plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the
probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose
estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly
minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$
is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve
estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ
maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these
approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We
present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation
approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct
simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
