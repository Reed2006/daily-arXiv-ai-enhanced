### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过上下文概念学习实验发现，语言模型在量词理解上存在向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型中存在的隐含偏见，特别是通过概念学习任务来发现模型的内在偏好。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验，比较直接提示和概念学习组件下的模型表现差异。

Result: 语言模型在量词理解上表现出向上单调性偏见，这种偏见在概念学习任务中更明显。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型隐藏偏见的有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出从静态数据收集转向交互式语言发现的范式转变，通过人机协作动态学习低资源语言


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言面临文本语料库缺乏、标准化拼写困难和标注流程难以扩展的问题，现有大语言模型依赖大量预收集数据和集中式基础设施，难以惠及代表性不足的社区

Method: 基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合模型的认知不确定性与人类说话者的犹豫线索和置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留

Result: 这是一个立场论文，提出了理论框架而非具体实验结果

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考AI如何与人类知识互动，从提取式数据收集转向参与式、共适应的学习过程，尊重并赋能社区，同时发现和保护世界语言多样性

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LLM分析828家美国上市公司气候披露，发现风险叙事与承诺相关但量化目标与语气脱节，大公司和高排放公司披露更多但不一致，披露风格趋同影响决策有用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿性和象征性报告往往削弱其价值

Method: 开发多维框架，使用针对气候沟通微调的大型语言模型，通过四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性、目标雄心）从可持续性和年度报告中提取叙事指标

Result: 风险聚焦叙事与明确承诺一致但量化目标与语气脱节；大公司和高排放公司披露更多承诺和行动但与量化目标不一致；披露风格广泛相似表明模仿行为

Conclusion: LLM在ESG叙事分析中具有价值，需要更强监管将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在兽医肿瘤记录上的表现，发现Product 1在事实准确性、完整性和组织性等方面表现最佳，并验证了LLM作为评判者的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床环境中应用日益广泛，但在兽医医学领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过基于评分标准的LLM作为评判者框架，对三种商业兽医LLM总结工具在五个领域进行评分。

Result: Product 1表现最佳，中位数平均得分4.61，在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得完美中位数得分。LLM评分者表现出高可重复性。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性得到证实，LLM作为评判者的评估方法是兽医医学中临床NLP总结评估的可扩展且可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化设计实现高效的事实核查，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，优于使用更大模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算成本高且不透明。ClaimCheck旨在开发一个使用小语言模型和实时网络证据的透明、高效事实核查系统。

Method: 采用模块化验证流程：网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索、声明裁决评估。每个模块都针对小语言模型进行优化。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，优于使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过仔细的模块化设计和提示策略，小语言模型能够克服其局限性，实现高效且可解释的事实核查，同时显著降低计算需求。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前数学基准测试对LLM推理能力的评估准确性，并提出了EEFSUVA新基准，发现即使最先进的LLM在该基准上表现也显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学基准主要基于IMO等知名竞赛，可能存在数据污染问题，且问题类型单一，无法全面评估LLM的真实数学推理能力。

Method: 从东欧和前苏联国家的区域性奥林匹克竞赛中收集问题，构建EEFSUVA基准，这些问题难度与IMO相当但需要非标准解题技巧，且在在线语料库中较少出现。

Result: 初步结果显示，即使最先进的LLM在EEFSUVA基准上的表现也显著低于其他奥林匹克风格基准。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并指导未来模型开发。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在系统提示与用户输入冲突时往往忽视层级指令规则，而更倾向于服从社会线索如权威或共识。机制分析显示模型能早期检测冲突信号，但对社会线索有更一致的解决机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型应该遵循层级指令（系统提示优先于用户输入），但现有研究表明模型经常忽视这一规则，反而更强烈地服从社会线索如权威或共识。需要深入理解这一行为的机制原因。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测机制，并进行向量引导实验来测试模型行为。

Result: 系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间；模型在系统-用户冲突中检测更强但解决不一致，对社会线索有更一致的解决机制；引导向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 这些结果解释了系统服从的脆弱性，并强调需要开发轻量级的层级敏感对齐方法来解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需人工标注的文档重排方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后用对比学习微调小型transformer模型，在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排中表现出色但计算成本高，而微调小型模型需要稀缺的人工标注数据，需要找到平衡效率和性能的解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM从领域语料生成合成查询，用LLM分类器标注正负样本对，然后用LCE损失的对比学习微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上显著提升领域内性能，并在领域外任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排能力，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统研究汉字嵌入的几何模式，发现内容词呈现聚类模式，功能词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究汉字嵌入的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，交叉验证7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布，进行123个短语的子网络分析。

Result: 内容词呈现聚类模式，功能词呈现分支模式；有意义的字符展现丰富的几何多样性，结构部首聚集成紧密簇；从基本字符到短语存在系统的语义扩展模式。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供了计算证据，建立了语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型框架，用于提高高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信息过载和高风险决策需求下自动摘要的可靠性问题，避免过度自信的预测。

Method: 构建条件生成式摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵衡量不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并加入风险评分和调节模块。

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling框架，通过分解基准测试性能为10种认知能力，揭示基准测试实际测量的能力组合，解释为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为它们掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合。缺乏系统方法来验证基准测试是否真正测量其声称的能力标签。

Method: 结合基于梯度的重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)来量化每种能力对模型在特定基准测试中成功的贡献程度。

Result: 分析三个指令调优模型在十个广泛使用的基准测试上发现：大多数基准测试依赖多种能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准测试奖励广泛的多技能改进；与任务无关的能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个提示感知的路由框架，通过提取任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标等多维度特征，使用神经排序模型为每个提示选择最合适的LLM，在性能和效率间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在能力、延迟和计算成本方面的多样化发展，如何为每个提示选择最合适的模型来优化性能与效率的权衡成为关键部署挑战。

Method: 利用从提示中提取的丰富、可读特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索等），结合轻量级代理求解器的信号，通过神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用。

Result: 在包含36,497个提示、11个基准测试和11个最先进LLM的RouterBench上，LLMRank达到了89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。

Conclusion: 多维度特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性得到验证，特征驱动的路由为高效透明的LLM部署展示了潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

### [14] [GRPO++: Enhancing Dermatological Reasoning under Low Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01236)
*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种通过多阶段资源高效方法开发的视觉语言模型，旨在模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。主要贡献是改进的GRPO++算法，稳定了数据密集的GRPO框架，并结合DPO进行事实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在皮肤病学等复杂领域中结构化推理能力受限的问题，主要挑战包括数据稀缺和高级训练技术的高计算成本。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用GRPO++进行推理导向的疾病识别，然后进行监督微调以提升对话能力，最后使用基于知识图谱的DPO进行事实对齐。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠视觉语言模型的可行途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [15] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，将查询重定向到四种路径，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有后生成修正方法计算成本高且无法预防不可靠内容的生成

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计，生成统一置信度分数来决定路由路径

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著提升（0.74 vs 0.42基线），计算成本降低40%，F1分数从0.61提升到0.82，假阳性率低至0.09

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算效率高的方法

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记在LLMs中并非无害，即使少量填充也会影响激活、生成质量、偏见和安全防护，构成部署风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在LLMs批量推理中广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致其影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 在三个开源模型家族（Llama、Gemma、Qwen）中系统研究，插入受控数量的填充标记，并沿四个维度评估：激活、生成质量、偏见和安全性。

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的生成质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须仔细处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一个用于在单设备大型语言模型中高效处理多轮交互中子任务的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入任务特定指令来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单一模型需要处理多样化的子任务来更有效地支持用户请求。传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生显著计算开销。

Method: 通过重用主任务的KV缓存，在隔离的侧路径中注入任务特定指令。子任务执行后，通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余预填充计算。还开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略来支持子任务选择。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展且高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的上下文指令流和KV缓存重用机制，有效解决了多任务对话中的计算效率问题，为设备端LLM应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: SKYLENAGE提供了两个互补的数学基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（100项结构化诊断集）和SKYLENAGE-MATH（150项竞赛风格套件），用于评估LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在天花板效应，需要更困难、覆盖更广且具有丰富元数据的数学推理基准来评估LLM的数学能力。

Method: 创建了两个基准：1）100项结构化诊断集，包含长度、数值密度和符号复杂度元数据；2）150项竞赛风格套件，涵盖高中到博士四个阶段和七个学科分类。评估了15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛套件中，最强模型达到44%准确率，次优为37%；准确率从高中到博士阶段下降，顶级系统的博士到高中保留率约为79%。在推理集中，最佳模型总体达到81%，最难部分结果显示了领先模型与中游模型之间的明显稳健性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个困难、以推理为中心、广泛覆盖的数学基准，具有校准的难度和丰富的元数据，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

### [20] [Detoxifying Large Language Models via Autoregressive Reward Guided Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01243)
*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARGRE框架，通过建模毒性转换轨迹和构建自回归奖励模型，实现精确高效的LLM去毒化，在保持模型核心能力的同时显著降低毒性和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法存在干预不精确的问题，主要原因是未能充分探索毒性和非毒性输出之间的转换空间。

Method: ARGRE框架：识别非毒性语义方向，在毒性和非毒性表示之间插值以揭示细粒度转换轨迹；构建自回归奖励模型提供稳定编辑指导；在推理时采用自适应两步编辑过程（方向性转向和梯度优化）。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上实验表明，ARGRE显著优于领先基线方法：毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，同时保持原始模型核心能力。

Conclusion: ARGRE通过精确建模毒性转换轨迹和自适应编辑过程，实现了高效且有效的LLM去毒化，为安全部署提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，并使用大语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力相关信息，准确率达到78.2%，展示了在环境AI系统中结构化记录压力的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有重要影响，但在电子健康记录中通常以非结构化文本形式记录，限制了临床效用。环境AI技术虽然能减轻记录负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述。

Method: 开发心理健康压力本体论(MeSO)，整合理论模型和11个验证过的压力评估工具。使用Claude Sonnet 4大语言模型从35篇Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并进行人工评估。

Result: 本体论包含8个顶级类别共181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别172个(78.2%)，错误分类27个(12.3%)，遗漏21个(9.5%)。所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到MeSO。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用本体论指导的大语言模型进行结构化压力信息提取是可行的，有望提高环境AI系统中压力记录的一致性和实用性。未来工作应涉及临床对话数据并在不同LLM间进行比较。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob是一个基于LLM的语义合成管道，用于动态移动性预测，通过多智能体框架从在线文本中提取时空相关信息，并结合时空数据实现更准确的事件驱动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性的突变变化，需要一种能够有效整合文本语义和时空数据的方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，LLM智能体自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关文本，通过创新的渐进融合架构将细粒度相关上下文与时空数据结合。

Result: 在通过该管道构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比时空模型在MAE上最大减少13.92%，在RMSE上最大减少11.12%，在事件发生位置和时间附近的时空区域表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过整合丰富的预训练事件先验知识，显著提升了事件驱动的移动性预测性能，特别是在事件相关的时空区域。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征进行语言模型引导，避免top-k方法中的非语义特征干扰，并引入token-wise衰减引导策略解决恒定引导导致的退化输出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征方法中许多维度捕获的是标点等非语义特征而非语义属性，且恒定SAE引导常产生重复单词等退化输出。

Method: 采用top-1 SAE潜在特征消除冗余，并引入token-wise衰减引导策略，使与平均激活差异基线的比较更可靠。

Result: 引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征能可靠地引发逐步数学推理并提高推理质量，在数学推理基准上优于平均激活差异方法，在IF-Eval上表现相当。

Conclusion: SAE是语言模型引导的有效工具，通过top-1特征选择和token-wise衰减策略能实现更好的推理引导效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

TL;DR: 提出SSTAG方法，通过文本作为统一表示媒介，结合LLM的语义推理和GNN的结构建模能力，解决图学习中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图学习模型通常针对单个数据集训练，缺乏跨图跨任务的泛化能力，且依赖大量标注数据。与NLP和CV不同，图数据的异构性（领域特定特征空间和结构多样性）带来独特挑战。

Method: 采用结构感知的自监督学习方法，通过双重知识蒸馏框架将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知MLP中，并引入内存机制存储典型图表示以整合不变知识。

Result: 在跨域迁移学习任务中超越最先进模型，具有卓越的可扩展性，降低推理成本同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功弥合了LLM语义推理与GNN结构建模之间的差距，为大规模文本属性图提供了有效的跨域泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展的有效方法，为科学AI的可靠训练和评估铺平道路

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单次LLM输出的自监督不确定性估计方法，用于表格数据中的实体链接任务，显著降低计算成本的同时保持高检测低准确率输出的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在实体链接任务中表现出色，但在实际部署中需要可靠的不确定性估计，而现有的多轮推理方法计算成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出的token级特征来估计不确定性，减少对多次生成的需求。

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估显示，该方法能有效检测低准确率输出，且计算成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了一种计算开销有限的不确定性估计实用方案。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文质疑当前语音大语言模型偏见评估中使用的多项选择题格式的有效性，发现这种评估方法在其他MCQA任务和长文本生成任务中缺乏可靠的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见和公平性评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种方法是否能在其他任务格式中保持一致的性能表现尚不明确。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导它们偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案，然后在不同的MCQA基准和长文本生成任务中评估这些行为的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准测试的表现无法可靠预测其他MCQA基准的表现，更重要的是无法预测长文本任务的表现。

Conclusion: 当前的MCQA偏见基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化能力，需要开发新的评估套件来衡量行为可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: AI Watchman是一个纵向审计系统，用于测量和跟踪LLM拒绝行为，揭示公司内容审核政策的变化和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的公司内容审核政策影响，这些拒绝行为反映了公司政策并塑造公共话语，需要透明度。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，审计OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（中英文版本），分析拒绝行为。

Result: 发现公司政策变化（包括未公开宣布的）可通过AI Watchman检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对拒绝形式进行了分类分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实施此类审计的一个系统。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制改进知识图谱问答，使小型开源LLM也能达到竞争性效果，同时显著减少LLM调用和token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索的方法受限于检索信息质量，基于代理的方法过度依赖专有LLM，需要一种既能提升性能又能降低对专有LLM依赖的解决方案。

Method: RJE框架包含检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据三个步骤，并引入推理路径排序、问题分解和检索器辅助探索等专门辅助模块。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时优于现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调即可达到竞争性结果，同时显著减少LLM调用次数和token使用量。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了现有KGQA方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时降低了对专有LLM的依赖，并提升了效率。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

TL;DR: 本研究使用零样本分类方法评估主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和格式化拒绝现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速普及，智能系统在政治话语中占据主导地位，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的政治偏见问题持续存在，需要系统评估。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，通过意识形态对齐、主题性、响应情感和客观性四个指标，对六个主流大语言模型的1800个响应进行分析，使用四个专门微调的分类算法计算偏见评估指标。

Result: 结果显示所有六个大语言模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义对齐倾向，存在明显的推理替代和格式化拒绝现象。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机交互中的心理影响，以及内在偏见如何渗透公共话语，最终可能导致政治景观的扭曲，表现为从众或极化，取决于地区的既有社会政治结构。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过测试OpenAI的200亿参数模型gpt-oss-20b，探究了社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次对模型拒绝行为的影响，发现特定提示组合可以将协助率从0%提升到97.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大型语言模型在面对有害请求时的拒绝行为如何受到提示框架、语言和指令设计的影响，以识别模型安全机制的漏洞。

Method: 使用80次种子迭代测试多个危害领域，包括ZIP炸弹构建、合成卡号生成、不安全驾驶建议等，测试不同提示组合、语言和角色扮演对模型行为的影响。

Result: 发现复合提示（教育者角色+安全前提+步骤提示）能显著提高协助率；德语和法语正式语体比英语更容易泄露；Linux终端角色扮演能覆盖开发者规则；不同推理栈的拒绝率差异达5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: 模型的安全机制存在可被特定提示框架绕过的漏洞，不同语言和推理环境会影响拒绝行为，需要更鲁棒的安全评估方法。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

TL;DR: 研究发现OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20b模型在豪萨语等低资源语言环境中存在严重安全漏洞，包括偏见、文化不敏感和事实错误，模型的安全协议在礼貌语言下会放松，导致有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对来自代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，特别关注低资源语言环境下的安全对齐问题。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的调查验证毒性认知。

Result: 模型错误认为常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂对人类安全，无法区分生熟食物，使用贬低性文化谚语构建错误论点，98%的调查参与者认为这些物质有毒。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于低资源语言环境下安全调优不足，模型优先考虑目标语言的流畅输出而非安全性和真实性，揭示了当前红队测试的重要差距。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Motivation: 现有基于log概率的AI文本检测器存在局限性，需要更优的检测方法来区分人类和LLM生成的文本。

Method: 提出AdaDetectGPT分类器，从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数来增强logits-based检测器的性能。

Result: 在多种数据集和LLM组合中，AdaDetectGPT相比现有最先进方法性能提升高达58%，并提供统计性能保证。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过自适应学习有效提升了AI生成文本检测的准确性和可靠性，在多个场景下均表现优异。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成连贯文本方面表现出色，但其部署存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 采用渐进式自我反思技术，通过多轮自我评估动态修正输出，并引入轻量级自我反思预测器来根据输入复杂度自适应确定反思轮数。

Result: 在多个模型上显著降低攻击成功率：Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct从77.5%降至5.9%，Llama-3.1-8B基础版从89.7%降至5.6%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4%降至3.8%，同时保持良性任务性能。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思作为一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过根据输入风险特征动态分配计算资源，有效提升了大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有基于单步生成信号的幻觉检测方法不适用于多步去噪的D-LLMs。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，每个动作定义为模型基于前一个中间输出对清理后响应的预测，识别对幻觉响应最具有信息量的子轨迹。

Result: 在各种开源D-LLMs上的实验表明，TraceDet持续改进幻觉检测性能，相比基线方法在AUROC上平均提升15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用D-LLMs多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号，有效解决了现有方法不适用于扩散大语言模型的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在情感分析任务中具有巨大潜力，参数高效微调方法使其适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然集成了代码解释器和搜索等工具来增强大语言模型的推理能力，但缺乏关于如何最优使用这些工具的实践指导。核心挑战是如何有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索来处理多样化问题。

Method: 提出Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX)集成框架，并行运行多个代理，每个代理采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径。代理基于问题和先前答案迭代地共享和精炼响应。

Result: 在实验中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时扩展方法取得了显著增益，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上的关键推理基准测试中平均准确率比最佳基线提升高达3.55%，推理成本相近。

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过使用LLM自动优化代理设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅以49%的推理成本保持性能。进一步扩展可以实现更高性能，但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Motivation: 随着具备智能体能力的大语言模型能够无需人类参与完成知识密集型任务，深度研究工具（如能够浏览网页、提取信息并生成多页报告的Deep Research）的出现需要建立相应的评估标准。

Method: 引入一个评估表来评估深度研究工具的能力，并选择学术综述写作作为用例任务，基于该评估表对输出报告进行评估。

Conclusion: 需要精心设计的评估标准来有效评估深度研究工具的能力，当前工具在学术综述写作等知识密集型任务中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

TL;DR: HiSpec是一个分层推测解码框架，利用早退模型进行低开销的中间验证，显著提升大语言模型推理吞吐量，平均提升1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证阶段是瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比token生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用增加和依赖近似启发式导致准确性下降的问题。

Method: 利用早退模型进行中间验证，早退模型允许token跳过层遍历提前退出，且经过训练使得选定层的隐藏状态可解释；重用键值缓存和隐藏状态；定期验证中间验证器接受的draft token。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上的评估显示，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升吞吐量1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早退模型实现高效的中间验证，显著提升推测解码的吞吐量，同时保持准确性，解决了验证瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一个提示框架，通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，提升事件问答性能，在TORQUESTRA基准上平均准确率提高5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在一般语言任务上表现出色，但在需要因果或时序推理的事件问题上表现不佳。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置（3种策略×3种输入模态）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准上，TAG-EQA比纯文本基线平均准确率提高5%，零样本设置下最高提升12%，图增强CoT提示有效时提升18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

*Nicolás Aguirre,Ramiro Caso,Ramiro Rodríguez Colmeiro,Mauro Santelli,Joaquín Toranzo Calderón*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本自动评估语言模型响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么成本过高（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么与现实条件差距较大（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且经济的解决方案。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离将目标候选与任意LM生成文本进行匹配，通过小于100亿参数的嵌入模型实现低成本响应分类。

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，相对于人类标注者获得了约0.97的回归分数和约96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本相对较低且鲁棒的语言模型响应分类方案，在自动评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，通过两阶段微调框架和奖励函数优化子问题生成，在金融领域复杂QA任务中显著提升性能，仅需少量训练数据和单GPU即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域特定定量推理中的挑战，特别是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域，如金融领域。

Method: 基于两阶段微调框架构建EQD方法，使用奖励函数衡量生成子问题对改善问答结果的有效性，仅需数千训练样本和单A100 GPU进行微调。

Result: 在金融领域的四个基准数据集上，EQD持续提升不同LLM的QA性能0.6%至10.5%，超越领域调优模型和先进提示策略。

Conclusion: 在领域特定QA中，单个支持性问题往往比详细指导步骤提供更大收益，EQD在平衡领域知识与计算效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一个递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过递归推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在可扩展性方面表现出色，但在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面仍面临挑战，主要由于僵化的层级堆叠、密集注意力和对位置编码的依赖。

Method: ReSSFormer集成了三个互补创新：递归推理与记忆单元(R2MU)用于有界深度的迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)用于高效聚焦的上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)用于无位置的结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在可比较的FLOPs和参数预算下始终优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer通过用递归推理替代传统深度堆叠，用稀疏注意力替代全注意力，直接从内容建模潜在token拓扑，展现了其可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE是一种基于隐藏状态的无参数验证器，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态轨迹来验证输出正确性，在多项基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM输出质量评估方法存在局限性：基于文本的方法容易过拟合表面特征，基于概率校准的方法在不校准模型上失效。而隐藏状态同时包含语义特征和置信度信息，是更丰富的信息源。

Method: 提出CLUE验证器，无训练参数，仅通过计算隐藏状态增量，使用最近质心距离将推理轨迹分类到"成功"和"失败"聚类中。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA基准测试中，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超过现代置信度方法，显著提升准确率。例如在AIME 24上，将1.5B模型的准确率从56.7%提升到70.0%。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态轨迹编码了解决方案正确性的几何可分特征，为LLM输出验证提供了统一且强大的基础信号。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Result: 实验观察到所有策略在EM和F1生成质量指标上获得大致相当的改进，但计算成本存在显著差异。

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PureTC-1B是一个针对传统中文优化的1B参数小语言模型，通过三阶段稳定化流程显著减少非传统中文字符输出，在真实场景中实现51.3%的相对改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在传统中文应用中存在token级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 使用三阶段稳定化流程：基于传统中文语料的持续预训练、指令数据的监督微调、以及使用传统中文偏好进行直接偏好优化，采用参数高效的LoRA适配器而不需要完整模型重训练。

Result: 在模拟真实使用场景的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型减少了51.3%的非传统中文输出token；在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言token。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下也能实现稳健的传统中文一致性，该流程可重现、仅需适配器且硬件友好，为传统中文及其他非英语语言提供了实用的语言稳定性增强方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于僵化的手工构建图拓扑，缺乏上下文响应性，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降。

Method: 引入动态图设计器，通过轻量级LLM适配自主识别任务特定的最优图配置，利用输入的内在属性智能引导查询通过任务优化的智能体路径。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统性地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于不同的LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可以通过操纵输入文本来获取不良响应（越狱提示），这些提示旨在绕过安全防护机制，因此需要开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 研究比较了不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和正常使用的能力，包括检测使用新策略的越狱提示，重点关注了端到端微调BERT模型的方法。

Result: 使用当前数据集，端到端微调的BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳，研究还可视化区分越狱提示和正常提示的关键词。

Conclusion: 提示结构中的显式自反性可能是越狱意图的信号，微调BERT模型是当前检测越狱提示的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归LLM在语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但在文本嵌入任务中应用较慢，且受限于单向注意力机制，难以分析其语义表示。

Method: 通过额外训练步骤测试Llama架构的不同变体，逐步启用双向注意力和无监督/有监督对比学习。

Result: 论文正在探索阶段，尚未报告具体结果。

Conclusion: 研究旨在验证双向注意力是否能克服自回归LLM在文本嵌入任务中的限制。

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Motivation: 网络安全领域缺乏统一的框架来定义和评估闭环自主安全代理的能力，现有研究碎片化，无法有效衡量代理在完整安全生命周期中的表现。

Method: 引入CLASP框架，将安全生命周期（侦察、利用、根因分析、补丁合成、验证）与核心代理能力（规划、工具使用、记忆、推理、反思与感知）对齐，并定义CLC评分来量化闭环程度和操作有效性。

Result: 应用CLASP分析了21个代表性工作，识别了系统优势和能力差距，建立了评估闭环安全代理的统一标准。

Conclusion: CLASP框架和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和衡量闭环安全代理提供了必要的词汇、诊断工具和测量方法。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Motivation: 多模态对话摘要任务需要强大的自动评估方法来降低成本，但缺乏基于人类标注的元评估基准。

Method: 提出了基于跨模态互斥关键信息（MEKI）的过滤框架来确保数据质量，并首次识别和形式化了MDS特有的关键评估维度。

Result: 基准测试了最先进的模态评估方法，揭示了它们在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面的局限性以及对各种偏见的敏感性。

Conclusion: MDSEval为多模态对话摘要评估提供了首个全面的元评估基准，有助于改进自动评估方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的三角色对话结构，实现自我修正推理，在数学推理任务上表现优于单次提示，对小模型提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如CoT和ToT缺乏外部质疑机制来引导自我修正，需要一种能够通过质疑促进推理改进的方法。

Method: 采用三角色对话协议：Defender提出初始答案，Objectioner提出质疑但不直接修复，Host确保对话一致性和结论达成。纯提示级实现，无需模型重训练。

Result: 在GSM8K上比单次提示提升约22个百分点，与CoT精度相当；小模型Llama3.2:1b准确率提升约19%；GPT-4.1评估显示推理和连贯性评分提高10%以上。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting通过质疑引导的自我修正机制有效提升推理质量，特别适合小模型和本地设备使用，支持大规模研究质疑引导推理。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，识别出组合性和直接性两种处理机制，发现直接机制在嵌入空间存在线性映射时占主导地位。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务的方式取决于嵌入空间几何特性，当存在线性映射时倾向于使用直接机制而非真正的组合推理。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中SFT训练数据的轮次分布偏斜导致LLM出现格式惯性问题，模型倾向于生成重复但诊断信息不足的格式正确问题。

Method: 采用数据中心的简单方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 通过重新平衡训练数据的轮次分布可以有效缓解LLM在医疗预咨询任务中的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: MathLens是一个新的多模态推理基准测试，专门用于分解几何问题的子技能，包括感知、推理和整合三个组件，揭示了不同训练方法对各项技能的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推理模型评估主要依赖聚合准确率，这种单一分数无法揭示模型在哪些方面以及如何改进。需要设计能够分解多模态推理子技能的基准测试。

Method: 开发MathLens基准测试，将性能分解为三个组件：感知（从原始输入提取信息）、推理（操作可用信息）、整合（选择相关感知证据并在推理中应用）。通过视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知探针等注释来支持各项测试。

Result: 分析发现：1）强化学习主要加强感知能力，特别是配合文本监督时；2）推理能力只能与感知能力同步提升；3）整合能力是最薄弱的环节；4）不同训练方法的鲁棒性表现不同：RL提高图表变化下的稳定性，而多模态SFT因过拟合而降低稳定性。

Conclusion: MathLens基准测试能够有效分解多模态推理的子技能，揭示了不同训练方法对各技能的差异化影响，整合能力是需要重点改进的薄弱环节，训练方法的鲁棒性表现存在差异。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管工业工作数字化是目标，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍然主要是文档中心的。需要将这些信息转化为机器可解释的格式以实现自动化验证。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准。这些模块以W3C兼容格式存储，并与顶级本体ISO DIS 23726-3对齐。通过语义推理和可执行设计规则进行验证。

Result: 成功测试了基于国际标准和行业规范的阀门选择过程。能够自动验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准，并确定产品类型是否满足阀门规格。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化本体使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了这种方法对于希望过渡到数字化智能标准的标准化机构的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

TL;DR: 提出Refusal Index (RI)指标，通过拒绝概率与错误概率的秩相关来准确衡量LLM的知识感知拒绝能力，解决了现有指标在测量模型拒绝未知问题能力时的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确衡量LLM的知识感知拒绝能力：简单的拒绝率指标受拒绝倾向影响，校准指标是代理指标而非实际拒绝行为。需要开发能忠实测量LLM拒绝未知问题能力的指标。

Method: 定义RI为拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关系数，设计轻量级两轮评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行中的观察拒绝率来有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定，提供与模型整体准确率和拒绝率无关的一致模型排名。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLM事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLM在事实任务中达到高准确率，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠和脆弱。需要将传统准确率指标与RI结合进行全面的真实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频连贯性和覆盖率/块完整性指标与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度显示强负相关性。LLM评估得分表现中等，表明无监督指标可扩展筛选但不能完全替代法律领域的人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律自然语言处理的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标（包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别）评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，并通过7168份专家评审（1-5李克特量表）进行验证。

Result: 词频连贯性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最一致，法律术语密度显示强负相关性（Pearson r=-0.479），LLM评估得分表现中等（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于LLM的方法）可实现可扩展筛选，但由于中等相关性和低一致性系数，在高风险法律环境中不能完全替代人类判断。这项工作通过提供无需标注的评估工具推进了法律NLP发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的垃圾评论高度逼真，对现有检测系统构成威胁，需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和门控图变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Result: 在三个LLM生成的数据集上，FraudSquad比最先进基线在精确率和召回率上分别提升44.22%和43.01%，在人类撰写的垃圾数据集上也表现良好。

Conclusion: FraudSquad模型尺寸小、训练数据需求少，是适应LLM时代垃圾检测的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题解决中存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表述陌生的题目也会出错。通过使用正确示例的语法模板重述问题，可以显著提高回答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs在数学推理中存在系统性失败模式——当问题表述偏离训练分布时，即使语义简单，模型也会错误应用熟悉的推理策略。

Method: 使用依赖局部性理论(DLT)量化语法复杂度，通过从正确示例中提取语法模板来重述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度。

Result: 重述后的问题往往能得到正确答案，更高的DLT分数与多个数据集中失败率的增加相关，表明语法复杂度是影响模型表现的关键因素。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构错位而非概念难度，语法感知的干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败，表明LLMs的数学能力受表面形式与内部表征耦合的脆弱性影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Motivation: HTML表格、列表和信息框等半结构化内容在网络上占很大比例，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页都需要LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用同网站网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并通过在CommonCrawl数据上进行迭代训练来改进。

Result: 在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提升超过4%，实现了可扩展且资源高效的网络信息提取。

Conclusion: SCRIBES通过生成可重用脚本的方法，解决了半结构化网络内容提取的挑战，实现了比现有方法更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Conclusion: 多模态模型在纯语言任务中存在性能下降问题，通过与纯语言模型进行参数融合可以部分改善这一状况，同时保持多模态性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Result: 在多个模型家族中，编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著减少知识遗忘。

Conclusion: REPAIR为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演进的LLM提供了一个稳健框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning

introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide

Conclusion: ILM为下一代LLMs奠定了基础，使其更具鲁棒性、基础化、可控性和可信性。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to

inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在线强化学习对于精确和可信的声明验证非常有效，为未来研究提供了基础，并发布了代码以支持社区在LLM赋能的声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索语言模型能否通过多维主观标注来预测个体价值解释，发现同时提供SEAT四个维度能显著提升预测性能，强调考虑个体主观标注行为的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于价值概念的解释受社会文化背景和生活经历影响而具有主观性，需要开发能适应不同人类视角的AI系统，避免偏向多数观点。

Method: 使用SEAT维度作为个体解释视角的代理，评估语言模型在不同零样本和少样本设置下预测个体价值解释的能力。

Result: 实验表明同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度或无个体信息的基线表现更好，且个体间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计学特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的尝试，为未来大规模验证奠定了基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了数据库模式规范化对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，发现非规范化模式在简单检索查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多在固定模式上评估NL2SQL模型，忽视了模式设计对性能的重要影响。本文旨在系统研究模式规范化程度如何影响NL2SQL系统的表现。

Method: 构建了具有不同规范化级别(1NF-3NF)的合成数据集和真实学术论文数据集，评估了八个领先大语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用成本效益高的零样本模型；规范化模式在聚合查询中表现更好，但存在基表选择和连接类型预测错误，这些问题可通过少样本示例显著缓解。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型，开发时应考虑模式设计并集成自适应模式选择机制。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过系统实验比较了传统方法、预训练模型和LLM在低资源环境下的表现，发现文化语言基础预训练对鲁棒性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语等低资源语言缺乏有效的仇恨言论检测工具，现有研究多为单任务且覆盖有限，需要更全面的多维度检测系统来提升在线安全。

Method: 构建大规模人工标注的多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集，系统比较传统基线方法、单语预训练模型和LLM在零样本提示及LoRA微调下的表现。

Result: LoRA微调的LLM与BanglaBERT表现相当，但文化和语言基础的预训练对鲁棒性能仍然关键，多任务数据集显著提升了检测能力。

Conclusion: 建立了孟加拉语仇恨言论检测的更强基准，强调了文化对齐预训练在低资源环境中的重要性，为开发文化适应的审核工具提供了基础。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究从过程导向角度评估大语言模型的创造力，引入基于约束的决策作为作者创造力的分析框架，发现LLMs在创作中一致性地优先考虑风格而非其他元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在通过叙事学视角将LLMs视为计算作者，分析其创作过程中的创造性偏好。

Method: 使用受控提示分配作者角色，分析模型的创作偏好，并探究模型选择背后的推理过程。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在创作中一致性地强调风格元素，优先于角色、事件和场景等其他元素，不同模型展现出独特的创作特征剖面。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析AI作者创造力提供了新颖的系统性工具，揭示了LLMs在创作过程中的特定偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，在端到端语音对话系统中集成工具使用，通过并行预测工具查询来降低延迟，提高问答准确性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉，缺乏事实基础。需要将文本对话系统中的工具集成方法扩展到语音系统中。

Method: 开发Streaming RAG框架，在用户说话时并行预测工具查询，设计后训练流程教导模型何时发出工具调用以及如何融合音频查询和检索结果生成语音摘要。

Result: 在AudioCRAG基准测试中，问答准确率相对提升200%（从11.1%提升到34.2%），工具使用延迟降低20%。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG方法显著提高了语音对话系统的准确性和响应性，且该方法与模态无关，可应用于文本输入，为更智能的实时AI助手铺平道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCoT框架，一种用于双工口语对话系统的流式思维链方法，通过交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应，解决了传统VAD无法区分停顿和话轮结束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端口语对话系统依赖语音活动检测进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分停顿和话轮完成。现有双工SDS模型虽然通过连续预测输出（包括静音标记）消除了对显式VAD的需求，但架构复杂且在语义推理方面落后于级联模型。

Method: 提出SCoT（流式思维链）框架，交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应。使用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标——对齐的用户转录和系统响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时相比逐话轮系统支持更低延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架成功解决了双工SDS系统的关键挑战，在保持低延迟和重叠交互能力的同时，显著提升了响应的连贯性和可解释性。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码已成为系统减少大语言模型解码时间的标准技术，但研究发现其速度提升在不同任务间分布不均，对欠拟合和代表性不足任务的加速效果较差，存在不公平现象。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码的不公平性，识别导致差异速度提升的因素，并基于这些见解提出缓解策略来减少速度提升差异。

Result: 提出的缓解策略在多个模型对上验证，公平性指标平均提升了12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码存在任务间速度提升差异的问题，需要专门策略来缓解这种不公平性，以更公平地应用于不同任务。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一个自约束强化学习框架，通过自我惩罚机制利用无标注数据提升推理模型的性能，在多个推理基准上实现了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人工标注数据的强化学习在推理任务中成本高昂且在复杂任务上表现不佳，需要一种能够在无标注数据上持续自我改进的方法。

Method: 提出RESTRAIN框架，利用模型的完整答案分布信号，惩罚过度自信的rollouts和低一致性样本，同时保留有前景的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在AIME25上Pass@1提升达+140.7%，MMLU_STEM上+36.2%，GPQA-Diamond上+19.6%，几乎达到使用黄金标注训练的效果，但完全不需要黄金标注。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标注的强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

TL;DR: 提出了RL4HS强化学习框架，通过span级奖励函数激励推理过程，在RAGTruth基准测试中超越预训练推理模型和监督微调，有效检测幻觉span。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉内容，而现有方法大多将幻觉检测视为二元任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉span，这是一个多步骤决策过程。

Method: 提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，引入Class-Aware Policy Optimization解决奖励不平衡问题，使用span级奖励函数激励推理。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）中，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用span级奖励的强化学习对于检测幻觉span是必要的，显式推理有助于复杂的幻觉检测任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SPINACH的通用方法，通过LLM代理将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询，采用迭代探索和执行过程而非单次转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SPARQL查询语言对非计算机背景用户存在较高学习门槛，需要降低知识图谱交互的障碍，通过LLM实现Text2SPARQL翻译来改善用户体验。

Method: 基于SPINACH LLM代理，采用迭代探索和执行过程，将自然语言问题逐步转换为SPARQL查询，而非一次性转换。

Result: 开发了整体架构并进行了深入的行为分析，为未来针对性改进提供了见解。

Conclusion: 该方法通过迭代过程有效降低了SPARQL查询的门槛，为Text2SPARQL领域的发展提供了有价值的贡献。

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Motivation: 现有评估只关注执行准确性而忽视推理过程是否与真实动作对齐，这可能导致用户基于看似合理的推理链授权有害动作，造成财务损失或信任危机。

Method: 引入真实对齐(GTA)指标来衡量推理链中隐含的动作是否与真实动作匹配，结合精确匹配(EM)共同评估推理准确性和执行准确性，识别执行差距和推理差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能可靠反映最先进模型中的系统性执行/推理差距模式，为开发更可信的移动智能体提供具体诊断支持。

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应多指导策略优化(AMPO)框架，通过按需使用多个教师模型的指导来增强大语言模型的长链推理能力，相比单教师方法显著提升了推理多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要依赖自探索或单一教师模型，容易引入模型偏见并限制探索，从而影响推理多样性和性能。受知识蒸馏中多教师策略启发，希望开发能自适应利用多个熟练教师指导的方法。

Method: AMPO框架在策略模型无法生成正确解时自适应地利用多个熟练教师模型的指导，采用"按需指导"方法扩展探索同时保留自我发现价值，并包含基于理解的筛选机制让学生从最可能理解的推理路径中学习。

Result: 在数学推理任务上比强基线(GRPO)提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%，显著提高了Pass@k性能并实现了更多样化的探索。使用四个同等规模教师即可达到与使用单个更强大教师方法相当的结果。

Conclusion: AMPO为获得卓越推理能力和泛化能力提供了一条更高效和可扩展的路径，证明了多教师策略在增强语言模型推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As
a result, the outcomes are generalize

*Tianyi Jiang,Yi Bin,Yujuan Ding,Kainian Zhu,Fei Ma,Jingkuan Song,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Token熵累积平均(TECA)指标和累积熵调控(CER)机制，通过"简要探索然后决策"范式解决LLMs在简单问题上过度思考的问题，显著减少推理长度而不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上会产生不必要的冗长推理步骤(过度思考)，这降低了模型效率且难以根据问题复杂度自适应调整推理深度。

Method: 引入TECA指标衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出CER机制和"简要探索然后决策"范式，帮助模型动态确定最优停止点并给出最终答案。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著缓解了过度思考问题，在简单数据集上平均响应长度减少高达71%，同时保持问题解决能力。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了更高效和自适应的推理过程，能在不牺牲性能的前提下大幅减少推理长度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoMosaic-Bench是首个专注于工具增强智能体中多源信息寻求的基准测试，涵盖六个领域，要求智能体结合通用搜索和领域特定工具来解决复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体过度依赖开放网络搜索，存在内容嘈杂不可靠和缺乏精确领域知识的问题。MCP协议虽然提供了访问专业工具的接口，但智能体是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合仍不明确。

Method: 开发了InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，使用InfoMosaic-Flow流程合成任务，将任务条件基于已验证的工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖关系，并过滤掉可通过简单查找解决的捷径案例。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM智能体的实验显示：仅使用网络信息时GPT-5准确率仅38.2%；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的收益；22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在基本工具处理方面仍存在困难，需要开发更有效的工具使用策略来充分利用多源信息寻求能力。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于英语的强化学习后训练（RPT）所获得推理能力是否能有效迁移到其他语言，发现跨语言迁移性因模型、目标语言和训练范式而异，并提出平行训练能显著提升跨语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强化学习推理在任务或模态间的泛化，而本研究从跨语言角度探索推理泛化，检验英语中心的大推理模型（LRMs）在其他语言上的推理能力迁移效果。

Method: 通过系统评估英语中心LRMs在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言迁移性的指标，并进行干预性研究和平行训练实验。

Result: 发现跨语言迁移性差异显著，强英语能力模型过度依赖英语特定模式导致跨语言泛化减弱；平行训练带来"首次平行跃升"和"平行缩放定律"，揭示跨语言推理迁移遵循幂律关系。

Conclusion: 英语中心LRMs未能完全跨语言泛化，挑战了LRM推理模仿人类认知的假设，为开发更语言无关的LRMs提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前LLM竞技场评估中平局处理的合理性，认为平局更多反映查询难度而非模型实力相当，建议忽略平局时的评分更新能提高预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑当前将LLM竞技场评估中的平局视为模型实力相等的做法，认为平局更可能反映查询难度而非模型能力差异。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，研究忽略平局时的评分更新对四种评分系统的影响，并分析平局与查询特性的关系。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使四种评分系统的对战结果预测准确率相对提高1-3%，平局更多出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中。

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统重新考虑平局语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询特性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

TL;DR: 研究竞争市场中存在逆向选择时的信息披露问题，卖家知道产品质量但买家不知道，通过设计公共信号来优化交易量或价格与剩余的组合目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在竞争市场逆向选择环境下，如何通过信息披露设计来优化市场效率，因为卖家的交易参与决策本身会传递质量信息，给设计者带来内生约束。

Method: 将设计者的问题重新表述为具有额外条件的鞅最优传输问题，该条件排除了通过卖家参与决策进一步传递信息的可能性，并描述了最优信号的特征。

Result: 当最大化交易量时，解决方案表现为低效率和高效率卖家的负向匹配；当目标是价格和剩余的加权组合时，只要价格权重足够高，最优信号保持这种结构，否则会完全揭示低质量类型，同时将中等类型与高质量卖家合并。

Conclusion: 在竞争性逆向选择市场中，最优信息披露策略取决于设计者的目标函数，不同目标会导致不同的信息结构设计。

Abstract: We study information disclosure in competitive markets with adverse
selection. Sellers privately observe product quality, with higher quality
entailing higher production costs, while buyers trade at the market-clearing
price after observing a public signal. Because sellers' participation in trade
conveys information about quality, the designer faces endogenous constraints in
the set of posteriors that she can induce. We reformulate the designer's
problem as a martingale optimal transport exercise with an additional condition
that rules out further information transmission through sellers' participation
decisions, and characterize the optimal signals. When the designer maximizes
trade volume, the solution features negative-assortative matching of
inefficient and efficient sellers. When the objective is a weighted combination
of price and surplus, optimal signals preserve this structure as long as the
weight on the price is high enough, otherwise they fully reveal low-quality
types while pooling middle types with high-quality sellers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新研究尾指数回归，发现在极端条件下传统回归方法可能失效，需要更深入理解尾部回归的统计特性。

Method: 分析线性规范下的尾指数回归，研究条件协变量分布在尾部的行为特性，探讨局部非参数尾指数回归的收敛性质。

Result: 发现极端结果条件下回归变量会退化为常数，条件协变量分布集中在尾指数最小化的值上，远离这些点时条件密度趋于零，局部非参数回归收敛速度很慢。

Conclusion: 为应用工作提供实用建议，强调在尾部回归分析中需要注意传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: We revisit tail-index regressions. For linear specifications, we find that
the usual full-rank condition can fail because conditioning on extreme outcomes
causes regressors to degenerate to constants. More generally, the conditional
distribution of the covariates in the tails concentrates on the values at which
the tail index is minimized. Away from those points, the conditional density
tends to zero. For local nonparametric tail index regression, the convergence
rate can be very slow. We conclude with practical suggestions for applied work.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Motivation: 温度采样虽然能增加语言模型输出的多样性，但在需要高精度的数学推理任务中，不受控制的高温采样会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样到错误的续写。

Method: 训练一个轻量级分类器来预测采样风险，该风险指标估计在当前词元位置应用高温采样时输出错误的可能性。基于此风险指标，动态在贪婪采样和高温采样之间切换。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法能够有效解决高温采样在精度敏感任务中的准确性问题，同时保持输出多样性，且集成到基础语言模型中的延迟开销很小。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了交互式网络探索工具。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法面临无约束方向误差和次优比特分配两大问题。

Method: 提出两个几何驱动创新：(1)误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；(2)权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Conclusion: RSAVQ为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Result: 在CIFAR-10上：(1)建立准确率稳步提升的基线；(2)通过Dirichlet扫描显示增加客户端重叠能持续提高准确率并降低ASR；(3)信号预算研究表明准确率保持稳定而ASR增加、ROC-AUC下降；(4)与随机、线性Q和策略梯度控制器比较，DQN实现最佳鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 序列信念更新能缓解弱信号影响，DQN方法在联邦学习防御中实现了最优的鲁棒性-准确性平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway

approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

### [99] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过局部流量预算（活动率×扇出）来平衡选择性和传播范围，提高编码熵和去相关性，在多种网络架构中提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于损失影响（如幅度或梯度）来移除参数，本文旨在通过局部流量预算来优化网络结构，实现更高效和多样化的表示学习。

Method: BB为每个单元分配局部流量预算（活动率×扇出），通过约束熵分析得出选择性-受众平衡公式，使用简单的局部执行器剪枝扇入（降低活动率）或扇出（减少传播）。

Result: BB在ASR的Transformers、人脸识别的ResNets和突触预测的3D U-Nets中提高了编码熵和去相关性，在相同稀疏度下精度提升，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上达到最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更高效和多样化的表示提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive
manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support
scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios
demonstrate the framework's ability to model and train robust policies for
morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high
throughput and simulation realism. Code and benchmarks are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLP是一种在预训练阶段引入强化学习的创新方法，通过将思维链视为探索性动作，基于信息增益计算奖励，鼓励模型在预测前独立思考，显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练范式只在后训练阶段引入强化学习，这可能不是最优方式。作者希望将强化学习的探索精神更早地引入到预训练阶段，以培养模型的独立思考能力。

Method: 提出RLP强化预训练目标，将思维链视为探索动作，奖励基于思维链为预测未来token提供的信息增益计算。这种方法产生无验证器的密集奖励信号，可在预训练期间对完整文档流进行高效训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上使用RLP预训练，在8个数学和科学基准测试中平均提升19%。在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上，总体平均从42.81%提升至61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功地将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理出现之间的差距，证明了该方法在不同架构和模型规模上的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，避免了对精确系统模型的依赖，同时解决了RL训练期间的安全风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的振动控制方法需要繁琐的系统辨识过程，而纯RL方法在训练期间缺乏先验知识，可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好，这启发了混合控制框架的提出。

Method: 开发了LQR和RL的混合控制框架，其中LQR策略来自随机选择的模型和参数，不需要真实或近似结构模型知识，使整个框架保持无模型特性。LQR控制器在RL训练初期提供指导，降低探索风险。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中固有的探索风险。据作者所知，这是首个解决RL振动控制训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究。

Conclusion: 提出的LQR-RL混合控制框架成功解决了RL振动控制中的训练安全问题，无需精确系统模型，为实际工程应用提供了可行的无模型振动控制方案。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的方法来识别和分析RNN中的信息传递节点（信息中继），通过量化节点间输入输出向量的互信息来追踪信息流动路径，并在多种RNN架构上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来识别信息传递的关键节点。

Method: 使用信息论方法量化节点间互信息，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，同时进行节点敲除实验验证功能重要性。

Result: 揭示了不同架构中信息中继的独特模式，展示了信息如何随时间处理和维持，节点敲除实验证实了识别节点对网络行为的重要影响。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了我们对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，一种无需辅助信息的非对比PU学习方法，通过NoiSNCL损失和PLD方案解决复杂数据集上PU学习性能不佳的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上性能显著低于监督学习方法（如CIFAR-100上差距达14.26%），主要瓶颈是在不可靠监督下学习判别性表征的挑战

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比监督损失（NoiSNCL）和幻影标签消歧（PLD）方案，NoiSNCL在不可靠监督下对齐类内表征，PLD通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守的负监督

Result: NoiSNCL使简单PU方法达到竞争性能；NcPU在多种数据集上显著优于最先进的PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损伤测绘等实际应用场景

Conclusion: NcPU框架通过理论上的EM框架迭代优化，在复杂数据集上实现了PU学习性能的显著提升，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

TL;DR: 受微眼动启发，提出一种轻量级位置编码扰动方法，无需微调即可检测LLM在事实性、安全性、毒性等方面的错误行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量级扰动来揭示LLM的潜在错误信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过扰动引发模型内部信号来指示错误行为。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测事实性、安全性、毒性及后门攻击等各类错误，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练LLM已编码了标记自身错误所需的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思维自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-淘汰策略，根据思维重要性分配token精度，并在推理轨迹演化时逐步淘汰不太重要的思维token，仅使用不到5%的原始KV缓存即可实现接近无损的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展的思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性揭示思维链中不同重要性思维类型的观察，采用混合量化-淘汰策略，根据思维重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演化逐步淘汰不太重要的思维token。设计扩展PagedAttention的内核，实现被淘汰token内存槽的高效重用，消除压缩开销。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill、GPT-OSS和NVIDIA AceReason上的数学和编码基准测试表明，ThinKV使用不到5%的原始KV缓存实现了接近无损的精度，同时相比最先进的基线方法，推理吞吐量提高了5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV有效解决了大型推理模型中KV缓存快速增长的内存瓶颈问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进机器学习技术在现实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI

shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,

TL;DR: 本文研究两层神经网络训练损失梯度的低秩结构，放宽了训练数据和参数的各向同性假设。在尖峰数据模型中，我们发现输入权重梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导：一个与数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的尖峰对齐。


<details>

Motivation: 传统分析通常假设训练数据和参数是各向同性的，这限制了理论结果的实际适用性。本文旨在研究在更一般的非各向同性数据分布下，神经网络梯度的结构特性。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，允许数据主体部分为各向异性和病态，不要求数据和权重矩阵独立。分析了均值场和神经正切核两种缩放机制，并研究了激活函数、数据属性和缩放机制对梯度结构的影响。

Result: 梯度相对于输入权重近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导。标准正则化方法（如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚）选择性地调节这些成分。合成和真实数据实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 神经网络梯度在非各向同性数据下仍保持低秩结构，这一结构由数据特性和训练机制共同决定，正则化方法能够选择性地影响不同的梯度成分。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: 提出一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，测试现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在真实数据集上表现差异很大，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法，因为真实数据集通常位于具有小内在维度的潜在流形上。

Method: 构建量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，并测试多种IDE方法。

Result: 测试的IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性普遍低于现有基准，且随着非均匀曲率增加性能下降最小，表明基准本身具有固有难度。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准提供了更严格的IDE方法评估，揭示了现有方法在复杂流形上的局限性，并成功应用于非流形空间的有效维度提取。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其底层原理理解不足。现有方法通常被视为经验性启发式设计，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种训练范式：SDMI（需要交替优化和stop-gradient操作）和JMI（允许联合优化和对称架构）。

Result: 证明了现有SSRL方法是这两种范式的具体实例或近似，为预测器网络、stop-gradient操作和统计正则化器等组件提供了理论解释。

Conclusion: 该研究为自监督表示学习的架构设计选择提供了理论依据，超越了经验性便利，建立了学习目标与优化策略之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量化数据集各向异性（对称性破缺）的度量方法，通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来区分原始数据集与其随机增强版本。研究发现多个基准点云数据集存在高度对齐性，并证明分布对称性破缺可能阻碍不变方法的优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"。本文旨在批判性评估这一假设，开发量化数据集各向异性的方法。

Method: 提出基于双样本神经网络分类器的度量方法，通过区分原始数据集与随机增强版本量化各向异性。在合成数据集上验证该方法，并应用于基准点云数据集分析。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐性。理论分析表明，分布对称性破缺可能阻止不变方法达到最优性能，即使底层标签确实是不变的。实证结果显示等变方法的有效性具有数据集依赖性。

Conclusion: 理解等变性（包括其何时有效及原因）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差，等变方法在某些各向异性数据集上仍有益处，但在其他数据集上则不然。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习分数函数用于生成样本，但一个基本未解问题是：它们实际学习的是哪个分数？如果完全匹配经验分数会简单复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Result: 研究结果表明选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为理解其泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化能力的关键机制，优秀模型在特定区域精确逼近分数函数而在其他区域欠拟合，这解释了它们能够生成新颖样本的原因。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型（MDM）的推理时自校正，通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力——在推理时检测和修正低质量token。虽然掩码扩散模型在离散空间生成建模中表现出色，但其自校正能力尚未被充分理解。现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用范围。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传递中计算，用于检测低质量token。该方法理论上有保障，无需强化学习或验证器。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独游戏、无条件文本生成（1.7亿参数）以及使用LLaDA的代码生成（80亿参数）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种有效且通用的推理时自校正方法，无需改变现有模型架构或训练过程，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数

Conclusion: 在最优停止理论与推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩-重建框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，实现了高效计算与高质量重建的平衡。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）虽然能保护敏感数据，但会降低模型性能和公平性，特别是对少数群体。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，保持梯度相对大小同时限制敏感度，结合自适应机制。

Result: 在MIMIC-III、GOSSIS-eICU和Adult Income等数据集上测试，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少达48%，且差异减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Motivation: 虽然Softmax注意力的高效替代方案已被广泛研究，但基于理论洞察的更具表达力机制（即使计算成本更高）的探索相对不足。

Method: 从测试时回归视角推导LLA，提出两种内存高效原语解决计算复杂度问题，开发FlashLLA硬件高效块状算法，实现定制推理内核减少内存开销。

Result: LLA在测试时回归、上下文回归、关联回忆和状态跟踪任务中有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，展现出在大规模模型中可扩展性和适用性的前景。

Conclusion: LLA通过理论优势和实践验证，为注意力机制提供了新的研究方向，特别是在处理非平稳数据和需要更强表达能力的场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Motivation: 在机器学习的可靠部署中，OOD检测至关重要，但现有扩散模型方法计算成本高昂，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将雅可比迹和得分函数平方范数结合为单一测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传播和一次JVP计算。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域提供了快速可靠的OOD检测实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集管理。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Motivation: 尽管MBPO在OpenAI Gym中表现出色，但在DeepMind Control Suite中却表现不佳，这揭示了环境特定假设如何隐式编码到算法设计中。研究旨在理解合成数据何时有帮助、何时会失败及其原因。

Method: 分析MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中的失败模式，识别出两个关键问题：动力学模型与奖励模型的尺度不匹配，以及目标表示选择不当导致的模型方差问题。

Result: 解决这些失败模式后，MBPO在7个DMC任务中的5个超越了其模型对应物SAC，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中的强性能。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁社区开发将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失败模式联系起来的分类法，追求统一解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何最终塑造算法泛化的条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

TL;DR: 提出LSPO算法，基于响应长度动态选择训练数据，提升RLVR在推理任务中的学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受LLMs中过度思考现象研究的启发，旨在改进RLVR算法在推理任务中的训练效率

Method: LSPO（Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization），一种元RLVR算法，根据平均响应长度动态选择每步的训练数据

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上评估，LSPO持续提升学习效果，并通过消融研究分析长度信号的不同整合方式

Conclusion: LSPO方法有效，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

*Lu Li,Tianwei Ni,Yihao Sun,Pierre-Luc Bacon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释离线到在线强化学习中的不一致性，强调在在线微调过程中需要根据离线数据集和预训练策略的相对性能来平衡知识保持和学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习在实践中表现出高度不一致性，相同的在线微调设计选择在不同场景下效果差异巨大，需要理论框架来解释和指导设计选择。

Method: 提出稳定性-可塑性原则，将在线微调分为三个不同机制，每个机制需要不同的稳定性特性，并通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个案例中，实证结果与框架预测高度一致，验证了该原则的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的原则性框架，用于指导离线到在线强化学习中的设计选择。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

*Haotian Xiang,Jinwen Xu,Qin Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，使用LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层来处理高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题，并通过集成方法自动选择超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程在应对高维不规则变量（如分类、序数变量）的黑盒优化问题时表现不佳，而神经网络代理模型计算成本高。受LLM强大能力启发，将其作为代理模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为代理模型，采用LoRA进行轻量级微调，结合变分贝叶斯线性层（VBLL）框架。开发了LoRA-VBLL集成方法，自动选择LoRA秩等超参数，并通过递归贝叶斯更新模型权重。

Result: 在各种高维基准测试和真实世界分子优化任务中，所提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理模型结合LoRA-VBLL框架能够有效解决高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题，在保持计算效率的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过分区搜索空间、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，有效解决传统方法的探索偏差问题，在保证精度的同时显著降低延迟和搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬件感知神经架构搜索方法需要多GPU天训练超级网络，而基于大语言模型的方法虽然能快速反馈但存在探索偏差，无法在整个搜索空间中发现不同延迟范围的架构。

Method: 1) 基于复杂度的分区引擎划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法改进架构设计；3) 零成本预测器避免大量候选架构从头训练。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟比基线降低达54%，搜索成本从数天降至数分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过分区搜索空间和协同进化策略有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题，在精度和延迟权衡方面表现出色，显著降低了搜索成本。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于密度比加权的行为克隆方法，使用小规模清洁参考集通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，在行为克隆目标中加权以优先处理清洁专家行为，降低污染数据影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常受到对抗性污染、系统错误或低质量样本的影响，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降。需要一种不依赖污染机制知识的鲁棒模仿学习方法。

Method: 使用小规模清洁参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，对密度比进行裁剪后作为权重用于行为克隆目标，优先学习清洁专家行为，降低污染数据权重。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下也能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。建立了包含多种污染协议的综合评估框架。

Conclusion: Weighted BC方法能够有效处理污染数据集，理论保证收敛到清洁专家策略，且有限样本界限与污染率无关，在现实应用中具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出攻击可转移性的关键区别：输入数据空间的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间的攻击不能转移（除非表示几何对齐）。通过理论证明和四个实验验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在模型间转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移，揭示攻击可转移性的根本原因。

Method: 1. 在简单网络设置中数学证明该区别；2. 构建针对图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3. 构建针对语言模型的表示空间越狱攻击；4. 构建针对视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击并测试可转移性。

Result: 表示空间攻击虽然能成功攻击目标模型，但无法转移到其他模型；数据空间攻击能够成功转移；当视觉语言模型的潜在几何在投影后空间中对齐时，表示空间攻击也能转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享的数据空间与模型独特的表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒的模型具有重要启示。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多数投票方法平等对待所有答案，无法考虑模型间的潜在异质性和相关性，需要更有效的聚合方法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊奇流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息进行答案聚合。

Result: 在合成数据集、UltraFeedback、MMLU等LLM微调基准以及ARMMAN医疗场景中，新方法均优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP方法在理论和实践上都优于多数投票，为构建鲁棒的多智能体LLM管道提供了实用性能和概念见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱基础模型中的确定性等变性限制了模型表达能力，使其无法区分结构相似但语义不同的关系，这阻碍了模型在零样本链接预测任务中的性能。

Method: 提出了概率性节点-关系等变性，在保持分布等变性的同时引入原则性随机化来打破推理过程中的对称性。Flock模型通过迭代采样随机游走、编码序列、序列建模和池化聚合来学习节点和关系的表示。

Conclusion: 概率性节点-关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的关键，Flock模型证明了该方法的有效性，能够泛化到新颖实体和关系上。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个预测框架，使用FDA兽医药物不良事件报告数据，通过机器学习模型预测动物用药后的死亡与恢复结果，旨在提高兽医药物安全性和食品安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护动物福利和人类食品安全需要确保食品生产动物用药的安全性，不良事件可能预示着意外的药代动力学或毒代动力学效应，增加食品链中违规残留的风险。

Method: 使用FDA OpenFDA兽医医学中心的约128万份报告，建立预处理流程整合关系表并通过VeDDRA本体标准化不良事件。评估了多种监督学习模型，包括随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost、ExcelFormer和大语言模型，采用集成方法和基于平均不确定性边际的伪标记技术。

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球范围内实现零样本预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三大局限：需要特定电网的电力结构数据、依赖单独的电网特定模型难以实现全球覆盖、缺乏不确定性估计限制了碳感知应用的可靠性。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，支持零样本预测和插补任务，并提供95%覆盖率的预测区间。

Result: 在全球214个电网实现零样本预测MAPE为15.82%；在13个基准电网平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%；可提供长达21天的预测且精度下降最小；完全微调后在插补任务上比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX能在数据有限的情况下轻松应用于任何电网并提供强大性能，是实用的全球规模脱碳工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种改进二值神经网络验证的整数规划方法：新的线性目标函数生成方法和基于递归结构的有效不等式技术，显著提高了验证效率和扰动范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络验证的自然整数规划公式存在大M约束导致的积分间隙问题，难以有效求解，需要改进IP公式来提高验证能力。

Method: 1) 为多分类设置引入新的线性目标函数生成方法；2) 利用BNN递归结构生成有效不等式的技术来改进IP公式。

Result: 相比现有IP方法，在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 提出的两种技术显著改善了BNN验证的IP公式，提高了验证效率和能力。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

TL;DR: 提出了Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过使用往返转换成功作为奖励信号来训练模型提高一致性，显著提升了化学大语言模型的性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型缺乏往返一致性，例如能成功描述分子结构却无法从自己生成的文本准确重建原始结构，这表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。往返一致性与主要任务性能强相关，因此将一致性作为直接优化目标。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用往返转换成功作为奖励信号训练模型。提出迭代变体，前向和反向映射交替训练形成自改进循环，在化学领域大量无标签数据下特别有效。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下均显著提升了性能和一致性，优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 往返一致性不仅是理想特性，而且是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法，能够绕过大型语言模型的提示防护机制，成功越狱多个主流生产模型，揭示了轻量级提示防护的固有漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。轻量级提示防护机制因其易于实现和更新而流行，但本文旨在揭示这类防护的局限性。

Method: 利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够理解的越狱提示。

Result: 该方法成功越狱了Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口，同时保持了响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了轻量级提示防护在现代LLM架构中的固有攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出，并识别了其他关键对齐问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Motivation: 6G需要将数字信号处理和机器学习无缝集成到蜂窝网络软件栈中，使现代网络生命周期更接近AI系统，实现模型和算法在相邻环境中的迭代训练、仿真和部署。

Conclusion: 该框架是实现原生智能6G网络愿景的关键，为AI/ML模型在下一代蜂窝系统中的集成提供了基础支持。

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

TL;DR: TSci是首个基于LLM的智能代理框架，用于通用时间序列预测，通过四个专业代理（数据管理、规划、预测、报告）实现自动化预测流程，在8个基准测试中显著优于统计和LLM基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统时间序列预测中需要大量人工预处理、验证和集成的问题，开发一个通用、领域无关且最小化人工干预的框架。

Method: 构建包含四个专业代理的LLM驱动框架：Curator进行数据诊断和预处理，Planner规划模型选择，Forecaster执行模型拟合和验证并选择最佳配置，Reporter生成透明报告。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，TSci平均减少预测误差10.4%（相比统计方法）和38.2%（相比LLM基线），同时生成透明可解释的报告。

Conclusion: TSci成功实现了自动化、可解释的时间序列预测，显著提升预测性能并降低人工成本，为通用时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理时SOTA模型准确率下降25-40%。强化学习相比监督微调能更好地提升模型在代码和数学问题上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的研究往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估模型性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架。

Method: 提出可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整的三个推理步骤。使用监督微调和强化学习进行模型训练，并测试在域外任务上的泛化能力。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理时准确率下降25-40%。强化学习在代码任务上带来1.5-2倍改进，并能泛化到数学问题，而监督微调在域外任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效诱导核心认知行为并实现跨领域泛化，为提升LLM反事实推理能力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有交互模仿学习方法仅修正当前状态动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作，需要更有效利用人类干预信号。

Method: PPL将每次人类干预引导到L个未来时间步（偏好范围），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，通过偏好优化在预测的未来状态上传播专家修正。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性，显著提高学习效率并减少人类演示需求。

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好范围L能在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过引入图像空间的KL代理约束来防止奖励黑客问题，在保持提示一致性的同时提升奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学分数）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高分数但偏离原始提示的图像。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理正则化，约束采样轨迹以防止奖励黑客。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间，适用于不可微分奖励。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励函数和公开数据集上，MIRA相比基线方法获得了超过60%的胜率，同时保持了提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA提供了一种有效的推理时对齐方法，能够在不进行微调的情况下提升奖励分数，同时防止奖励黑客问题，适用于各种扩散模型和奖励函数。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的理论正确实现，而'k3 as loss'只是有偏的一阶近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLHF方法中KL散度正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法基于数值估计原则而非优化损失的功能角色，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略得分函数的分离系数（'kn in reward'）或作为直接传播梯度的损失函数（'kn as loss'），证明两者在梯度上的等价性。

Result: 证明在on-policy条件下，'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价，都是RKL目标的正确实现；而'k3 as loss'只是有偏的一阶近似；同时指出off-policy实现因忽略重要性采样而存在偏差。

Conclusion: 提供了基于梯度的KL正则化选择和正确实现的理论依据，为构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

TL;DR: 提出了IBCD（干预贝叶斯因果发现）框架，利用干预数据进行因果发现，通过建模总因果效应矩阵的似然，结合尖峰-平板马蹄先验和数据驱动的网络结构权重，实现不确定性感知的因果图推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在大规模任务上性能较差且无法量化不确定性，而高通量基因组扰动数据为改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然（近似矩阵正态分布），使用尖峰-平板马蹄先验对边进行建模，从观测数据中分别学习无标度和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性推理。

Result: 通过广泛模拟实验，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法；应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，边后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中实现了优越的结构恢复性能，并能通过后验概率量化不确定性，为大规模因果推断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

TL;DR: TetriServe是一个针对Diffusion Transformer模型的动态并行服务系统，通过步骤级序列并行和轮次调度机制，在保证图像质量的同时显著提升服务级别目标达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，无法有效处理混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载，导致GPU利用率低和SLO达成率差。

Method: 提出步骤级序列并行策略，动态调整单个请求的并行度；设计TetriServe系统，采用轮次调度机制，包括时间离散化、步骤级并行度适应和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度策略有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务效率问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习（RL）与蛋白质语言模型（PLM）结合在蛋白质设计中的效果，发现RL能提升采样效率和成功率，但效果取决于任务空间、奖励准确性和策略容量三个因素的交互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习是否能推动蛋白质语言模型超越其预训练先验，揭示潜在的序列-结构-功能规则，这是监督学习无法捕捉的能力。

Method: 在四个蛋白质设计领域（抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和反向折叠）中，使用多种RL算法和模型类别，将RL与PLM配对进行实验。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中一致提高了成功率和采样效率。性能提升遵循三因素交互：任务空间、奖励保真度和策略容量共同决定增益。当奖励准确且信息丰富、策略容量足够、任务有超越监督基线的空间时，改进会扩展；当奖励有噪声或容量受限时，增益会饱和。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL提供了实用指导：在扩展策略规模之前优先考虑奖励建模和校准，将算法和正则化强度与任务难度匹配，并将容量分配到边际收益最大的地方。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布的动态特性，限制了深度学习训练的优化效果。

Method: SPAMP框架通过跟踪局部梯度统计、动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换来以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新表述为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP提供了一个原则性的替代方案，能够替代僵化的启发式方法，通过统一的梯度整形框架显著改善深度学习训练性能。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自注意力机制识别推理轨迹中的重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时根据问题难度调整推理预算，实现自适应思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型在复杂推理任务中面临思考不足（underthinking）导致错误和过度思考（overthinking）导致效率低下的问题，需要自适应调整推理长度以适应不同难度的问题。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力来识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计问题难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习分配与问题难度相称的推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型实现了8.4%的绝对准确率提升和36.8%的推理长度相对减少，相比最佳RL基线实现了7.9%的准确率提升和29.4%的长度减少，并在非数学数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，能够在多样化任务上实现准确率和效率的提升，为模型提供基于难度的细粒度思考预算调整。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

*Youwei Bao,Shuhan Yang,Hyunsoo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用自旋转移矩磁性隧道结(STT-MTJs)生成真随机数，解决生成式AI模型中伪随机数生成器的安全漏洞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测模式，容易受到攻击者利用，而传统防御方法存在显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 通过嵌入硬件生成的真随机比特，构建基于STT-MTJs的高度并行FPGA辅助计算系统，产生通过NIST随机性测试的真随机数。

Result: 系统提供兆比特/秒的真随机数，在CIFAR-10训练的生成对抗网络中，相比低质量随机数生成器基线，不安全输出减少了18.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和可扩展性，有望扩展到10^6个并行单元，实现千兆比特/秒的吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样，突显自旋电子RNG作为下一代GAI系统实用安全组件的潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

TL;DR: 从统计物理学角度分析VAE中的后验坍塌现象，揭示其是由数据结构和模型超参数共同控制的相变过程，并确定了临界超参数阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，传统观点认为这是优化失败，但本文从统计物理学角度重新审视这一问题。

Method: 通过分析后验坍塌相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现后验坍塌是一个相变过程，临界边界由KL散度的不连续性表征，将有意义潜在推断与坍塌状态分开。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌不是单纯的优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的涌现相变，为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

*Feiyang Kang,Michael Kuchnik,Karthik Padthe,Marin Vlastelica,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu,Newsha Ardalani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT（监督微调）的高分并不总能转化为RL（强化学习）后的性能提升，甚至可能比基模型直接RL效果更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前实践中将SFT和RL作为两个独立阶段的假设，质疑高SFT分数是否能可靠预测RL后的性能提升。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和RLVR（通过GRPO），在7个数学基准上进行多达256次重复的广泛评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用预RL性能预测精度显著提高，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提升高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT性能不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k是更好的替代指标，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究（1000多个LLM，10万+GPU小时）发现：仅使用改写式合成数据预训练不比自然网页数据快；但1/3改写合成数据与2/3自然数据混合可加速5-10倍。纯教科书式合成数据预训练在小型数据预算下损失较高。最佳合成数据比例约为30%，且8B参数生成器模型表现足够好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据对LLM扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，需要系统评估不同合成数据类型的实际效果。

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律进行大规模实证研究，比较自然网页数据、多种合成数据类型（改写文本、生成教科书）以及自然与合成数据的混合。

Result: 改写合成数据单独使用无加速效果，但与自然数据混合可显著加速；教科书式合成数据单独使用性能较差；合成数据最佳比例约30%；8B参数生成器模型足够好；模型坍缩现象在不同合成数据类型中表现不同。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性益处，需要根据数据类型、比例和模型规模进行精心设计，为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

*Ryan Y. Lin,Siddhartha Ojha,Nicholas Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了曲率自适应Transformer（CAT），通过轻量级可微分门控机制动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支间的路由，解决了传统Transformer在非欧几里得数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer隐含假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有扩展到双曲和球面空间的方法需要预先选择单一几何，缺乏处理混合几何特性数据的灵活性。

Method: CAT架构包含三个几何注意力分支（欧几里得、双曲、球面），通过可微分门控机制动态路由每个token到最适合的几何空间。路由网络提供可解释的曲率偏好，每个分支使用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习到的几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展且可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过后生成编辑（如人工修订或欺骗攻击），因此需要检测和定位这些修改。

Method: 采用组合模式水印框架，将词汇表划分为不相交子集，在生成过程中强制确定性组合模式嵌入水印，并设计轻量级局部统计量来标记和定位潜在编辑。

Result: 在开源LLM上对各种编辑场景进行评估，展示了在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合模式水印框架能够有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

TL;DR: 提出了支持基分解框架，用于高效近似注意力机制，突破了传统有界条目假设的限制，实现了次二次时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软注意力机制的二次复杂度是大语言模型扩展的主要瓶颈，现有次二次近似算法需要限制性的有界条目假设，这在实践中很少成立。

Method: 利用查询和键矩阵条目具有次高斯行为的特性，通过支持基分解将大条目和小条目分离，对稀疏组件进行精确计算，对密集组件进行多项式近似。

Result: 建立了严格的理论保证，证明了次二次运行时间，并在多阈值设置中消除了所有分布假设，为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论依据。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效注意力近似提供了新框架，突破了传统限制，为软注意力机制的多项式近似提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Result: 该方法在数值研究中显著优于现有方法，即使现有方法可以访问源域样本。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法在无源域样本的情况下实现了有效的跨域持续学习，解决了领域偏移、噪声伪标签和灾难性遗忘等问题。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在达到50-60%稀疏度后难以进一步提升，且会严重降低模型精度，需要突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决现有方法依赖代理目标函数的局限性，并提出量化变体Elsa-L以扩展到超大规模模型。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上达到90%稀疏度时，困惑度比现有最佳方法低7.8倍；Elsa-L可扩展到27B规模模型，并具有理论收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该方法在大语言模型稀疏化方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在有限探索方向上仍有显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

<details>

Motivation: 传统RL4LLM方法避免使用显式评论家，因为传统价值函数在大模型规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。

Method: 使用一组轻量级迷你评论家，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练，通过评论家间不确定性来优化策略更新：屏蔽评论家一致状态的优势值，过滤高分歧状态避免虚假探索。

Result: 在仅有5000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，在Qwen3-4b-Base上比经典PPO提升超过6%，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上提升约3%。

Conclusion: 架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO证明了在大模型设置下恢复评论家角色的可行性。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在学习强健的时间序列表示，通过有效平衡嵌入空间中的均匀性和容忍度特性，以更好地捕捉时间序列中的实例级和时间依赖性信息。

Method: 采用分层设置学习实例级和时间信息，集成温度调度器到对比损失中，并使用层次化角度边界损失来增强正负对之间的几何边界。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上的分类任务中显著优于先前方法，在异常检测任务上获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡机制有效提升了时间序列表示学习的性能，特别是在分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示，但其架构对传统剪枝方法构成挑战，特别是基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感，导致重要性评估不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以移位不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapKAN能保持真实节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提升了KAN的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: AGFN通过学习更广泛的特征分布增强泛化能力，通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，降低对特定位置的依赖，从而创建更鲁棒的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

*Juncheng Dong,Weibin Mo,Zhengling Qi,Cong Shi,Ethan X. Fang,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个悲观的品类优化框架（PASTA），用于在数据覆盖不足的情况下解决离线品类优化问题，并在多种选择模型下实现了最优的期望收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线数据驱动的品类优化中，由于组合性质导致数据覆盖不足，传统方法难以设计出具有理论保证的有效解决方案。

Method: 引入悲观品类优化（PASTA）框架，利用悲观原则，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优品类，而不需要覆盖所有可行品类。

Result: 为多项logit和嵌套logit等广泛使用的选择模型建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面的极小极大最优性。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在理论和实验上都优于现有基线方法，为离线品类优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层最优传输（HOT）框架，解决标准表示相似性方法在神经网络对齐中的局限性，能够处理不同深度网络的对齐问题，提供全局对齐分数和软传输计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准表示相似性方法存在不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度网络的问题，这些限制源于忽略了全局激活结构和限制映射为刚性的一对一层对应关系。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层之间分配质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，揭示了平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiNet模型结合隐马尔可夫模型在手腕加速度计数据上实现了优于传统随机森林+HMM的活动强度分类性能，适用于大规模流行病学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于手腕加速度计数据的大规模流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人类活动识别模型来研究体力活动与健康结果之间的关联。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（自监督的18层改进ResNet-V2模型），然后应用隐马尔可夫模型平滑来分类活动强度标签。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏F1分数为0.82，Cohen's kappa分数为0.86，优于RF+HMM模型的0.77和0.81，且在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果鼓励在未来的流行病学研究中使用ActiNet模型从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是首个无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化如FlashAttention主要关注系统级I/O优化，缺乏数学保证的无损加速方法。

Method: 基于基础分解(BD)的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备即可应用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，BDA实现32%更快的键/值投影和25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性，在总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证局限于表格MDP或需要限制性折扣因子假设，缺乏在函数逼近下的理论保证，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，无需模型或生成器访问MDP，支持总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集。

Result: 建立了Õ(1/ε²)的样本复杂度以获得ε-准确值估计，填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与非鲁棒对应物理论保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法成功将鲁棒TD学习扩展到函数逼近场景，关键思想也可直接扩展到鲁棒Q学习，为鲁棒RL提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个人决策过程方面存在挑战，需要更有效的方法来理解工作地点选择的复杂决策模式。

Method: 使用深度神经网络(DNN)方法建模工作地点选择决策，并与传统离散选择模型(DCM)进行对比分析。

Result: DNN在多个方面优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合。DCM在短距离表现更佳，而DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型应根据具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，需要基于特定要求进行选择。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

Motivation: 研究DPSGD训练神经网络对模型公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能达到与非隐私模型相当的公平性水平。

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异性影响，并在广泛的超参数设置范围内进行分析，同时评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体的效果。

Result: 发现不同性能指标的差异性影响并不一致，直接优化超参数不能可靠减轻DPSGD的不公平影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt在超参数选择方面不够稳健。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间仔细权衡；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是改善效用-公平性权衡的有效方法，但不能完全解决DPSGD的不公平问题。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声和无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力，需要一种方法来识别和移除这些干扰信息。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择框架，针对每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导性或冗余信息，仅保留最相关特征构建潜在空间。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择方法能有效增强潜在表示，提升模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Conclusion: 成功识别并解决了结合势能架构和退化变分积分器时的数值不稳定问题，提出的训练策略能够有效学习非规范哈密顿动力学。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Result: 当前过滤器仅对真实图像具有高灵敏度，但特异性有限且一致性不足，无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键局限性，在敏感应用中部署前需要过滤器设计的实质性改进。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出稀疏查询注意力(SQA)机制，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力(MHA)的二次计算复杂度限制了长序列处理能力，现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少FLOPs计算量。

Method: 通过减少查询头数量而非键值头来降低注意力计算复杂度，提出SQA架构及其变体家族。

Result: 在32k-200k长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算密集型场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA是构建更高效可扩展模型的强大工具，可作为现有注意力优化方法的补充路径。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

*Olivier Goudet,Quentin Suire,Adrien Goëffon,Frédéric Saubion,Sylvain Lamprier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种顺序不变强化学习框架用于黑盒组合优化，通过随机生成顺序训练自回归生成模型，提高搜索空间多样性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练时随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 该顺序不变强化学习框架在组合优化中表现出色，通过促进搜索空间多样性和关注相关变量依赖，提高了样本效率和性能稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Motivation: 现有的AutoML方法依赖耗尽的超参数搜索，而预选预测作为一种有前景的替代方案在文献中尚未充分探索，旨在通过智能预选模型来绕过这种搜索。

Method: 利用传统模型和大型语言模型(LLM)智能体，基于数据集描述和统计信息来减少AutoML库的搜索空间，并在AWS AutoGluon组合数据集上进行应用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为AutoML工作流程提供了转变，通过预选模型显著减少计算负担，同时保持模型选择性能。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Motivation: 在形式验证领域，表示学习尚未得到充分探索，而深度学习在安全关键系统验证中已显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标，学到的表示能有效迁移到下游任务并泛化到更复杂的公式。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Motivation: 对称性在等变网络设计和控制方程发现中广泛应用，但在复杂场景中对称性未知。现有方法大多局限于线性对称性，非线性对称性发现方法未能显式获得李代数子空间。

Method: 指定无穷小群作用的函数库，求解其系数矩阵。证明微分方程的延拓公式对系数矩阵也是线性的。通过数据中心差分和神经网络雅可比矩阵代入无穷小准则，得到系数矩阵的线性方程组，用SVD求解。

Result: 在顶夸克标记和一系列动态系统上，LieNLSD显示出比现有方法质的优势，将神经PDE求解器的长程滚转精度提高了20%以上，同时指导数据增强。

Conclusion: LieNLSD是首个能够确定非线性项无穷小生成元数量及其显式表达式的方法，在复杂对称性发现方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Method: 学习一个生成模型来捕获任务族共享的基础组件及其统计信息，将新任务学习转化为概率推断问题。

Result: 模型成功恢复了规则学习和运动学习任务中的真实组件和统计信息，并能从单个示例快速推断新解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表现力和概率推断的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习。

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint
functions need not contain any common feasible point. The results are
established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了梯度空间的动态特性，发现虽然小部分子空间捕获了大部分梯度能量，但仍有显著部分存在于残差空间中，且核心子空间的影响随时间推移和层深加深而减弱。基于这些洞察，作者提出了GrassWalk和GrassJump随机算法，在LLaMA-1B和LLaMA-7B预训练中实现了最先进的内存节省和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型常受限于极端内存需求，其中优化器状态占主导地位。现有工作通过将梯度投影到低维子空间来缓解这一成本，但需要更深入理解梯度空间动态特性。

Method: 分析梯度空间及其子空间的动态特性，发现梯度空间具有近似平坦的曲率。基于这些洞察，提出了GrassWalk和GrassJump随机算法，利用子空间特性进行优化。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B和LLaMA-7B预训练中，实现了最先进的内存节省，同时提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了子空间动态特性的重要性，提出的随机算法有效利用了这些特性，为大型语言模型训练提供了高效的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程（如细胞分化或疾病进展）只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化以揭示动态特性对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在高维情况下扩展性差且需要严格假设。

Method: 扩展了扩散Schrödinger桥匹配的理论保证和实证效率，推导出迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，以新颖的因子化方式处理多个边际。

Result: 在玩具示例上保留了理论特性，在真实世界数据集（如100维转录组轨迹推断）上达到最先进性能，首次在非常高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥是恢复静态数据中隐藏动态的实用且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

Motivation: 传统诊断模型通常单独分析不同医疗数据源，限制了发现跨模态关联的能力，而这些关联对早期疾病诊断至关重要。

Method: 使用注意力变换器框架，首先通过专用编码器将各模态数据映射到共享潜在空间，然后使用多头注意力和残差归一化进行融合，支持多任务预训练和轻松适应新疾病。

Conclusion: 该模型朝着精准诊断的统一基础模型发展，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的机器学习范式，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在复杂大规模图像分类任务中的适用性，同时保持其固有的可解释性优势。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%的准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56%的F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中表现优异，同时保持了可解释性，这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将此类模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RoGRAD框架，通过检索增强生成和迭代图对比学习来解决图神经网络在缺陷图数据上的性能问题，相比传统方法和LLM增强方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对传统方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强方法是否始终优于传统方法尚不明确。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术注入基于检索的增强，通过迭代图对比学习生成类别一致且多样化的增强数据，实现从静态信号注入到动态精炼的转变。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中表现出色，相比传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均改进达到82.43%。

Conclusion: RoGRAD是首个迭代式LLM增强图学习框架，通过动态精炼机制显著提升了图神经网络在缺陷图数据上的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适配(LoRA)方法在性能上仍落后于完全微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 使用三因子分解U、S、V⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法能够有效学习子空间，同时与现有微调流程保持兼容，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Conclusion: 提出的重构方法能够有效计算对抗风险的尖锐下界，并为超越0-1损失设置的鲁棒分类器设计提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文将传统的后处理模型校准方法（如直方图分箱和温度缩放）引入联邦学习环境，提出了在强客户端异构性下的联邦校准方法，并在联邦学习和差分隐私设置下评估了校准性能。

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

TL;DR: PepCompass是一个几何感知的肽探索和优化框架，通过定义解码器诱导的黎曼流形家族来捕捉局部几何结构，提出了局部探索方法和优化算法，在体外验证中发现了25种高活性抗菌肽。

Conclusion: 几何信息探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GraphNC框架，通过异常分数分布对齐和基于扰动的正态性正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，提高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误检率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA)和基于扰动的正态性正则化(NormReg)。ScoreDA通过将模型异常分数与教师模型分数分布对齐来优化分数；NormReg通过在标注节点上最小化扰动引导的一致性损失来正则化表示空间的正态性。

Result: 该方法能够将正常和异常类别的异常分数推向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数，同时使正常节点的表示更加紧凑。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间中校准正态性，有效克服了现有方法的局限性，提高了图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: 单一流模型在不同分布上表现不一致，需要更稳健的变分推断方法。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）顺序专家训练单个流；2）通过似然驱动的自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构改变。

Result: 在六个典型后验分布上，AMF-VI实现了比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2和MMD指标上获得稳定增益。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验族的稳健变分推断提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

Conclusion: PENEX有潜力作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，用于深度神经网络的有效训练和微调。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

### [207] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，用于在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，通过集成多种阈值估计方法显著降低方差，在数千万几何对数据上实现亚百分位方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确控制召回率至关重要，因为遗漏少数真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度人工审核则会增加成本。传统置信区间方法存在过度估计和高方差问题。

Method: 采用端到端框架：首先通过等距网格边界框过滤和CSR候选表示减少对枚举；使用确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经排序器；通过单次前向传播传播分数；构建可重现的分层校准集；集成四种阈值估计方法并通过逆方差加权融合。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了精确的召回控制，显著降低了阈值方差，为大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

*Samhita Pal,James O'quinn,Kaveh Aryan,Heather Pua,James P. Long,Amir Asiaee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DECOR是一种用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，能够同时学习有向无环图和相关噪声模型，在存在潜在混杂的情况下实现结构学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂方法依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混杂的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR估计器，使用基于似然的完全可微分方法，交替执行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含bow互补性惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别在混杂不普遍时表现出鲁棒性，在普遍混杂下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混杂的线性高斯SEMs提供了一种有效的联合学习方法，理论保证了在bow-free图和均匀特征值边界条件下的全局参数可识别性。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Conclusion: 该生成建模框架为加速发现新型高效催化剂提供了有前景的途径，未来将扩展到氧析出反应和更广泛的材料搜索空间。

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

*Jianing Qi,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将扩散模型中的分类器无关引导方法扩展到经典策略梯度方法，提出策略梯度引导(PGG)，通过调节条件分支和无条件分支的插值来在测试时控制行为，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导技术引入强化学习领域，实现策略的可控性调节，为在线强化学习开辟新的研究方向。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支来构建引导策略梯度更新，在优势估计下归一化项消失。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件丢弃在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能持续改善稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导技术可成功应用于标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了动作触发稀疏可追踪马尔可夫决策过程（ATST-MDPs）框架，针对状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，开发了ST-LSVI-UCB算法并证明了其理论性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常遇到状态观测由动作随机触发的情况，传统强化学习假设每个时间步都能获得状态观测，这限制了方法在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了动作序列学习范式，智能体承诺执行一系列动作直到下一次观测到达；在线性MDP假设下，价值函数在诱导的动作序列特征映射中具有线性表示；开发了具有统计误差保证的离策略估计器。

Result: 提出的ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在稀疏、动作触发的观测条件下学习建立了理论基础，并证明了在这种观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在真实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，填补了金融领域动态交易评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和高风险决策具有直接相关性但尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建多个月股票交易环境，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），并做出连续的买入、卖出或持有决策，使用金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型展现出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 在静态金融知识任务中表现出色不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源支持可重复性和该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Motivation: 传统SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关

Result: 理论证明fSGLD的平稳测度集中在Hessian迹正则化损失函数的全局极小值附近，实验显示在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中达到优越泛化性能

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，在保持计算效率的同时提升泛化和鲁棒性

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Result: 在BabyAI和AndroidWorld基准测试中高效学习高精度奖励，在复杂多任务设置中表现良好，产生的奖励能训练出强大策略。

Conclusion: GRACE能够生成可检查验证的代码奖励函数，在多任务设置中构建复杂奖励API，优于模仿学习和在线强化学习方法。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定。虽然先前工作强调了重用过去经验的好处，但经验特性在大型推理模型学习动态中的作用仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架：识别推理经验价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先利用有价值的经验，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均比在线策略RLVR提升+3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上都能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性的经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过系统化经验利用显著提升了推理性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层和池化操作替代自注意力机制，解决了长序列处理中的二次复杂度问题，在音频处理任务中表现优于现有先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列处理中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在实际应用中的实用性。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 使用循环层替代自注意力，引入池化操作减少序列长度。模型采用递归定义的SkipBlocks结构，包含残差块、下采样池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上采样池化层和额外残差块。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练，改善感知指标（FID和IS），防止过拟合。在原始音频处理任务中优于SaShiMi和Mamba等先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案，深层处理长程依赖，浅层处理短期特征。未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态应用。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: 提出DialTree-RPO框架，通过强化学习和树搜索自动发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，在10个目标模型上比现有方法攻击成功率提高25.9%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法主要依赖人工红队测试或预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间，而研究发现多轮攻击比单轮攻击更有效。

Method: 采用基于策略的强化学习框架结合树搜索，将对话视为顺序决策问题，无需人工标注数据，通过系统探索学习最优对话策略来最大化多轮攻击成功率。

Result: 在10个目标模型上，攻击成功率比现有最优方法提高25.9%以上，并有效发现了新的攻击策略。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提高攻击成功率，为AI安全研究提供了有效的自动化测试工具。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练扩散大语言模型时存在似然计算困难的问题，且缺乏对推理效率的优化。需要开发既能提升推理质量又能加速推理的联合训练方法。

Method: 1. 使用离策略强化学习训练代理策略，提出两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正；2. 联合训练高效采样器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，利用多token预测能力。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上，相比仅训练模型的方法，DiFFPO以更少的函数评估次数获得更好的准确率，在推理计算帕累托前沿上取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: DiFFPO通过强化学习和联合采样器训练，有效提升了扩散大语言模型的推理质量和效率，为推理计算优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Interactive Training框架，允许在神经网络训练过程中进行实时反馈驱动的干预，通过控制服务器实现用户或AI代理与训练过程的动态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练遵循固定的优化策略，缺乏动态响应训练不稳定或问题的灵活性。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为中介，允许用户或AI代理动态调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究表明，该方法实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定问题和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出C2AL方法，通过分析数据子结构和利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，解决推荐模型中用户群体异质性导致的分布不平衡问题，提升对少数群体的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据由异质用户群体组成，但大规模推荐模型在单一全局目标下训练会假设用户同质性，导致模型被中心分布模式主导，忽视头部和尾部区域，限制了模型学习能力并可能产生不活跃的注意力权重或死亡神经元。

Method: 利用注意力机制在因子分解机中进行共享嵌入选择，通过分析数据集子结构并暴露具有强分布对比的子结构进行辅助学习。使用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上对六个SOTA模型进行评估，因子分解机能够使用所提方法捕获细粒度用户-广告交互，总体归一化熵降低0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过利用注意力机制和辅助学习有效解决了推荐模型中的分布不平衡问题，在保持全局性能的同时显著提升了对少数群体的建模效果。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成插值方法在实证中表现出色，但对其如何捕捉缺失值与观测值之间复杂时空依赖关系的理论理解有限，需要研究其统计效率并量化不确定性。

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，而非完整的联合预测分布。生成具有现实相关结构的预测样本路径通常需要昂贵的自回归采样。

Method: 采用copula方法，通过一次前向传递从现有的多步时间序列基础模型生成相关的样本路径。

Result: copula方法比自回归采样快几个数量级，并通过减轻累积误差现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效生成准确的、相关的样本路径，解决了现有模型只能预测独立边际分布的问题。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer和xLSTM的缩放规律，发现在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer更具优势，且随着上下文长度增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持竞争力的同时具有线性复杂度。需要研究不同架构的缩放行为来指导未来模型设计和部署。

Method: 使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法，在80M-7B模型规模和2B-2T训练token范围内，研究xLSTM在计算最优和过训练状态下的缩放行为；分析最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；分析推理时的缩放特性。

Result: xLSTM在典型LLM训练和推理场景中比Transformer缩放更有利，且随着训练和推理上下文增长，xLSTM的优势进一步扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在缩放性能上优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中表现更佳，这为未来模型架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

TL;DR: 提出PUL-Inter-Slice Defender解决方案，使用正未标记学习和LSTM自编码器结合K-Means聚类，保护5G网络切片免受分布式切片移动攻击，在10%-40%攻击污染的训练数据上达到超过98.50%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性引入了分布式切片移动攻击的漏洞，这是一种分布式拒绝服务攻击形式，需要保护5G网络切片安全。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能够有效检测分布式切片移动攻击，在存在污染训练数据的情况下保持鲁棒性，为5G网络切片安全提供了有效的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

TL;DR: 提出Drop-Muon方法，挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的做法，通过随机选择部分层进行更新，结合渐进式训练和非欧几里得更新，实现更高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法每步更新所有层，但作者认为这可能不是最优策略。他们挑战这一假设，旨在开发更高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出Drop-Muon框架，每步随机选择部分层进行更新，结合渐进式训练和层特定的非欧几里得更新。

Result: 理论分析证明全网络更新只有在特定条件下才是最优的。实验显示Drop-Muon比全网络Muon快1.4倍达到相同准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作挑战了深度学习优化的现状，为大规模模型训练提供了理论依据充分的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

TL;DR: 本文研究了纯Transformer架构在分子建模中的潜力，发现无需预定义图结构或物理先验，Transformer就能在分子能量和力预测任务上达到与最先进GNN相当的性能，并能自适应学习物理一致性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在分子建模中依赖预定义的图结构（如固定半径截断或k近邻），这种硬编码的图结构限制了模型表达能力，且稀疏图操作会减慢推理速度。本文旨在探索纯Transformer是否能在没有图结构先验的情况下有效建模分子系统。

Method: 使用未经修改的标准Transformer架构，直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，不引入预定义的图结构或物理先验。在OMol25数据集上与最先进的等变GNN在相同训练计算预算下进行对比。

Result: Transformer在能量和力预测任务上达到了与最先进GNN相当的MAE性能。模型自适应地学习了物理一致性模式，如注意力权重随原子间距离反比衰减，并能根据不同分子环境灵活调整这些模式。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的许多有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Result: 强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态反应式干扰的有效方法，能够自适应地优化传输性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为环境理解和无线应用提供了更准确高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

*Runqian Wang,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Equilibrium Matching (EqM)生成建模框架，通过平衡动力学视角学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，采用基于优化的采样过程，在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID，并能处理去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散和基于流的生成模型使用非平衡、时间条件动力学，EqM旨在通过平衡动力学视角改进这一方法，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度。

Method: EqM丢弃传统模型中的非平衡时间条件动力学，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度。在推理时采用基于优化的采样过程，通过梯度下降在学习的景观上进行采样，支持可调步长、自适应优化器和自适应计算。

Result: EqM在生成性能上超越扩散/流模型，在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID。此外，还能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过用统一的平衡景观替代时间条件速度，在流模型和能量基模型之间建立了更紧密的桥梁，为优化驱动的推理提供了简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了扩散模型成功背后的机制，基于流形假设，认为扩散模型能够适应数据中的低维几何结构。通过研究分数匹配目标中隐式正则化的作用，证明了平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的平滑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在各种领域表现出卓越的泛化能力，但其成功机制尚未完全理解。基于流形假设，研究者推测这种成功源于模型对数据中低维几何结构的适应能力。

Method: 通过研究经验分数匹配目标最小化器的平滑效果，分析隐式正则化的作用。理论分析和实证结果检验了平滑分数函数（或等价地在对数密度域中平滑）的效果。

Result: 研究证实平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。此外，研究表明通过选择适当的平滑方式，可以控制扩散模型泛化所沿的流形。

Conclusion: 该工作为扩散模型成功源于对数据低维几何结构适应的猜想提供了证据，揭示了分数匹配学习问题中隐式正则化的重要作用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型来源和未经授权的蒸馏复制问题，关注模型溯源和知识产权保护。

Method: 模型无关框架，结合无数据输入合成和统计分数计算进行蒸馏检测，适用于分类和生成模型。

Result: 在图像分类和文生图任务上显著提升检测准确率：CIFAR-10提高59.6%，ImageNet提高71.2%，文生图提高20.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效检测知识蒸馏，为模型溯源提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

*Dhruv Kohli,Sawyer J. Robertson,Gal Mishne,Alexander Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的全局结构来指导局部切空间估计，解决了LPCA在高噪声环境下邻域大小选择的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法LPCA在高噪声设置中表现不佳，因为邻域大小的选择存在关键权衡，而选择最优大小需要先验的几何和噪声知识，这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构而非仅依赖局部邻域。

Result: 实验表明LEGO产生的切空间估计比LPCA对噪声更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部内在维度估计等下游任务中显著改进。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的全局信息，提供了更鲁棒的切空间估计，克服了LPCA在高噪声环境中的局限性。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜推理学生模型，解决了显式思维链推理的计算成本高和潜推理缺乏监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且包含冗余信息，而潜推理缺乏有效监督，在复杂自然语言推理中效果有限。

Method: 使用自蒸馏方法，将教师模型压缩KV缓存中的知识蒸馏到潜推理学生模型，利用连续潜标记的表示灵活性对齐逐步KV轨迹。

Result: 方法在潜推理基准上表现优于强基线，从方程到自然语言轨迹的退化显著减小，能扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了思维链训练的准确性和潜推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer

three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a

<details>

Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算成本过高难以快速适应。日常社交互动往往遵循可预测的模式（脚本），这些模式能最小化认知负荷。

Method: 将行为建模为计算机程序而非基于信念和欲望的策略。ROTE算法利用LLM合成行为程序的假设空间，并使用概率推理处理该空间的不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大规模家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE在稀疏观测条件下预测人类和AI行为，比行为克隆和LLM方法在样本内准确性和样本外泛化能力上提升高达50%。

Conclusion: 将动作理解视为程序合成问题，为AI系统在现实世界中高效有效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Method: 集成领域特定知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体，构建CA-ChemE系统，通过多智能体协作实现自主研究进化。

Result: 知识库增强机制使7个专家智能体的对话质量平均提升10-15%；协作智能体的介入使远领域专家对的协作效率提升8.5%，而近领域对仅提升0.8%，揭示了"知识库差距导致的协作效率递减"效应。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构为化学工程中的自主科学发现提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉LLM智能体在交互环境中涌现的社会和认知动态，如沟通、说服和协作行为，需要新的评估方法来理解智能体行为。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为受控"社会实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种挑战性话题进行辩论，并采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强大的共识寻求倾向，语义一致性高（μ>0.88），角色分配能诱导稳定的心理测量特征，主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体环境的新一代动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Motivation: 奖励攻击（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式攻击会绕过现有的思维链监控。

Method: TRACE方法：逐步截断模型的思维链，强制模型回答，测量每个截断点的验证通过率。攻击模型由于走捷径，只需少量思维链就能获得高通过率。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比最强的72B CoT监控提升超过65%，在编程任务中比32B监控提升超过30%。还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法无效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励攻击。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种将推理时检索转化为学习能力的蒸馏方法，通过从失败中提取提示、生成改进轨迹并训练学生模型，在ALFWorld和WebShop基准上显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的操作、发出冗余命令或处理环境约束不当。检索增强生成(RAG)虽然能提供运行时指导，但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销。

Method: 三步蒸馏流程：1)从代理失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；2)在回合开始时使用这些提示通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；3)在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld上达到91%成功率（基线为79%），WebShop得分提升至72（基线为61），同时比检索增强教师少用10-60%的token。方法在7B/14B参数规模和ReAct/StateAct架构上均有效。

Conclusion: 检索的好处可以通过针对性微调有效内化，无需永久性的运行时依赖，证明了将推理时检索转化为学习能力的可行性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

TL;DR: 提出使用大语言模型(LLM)代理自动化数据驱动建模和分析的管道，特别关注回归任务，在临界热通量预测基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程依赖大量实验和模拟数据，传统数据驱动方法需要大量人工干预，难以扩展和泛化到多样化应用。

Method: 评估两种LLM代理框架：多代理系统（专业协作代理）和单代理系统（基于ReAct范式），自主处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化。

Result: 在约25,000个实验数据点的临界热通量预测基准测试中，LLM代理开发的模型超越传统查找表，预测精度和不确定性量化与专家开发的贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当。

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: OntoLogX是一个基于LLM的自主AI代理，将原始系统日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，并通过RAG和迭代校正确保图谱质量，最终映射到MITRE ATT&CK战术框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是重要的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构、语义不一致和分散性，其利用价值受限。需要能够将噪声异构数据整合为连贯可互操作表示的方法。

Method: 结合轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱语法和语义有效。系统还会话级聚合知识图谱，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，系统能够跨多个知识图谱后端稳健生成图谱，并准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和校正提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 基于本体的表示为可操作的网络威胁情报提取提供了价值，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效，检索和校正机制对精度和召回率有显著益处。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理与轻量级代理模型的协作框架，用于可扩展的知识挖掘，在保持高准确率的同时大幅降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高与传统分类器-提取器管道脆弱且无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行管道，并作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，统一分类和提取为两个原子操作。

Result: Falconer在指令遵循准确率上接近最先进LLM，同时减少推理成本达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了高效且可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Motivation: 当前AI教育社区往往忽视了领域专家精心策划知识在创建有效辅导系统中的作用，本文旨在强调这一被忽视的话题。

Method: 1. 使用可解释AI技术结合专家指定的问题解决规则来自动生成课程；2. 利用专家指定的学习课程体系来开发自适应辅导系统。

Result: 通过传粉者识别辅导系统的案例研究，证明了这些方法的可行性和重要性。

Conclusion: 领域专家的精心策划知识对于创建新颖教育系统至关重要，能够改善学习体验并提高算法效率。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE是一种新颖的强化学习方法，通过将视觉输入视为随机上下文，量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，从而在输入空间而非输出空间进行探索，有效提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态大语言模型时，将视觉输入视为固定确定性条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的不确定性，导致策略对合理视觉变化的鲁棒性不足。

Method: VOGUE方法将图像视为随机上下文，使用对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样策略来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是提升多模态推理的有效方法，VOGUE展示了在输入空间进行探索的优越性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于评估大语言模型在AI法规合规性评估方面性能的基准数据集AIReg-Bench，专注于欧盟AI法案的合规性检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI监管的加强，需要评估LLMs在AI法规合规性评估方面的能力，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试工具。

Method: 通过两步流程创建数据集：1) 使用结构化提示生成120个技术文档片段，描述虚构但合理的AI系统；2) 法律专家审查并标注每个样本是否违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了包含专家标注的合规性评估数据集，并评估了前沿LLMs在重现专家合规标签方面的表现。

Conclusion: AIReg-Bench为理解基于LLM的AI法规合规评估工具的机遇和局限性提供了起点，并为后续LLMs的比较建立了基准。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT通过将搜索前沿分为主线（高效用候选）和侧线（逻辑一致但初始效用低的候选），使用侧向竞速算法来缓解广度饱和和深度短视问题，在大规模测试时计算预算下实现有原则的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准思维树搜索在大计算预算下存在两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度短视（噪声短期效用剪枝长期有回报的分支）。需要一种方法在保持提升纪律的同时将大计算预算转化为有原则的多样性。

Method: 提出侧向思维树（LToT），将前沿分为主线和侧线。侧线使用带短路机制的侧向竞速算法（LR-SC）：通过有限连续减半竞速在宽侧线集上分布微小探测，使用宽度感知阈值和重复确认，一旦分支表现超过主线标准立即提升。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀ log_η N₀)，与未限制主线的指数增长形成对比。实证评估正在准备中。

Conclusion: LToT在不增加计算成本的情况下缓解了饱和和短视问题，将大测试时预算转化为有原则的多样性，同时保持提升纪律。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示机制，通过分析token的转移模式来理解推理过程，并平衡利用已有推理路径与探索新路径之间的关系。

Method: 首先训练稀疏自编码器生成token的稀疏向量表示，然后使用k-means聚类构建token转移图，基于边权重定义奖励函数来量化推理轨迹的遵循程度，同时通过聚类多样性评估探索程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用与探索对数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型来引导生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能够防止极端行为，促进更高质量的推理过程，在LLM数学推理任务中实现了利用与探索的良好平衡。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域如法律和医学中，高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。这些推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编码的前提，由于众多例外涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，单个事实的引入可能使一般规则失效，带来重大挑战。LLMs在处理自然语言方面表现出色，但其标准推理能力无法满足高保证文本指南所需的严格推理。

Method: 提出LOGicalThought (LogT) 神经符号架构，使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双符号图上下文和逻辑上下文，将长文本指南推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中与四个基线对比，LogT在所有LLMs上整体性能提升11.84%。在三种推理模式上性能显著提升：否定推理提升高达+10.2%，蕴含推理提升+13.2%，可废止推理提升+5.5%。

Conclusion: LOGicalThought (LogT) 通过神经符号方法有效解决了高保证文本指南中的严格推理挑战，特别是在处理否定、蕴含和可废止规则等复杂逻辑结构方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理虽然解决了观测不确定性，但往往忽略了内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，这限制了在部分可观测环境中的决策能力。

Method: InfoSeeker提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后再生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在包含不完全观测和不确定动态的部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率，在机器人操作和网页导航等基准测试中也优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于在部分可观测环境中实现鲁棒行为的重要性，InfoSeeker框架能够有效处理观测和环境动态的不确定性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中显著提升性能，增强生成过程的可解释性

Conclusion: 基于理论框架的SAPO算法能有效引导扩散语言模型学习结构化推理，解决现有方法的缺陷

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过预先分析潜在危害及其后果来生成安全输出，在安全性和通用推理能力方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏对潜在风险的系统性考虑。InvThink旨在通过逆向思维让模型在生成响应前主动识别和避免风险。

Method: 1) 枚举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM系列中实现。

Result: 安全改进随模型规模扩展更强；减轻安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）和代理场景中，有害响应减少达15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和通用化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗性多智能体强化学习将安全性内化到任务智能体中，无需外部防护模块即可同时提升安全性和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统面临越狱、提示注入和对抗性协作攻击，现有防御方法存在性能不足或系统开销大的问题。

Method: 使用协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，联合优化攻击者（生成越狱提示）和防御者（任务智能体），引入公共基线估计来稳定学习和促进合作。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法可达38.33%，同时任务准确率保持甚至提升（推理任务提升达3.67%）。

Conclusion: 安全性和实用性可以在不依赖额外防护智能体或增加系统开销的情况下共同提升。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Motivation: 现有交互式对话推荐系统在处理动态用户偏好、保持对话连贯性和平衡多个排序目标方面面临重大挑战，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层智能体网络，包含对话理解、偏好建模、上下文感知和动态排序等专门LLM智能体，通过自适应权重机制协调，结合三层学习策略：简单查询的快速响应、复杂偏好的智能推理和挑战场景的深度协作。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，AgentRec相比最先进基线方法，对话成功率提升2.8%，推荐准确性(NDCG@10)提高1.9%，对话效率提升3.2%，同时通过智能体协调保持可比较的计算成本。

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估LLMs是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的专业知识和资格。

Method: 创建PsychoBench基准，包含约2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家心理咨询师认证考试，要求深入理解并覆盖心理学各子学科。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型得分远超及格线（约70%），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于及格线。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLMs目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这凸显了开发面向心理学的LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的上下文马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)方法，使用LLM压缩高维上下文为低维语义摘要，在多个基准测试中提升奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时降低延迟和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力差，导致计算量过大和性能不稳定，需要一种可扩展的解决方案来处理上下文丰富但资源受限的环境。

Method: 使用信息论摘要方法，通过LLM将上下文输入压缩为低维语义丰富的摘要，这些摘要通过保留决策关键线索同时减少冗余来增强状态表示。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时减少了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的摘要为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否具备理解道路网络地图和进行导航的能力，探索其在真实世界地理空间任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，构建GLOBALTRACE数据集（包含4000多条真实轨迹），使用道路网络作为上下文，通过提示框架让LLMs生成路径而不依赖外部导航工具。

Result: LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成基线和专门模型，展现出强大的零样本泛化能力，对道路网络和坐标系有良好理解，但在区域和交通模式方面存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: 大语言模型具备强大的地理空间推理能力，能够通过灵活的地图推理来增强导航体验并整合用户偏好，展示了在导航任务中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算机使用代理(CUAs)中的盲目标导向(BGD)偏差问题，开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，评估了9个前沿模型并发现高达80.8%的平均BGD率，揭示了即使输入无害时也会出现的微妙风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理(CUAs)在GUI上执行操作以完成用户目标，但存在盲目标导向(BGD)偏差，即不顾可行性、安全性、可靠性或上下文而追求目标，这带来了潜在风险。

Method: 开发BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务捕捉BGD的三种模式：缺乏上下文推理、模糊假设和决策、矛盾或不可行目标。基于OSWorld构建真实环境，使用基于LLM的评估器评估代理行为。

Result: 评估9个前沿模型(包括Claude Sonnet和Opus 4、Computer-Use-Preview、GPT-5)，观察到平均80.8%的高BGD率。基于提示的干预措施降低了BGD水平，但风险依然存在。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和缓解这一基本风险奠定了基础，确保CUA的安全部署。需要更强的训练或推理时干预措施来解决观察到的失败模式。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Result: E5-large-instruct编码器总体准确率0.983，AUC 0.996，仅7个错误，与GPT-4o统计无差异。非生成临床路径每输入消耗约1.0 mWh，比本地8B SLM小170倍，延迟约0.10秒。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过审核的FAQ逐字答案，在临床路径中结构性地避免了前沿判别和生成引起的错误，支持在带宽有限环境中的隐私保护、可持续性和公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖对智能的直觉理解来设计合成任务，这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于数据科学实践的替代设计哲学，专注于评估稳健任务执行能力，通过展示系统可靠部署来证明AGI能力。

Result: 提供了这种新评估哲学的实际应用示例，展示了如何通过稳健任务执行来评估AGI系统。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向基于能力的评估方法，强调系统的可靠部署和实际任务执行能力，而非依赖直觉设计的合成任务。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Motivation: 现有的偏好微调方法忽视了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，需要一种能够产生高质量负样本的方法来改进模型对齐效果。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有目标错误的拒绝响应，保持与接受响应在风格和长度上的相似性，构建了包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集。

Result: 在三个LVLM家族上取得显著性能提升：LLaVA平均提升6.5%，Qwen2VL提升4.0%，Qwen2.5VL提升1.5%，特别是在推理任务上表现突出，同时减少了二元问题中回答"是"的倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好数据中的偏差问题，可推广到开源LLM作为编辑器，数据规模扩展能持续提升性能，为LVLM的对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体AI系统，能够将用户的自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询语言，用于操作代谢组学知识图谱，显著提高了查询准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代谢组学质谱分析产生大量数据，知识图谱虽然能结构化这些数据，但需要深入理解其本体和查询语言语法，这阻碍了研究人员的有效使用。

Method: 设计多智能体系统，使用LangChain和LangGraph库集成LLM与外部工具，通过专门的智能体处理用户查询、验证问题、识别化学转换需求，并生成SPARQL查询。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题上，MetaboT达到83.67%的准确率，而仅使用GPT-4o的基线方法只有8.16%的准确率。

Conclusion: MetaboT成功消除了访问知识图谱的技术障碍，通过自然语言查询实现了结构化代谢组学数据的检索，促进了数据驱动的发现。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between

TL;DR: 提出一个结构化决策支持框架，将不同AI智能体架构与NIST网络安全框架2.0系统对齐，为选择部署AI解决方案应对网络威胁提供透明方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合理论AI构建与运营网络安全需求之间的差距，为符合行业标准的稳健多智能体系统奠定基础。

Method: 通过将NIST CSF 2.0功能细分为具体任务，将AI智能体特性（自主性、自适应学习、实时响应）与安全需求相关联，并定义分级自主级别。

Result: 概念验证表明，定制化AI智能体部署能够与现实约束和风险状况对齐，增强态势感知、加速响应时间并强化长期韧性。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了理论AI构建与运营网络安全需求之间的桥梁，为符合行业标准的稳健多智能体系统提供基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

TL;DR: 提出一个可信赖的协同学习模型，用于军事行动中的人机协作，包含四个维度：可调节自主性、多层控制、双向反馈和协作决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速演变的军事威胁和复杂作战环境中，AI集成带来优势的同时也面临有效和伦理部署的挑战，需要从系统内部动态视角处理多维责任、安全和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 设计包含四个维度的可信赖协同学习模型：可调节自主性（根据任务状态、系统置信度和环境不确定性动态调整自主级别）、多层控制（持续监督、活动监控和问责）、双向反馈（显性和隐性反馈循环确保推理、不确定性和学习适应的沟通）、协作决策（生成、评估和提出带有置信度和理由的决策）。

Result: 提出了一个具体的模型设计，并附有具体示例和建议。

Conclusion: 该模型有助于进一步发展军事行动中负责任和可信赖的人机协作系统。

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的推理过程受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树算法和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将CoT提炼为高层指导进行SFT；2) 引入指导感知RL方法联合优化最终输出和指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B、Qwen3-8B/14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上均取得稳定显著改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能有效提升LLM的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上均表现出良好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

### [276] [Learning a Dense Reasoning Reward Model from Expert Demonstration via Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01857)
*Claudio Fanconi,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对抗性逆强化学习的密集推理奖励模型，用于大语言模型的推理过程监督，通过专家演示学习token级别的奖励函数，在训练时优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者重新排序推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过监督微调模仿专家风格，但无法提供细粒度的推理过程反馈。本文旨在学习能够反映推理正确性而非表面形式的密集奖励函数，以提升多步推理的质量和可解释性。

Method: 采用对抗性逆强化学习框架，从专家演示中学习token级别的密集推理奖励模型。该奖励模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者对采样轨迹进行重新排序。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络验证了：(1)密集推理奖励可作为学习信号激发推理能力；(2)通过奖励引导的重新排序提升了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。奖励分数与最终答案有效性相关，并能定位推理轨迹中的错误。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和token级诊断统一到单一推理奖励中，该方法展示了可重用的过程级奖励在增强语言模型多步推理能力方面的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CARS方法，在保持语言模型分布不变的前提下，通过自适应剪枝技术提高约束生成的采样效率，解决了传统贪婪解码和拒绝采样方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样计算效率低下。在程序模糊测试等需要同时保证样本有效性和多样性的领域，这两种方法都有问题。

Method: CARS方法从无约束采样开始，通过记录约束违反的后续序列到trie结构中，并在未来采样中减去这些序列的概率质量，实现自适应剪枝。

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的LM前向传播次数）和样本多样性方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CARS方法严格提升了拒绝采样的效率而不产生分布扭曲，确保了约束分布下的精确采样，同时单调提高接受率。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在集体决策中与人类社会推理的对齐性，通过Lost at Sea任务比较人类群体与LLM群体的行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是集体层面的对齐，而非个体层面。

Method: 使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验(N=748)，随机分配群体进行领导者选举，比较有可见人口属性与匿名别名的差异，然后模拟匹配的LLM群体进行基准测试。

Result: LLM行为出现分化：一些模型反映人类偏见，另一些则掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏见。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐的AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临投稿量不可管理和AI未受监管的双重危机，需要新的治理模型来保障科学完整性。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准，使得编辑过程不透明且难以审计。

Method: 采用确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标来评估AI生成同行评审报告的可靠性。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决定在所有学科中始终占多数结果(>50%)，'拒绝'率动态适应领域特定规范，在健康科学中升至45%；系统保持稳定的程序完整性，强制执行29%的证据锚定合规率，在不同评审任务和科学领域中保持不变。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施，为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供可扩展的工作流审计、完整性风险管理和基于证据治理的工具。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTabAD是一个用于上下文感知表格异常检测的基准数据集，通过恢复文本语义来解决现有基准缺乏语义上下文的问题，提供了20个包含结构化文本元数据的表格数据集和多种异常检测算法实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准仅提供原始数据点，缺乏语义上下文（如特征描述和领域知识），这限制了研究灵活性并阻碍模型充分利用领域知识进行检测。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了包括经典方法、深度学习和基于LLM的方法在内的最先进异常检测算法，还提出了一个无需任务特定训练的零样本LLM框架。

Result: 实验结果显示语义上下文提高了检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的作用和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Motivation: 反驳先前认为LLM深层作用有限的观点，通过系统性研究揭示深度层在不同评估设置下的真实贡献。

Method: 系统研究深度层利用情况，涵盖不同评估协议、任务类别和模型架构，分析各层在知识、检索、推理等方面的作用。

Result: 发现知识检索集中在浅层，推理准确性依赖深层但可通过蒸馏重塑；深度层作用高度异质且情境依赖。

Conclusion: LLM深度利用具有高度异质性和情境依赖性，需要基于任务、指标和模型的视角来理解和压缩大模型。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文评估AI模型在ConceptARC基准上的抽象推理能力，发现仅凭输出准确率会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，而低估视觉模态的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI模型是否真正理解ARC-AGI基准中的抽象概念，而非仅依赖表面模式，以更准确地评估模型的抽象推理能力。

Method: 在ConceptARC基准上评估模型，改变输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、推理努力程度，并分析模型生成的自然语言解释规则。

Result: 使用文本表示的模型输出准确率可匹敌人类，但其规则多基于表面捷径；视觉模态中模型准确率大幅下降，但仍能生成相当比例的抽象规则。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，仅凭准确率评估会误导对模型能力的判断，需要结合规则分析来更准确地评估抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大量多样化且标注良好的数据集，但数据收集面临隐私约束、法律限制和手动标注成本高昂的问题，成本可达数百万美元。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，使用FlexDoc生成的数据可将绝对F1分数提升高达11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在实际部署中加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Result: 实验证实主流DRAs在复杂任务上优于基于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍存在显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部防护、推理时引导、训练后对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限，需要新的动态、模块化安全控制方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软防护栏选择性激活原始MLP和安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略增强安全判别能力；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上，UpSafe°C对有害和越狱输入实现了稳健的安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力；安全温度机制实现了效用与安全性之间的帕累托最优前沿。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM安全指明了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)会缩小而非扩大语言模型的推理边界，揭示了负干扰和赢家通吃现象，并提出针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR被认为是提升大语言模型推理能力的关键方法，但近期证据表明它可能反而会缩小推理边界而非扩大。本文旨在深入探究RLVR的这种收缩问题及其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和在多个数学推理基准上的实证研究，揭示了RLVR学习动态中的两个关键现象：负干扰和赢家通吃现象。基于这些发现，提出了专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 研究表明，标准RL目标中的固有策略采样导致模型收敛到狭窄的解决方案策略，而提出的数据筛选算法在Pass@k性能上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: RLVR存在固有的学习动态问题，通过专注于低概率问题的数据筛选可以有效缓解这些问题，从而提升模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN)方法，通过生成多个代理执行轨迹并使用行为描述来选择最佳轨迹，显著提高了计算机使用代理在复杂任务中的成功率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个代理执行轨迹，并使用描述代理行为的行为叙述来进行轨迹选择，实现了广泛的探索和原则性的轨迹选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的最新SOTA性能，显著优于先前方法，接近人类72%的水平，并在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当采用结构化轨迹理解和选择时，扩展计算机使用代理具有显著效果，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

TL;DR: 提出RLAD方法，通过推理抽象来引导模型进行有效的算法推理，避免冗长和退化的探索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型模型在推理过程中往往无法一致地捕捉或重用过程，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型提出多个抽象描述，然后使用强化学习激励基于这些抽象构建解决方案，形成抽象生成器和解决方案生成器的双玩家RL训练范式

Result: 该方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有利于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Motivation: 生物信号模态间存在相关性，但缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了特定任务和模态的模型训练。现有知识蒸馏方法计算和内存开销大，特别是对于大型基础模型。

Method: 训练轻量级桥接网络对齐基础模型的中间表示，引入高效的桥接位置选择策略和灵活的原型网络作为桥接架构。

Result: 在多个生物信号模态、任务和数据集上的实验表明，BioX-Bridge将可训练参数减少88-99%，同时保持或优于现有方法的转移性能。

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge提供了一种高效的无监督跨模态知识转移解决方案，显著降低了计算和内存需求，同时保持了优越的性能。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [290] [Does Adoption of Zero Tillage Reduce Crop Residue Burning? Evidence from Satellite Remote Sensing and Household Survey Data in India](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01351)
*Dominik Naeher,Virginia Ziulu*

TL;DR: 零耕技术与作物残茬焚烧之间存在稳健的负相关关系，采用零耕技术可使焚烧发生率降低50%或更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于零耕技术采用与残茬焚烧之间联系的实证证据稀缺，这给政策制定者带来了困难。

Method: 整合高分辨率卫星图像与印度家庭调查数据，比较从遥感数据构建焚烧指标的不同方法，并评估其相对于调查数据的预测能力。

Result: 发现零耕与作物残茬焚烧之间存在稳健的负相关关系，在调查数据和卫星衍生指标中焚烧发生率均降低50%或更多。

Conclusion: 研究提供了关于最佳地理空间数据整合方法的见解，可为未来研究和支持可持续农业实践的政策干预提供方法学贡献。

Abstract: Previous research indicates that zero tillage technology offers a profitable
alternative to crop residue burning, with significant potential to reduce
agricultural emissions and contribute to improvements in air quality and public
health. Yet, empirical evidence on the link between zero tillage adoption and
residue burning remains scarce, adding to the difficulties policy makers face
in this context. This study addresses this gap by integrating high-resolution
satellite imagery with household survey data from India to examine the
empirical relationship between zero tillage and residue burning. We compare
different methods for constructing burn indicators from remote-sensing data and
assess their predictive power against survey-based measures. Our findings
reveal a robust negative association between zero tillage and crop residue
burning, with reductions in the incidence of burning of 50% or more across both
survey data and satellite-derived indicators. By providing insights into
optimal geospatial data integration methods, our study also makes a
methodological contribution that can inform future research and support
evidence-based policy interventions for more sustainable agricultural
practices.

TL;DR: 提出扩展萨缪尔森模型(ESM)，挑战市场不可预测的传统观点，通过多时间尺度分析识别市场转折点，并转化为可盈利的交易策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战股票市场不可预测的传统观点，证明日内价格变动并非随机噪声，而是存在可识别的动态因果过程。

Method: 开发扩展萨缪尔森模型(ESM)，基于自然科学框架分析多时间尺度的市场动态，识别峰值、谷值和转折点，并定义8种市场状态和6种方向信号。

Result: ESM能可靠预测短期反转和长期趋势，即使在突发新闻影响下也能捕捉市场波动，在平静期可捕获标普500指数10点波动，相当于每份E-mini期货合约500美元收益。

Conclusion: ESM不仅推进了对市场演化的科学理解，还提供了稳健可行的盈利交易路线图，与文艺复兴科技公司Medallion基金的系统性日内交易方法相呼应。

Abstract: Equity markets have long been regarded as unpredictable, with intraday price
movements treated as stochastic noise. This study challenges that view by
introducing the Extended Samuelson Model (ESM), a natural science-based
framework that captures the dynamic, causal processes underlying market
behavior. ESM identifies peaks, troughs, and turning points across multiple
timescales and demonstrates temporal compatibility: finer timeframes contain
all signals of broader ones while offering sharper directional guidance. Beyond
theory, ESM translates into practical trading strategies. During intraday
sessions, it reliably anticipates short-term reversals and longer-term trends,
even under the influence of breaking news. Its eight market states and six
directional signals provide actionable guardrails for traders, enabling
consistent profit opportunities. Notably, even during calm periods, ESM can
capture 10-point swings in the S&P 500, equivalent to $500 per E-mini futures
contract. These findings resonate with the state-based approaches attributed to
Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund, which delivered extraordinary returns
through systematic intraday trading. By bridging normal conditions with crisis
dynamics, ESM not only advances the scientific understanding of market
evolution but also provides a robust, actionable roadmap for profitable
trading.

Motivation: 研究短期温度冲击对投票行为的影响，探讨气候变化如何影响政治选举结果和政党体系。

Method: 结合高分辨率气候数据与1989-2019年欧洲议会选举结果，利用选举前异常温暖和炎热天气的外生变化识别温度冲击对投票行为的影响。

Result: 温度冲击导致意识形态极化降低，选票集中度增加，自由党和社民党支持率上升，右翼政党得票率下降。政党纲领在温暖选举背景下更强调气候议题。

Conclusion: 气候冲击能够推动政党体系向中间靠拢，削弱政治极端势力，表明气候变化对政治格局具有重要影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on European Parliament
elections. We combine high-resolution climate data with results from
parliamentary elections between 1989 and 2019, aggregated at the NUTS-2
regional level. Exploiting exogenous variation in unusually warm and hot days
during the months preceding elections, we identify the effect of short-run
temperature shocks on voting behaviour. We find that temperature shocks reduce
ideological polarisation and increase vote concentration, as voters consolidate
around larger, more moderate parties. This aggregated pattern is explained by a
gain in support of liberal and, to a lesser extent, social democratic parties,
while right-wing parties lose vote share. Consistent with a salience mechanism,
complementary analysis of party manifestos shows greater emphasis on
climate-related issues in warmer pre-electoral contexts. Overall, our findings
indicate that climate shocks can shift party systems toward the centre and
weaken political extremes.

Motivation: 农业政策影响高度多样化的农场，这些农场在规模、土地构成、当地气候和灌溉可用性等方面存在显著差异，需要一种能够应对这种异质性的建模方法。

Method: 构建了一个基于代理的模型（ABM），使用意大利农场的代表性调查数据进行初始化，并将其扩展到全国规模。该模型与全球小麦市场模型和环境影响评估工具集成。

Result: 开发了一个集成框架，能够考虑全球价格与本地生产之间的反馈循环，同时评估政策措施的环境影响。

Conclusion: 该集成建模方法为政策制定者提供了支持可持续小麦生产决策的有效工具，能够处理农场异质性和系统复杂性。

Abstract: This work outlines the modeling steps for developing a tool aimed at
supporting policymakers in guiding policies toward more sustainable wheat
production. In the agricultural sector,policies affect a highly diverse set of
farms, which differ across several dimensions such as size,land composition,
local climate, and irrigation availability. To address this significant
heterogeneity, we construct an Agent-Based Model (ABM). The model is
initialized using a representative survey of Italian farms, which captures
their heterogeneity. The ABM is then scaled to include a number of farms
comparable to those operating nationwide. To capture broader dynamics, the ABM
is integrated with two additional components:a global model of international
wheat markets and a tool for assessing the environmental impacts of wheat
production. This integrated framework enables us to account for the feedback
loop between global prices and local production while evaluating the
environmental implications of policy measures.
