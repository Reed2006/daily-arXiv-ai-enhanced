### [1] [Rethinking Toxicity Evaluation in Large Language Models: A Multi-Label Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15007)
*Zhiqiang Kou,Junyang Chen,Xin-Qiang Cai,Ming-Kun Xie,Biao Liu,Changwei Wang,Lei Feng,Yuheng Jia,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了三个多标签毒性检测基准Q-A-MLL、R-A-MLL和H-X-MLL，基于15类毒性分类体系，并开发了基于伪标签的毒性检测方法，显著优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek等先进基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉现实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致有偏评估（漏检和误报），且细粒度多标签标注成本高昂。

Method: 从公共毒性数据集构建三个多标签基准，采用15类毒性分类体系进行标注；理论证明伪标签训练优于单标签监督；开发基于伪标签的毒性检测方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著超越了GPT-4o和DeepSeek等先进基线，能够更准确可靠地评估LLM生成内容中的多标签毒性。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法有效解决了现有毒性检测的局限性，为LLM生成内容的多标签毒性评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

### [2] [Can generative AI figure out figurative language? The influence of idioms on essay scoring by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15009)
*Enis Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了生成式AI模型对包含和不包含习语的学生作文的评分表现，发现Gemini在评分一致性和处理比喻语言方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在自动作文评分系统中的应用日益增多，本研究旨在评估AI模型在处理包含习语的作文时的表现，因为习语可能成为AI处理的潜在限制因素。

Method: 从348篇学生作文中创建两个相等的作文列表：一个包含多个习语，另一个不含习语。使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Deepseek三个生成式AI模型，按照人类评分者使用的相同评分标准对两组作文各评分三次。

Result: 所有模型都显示出优秀的评分一致性，但Gemini在与人类评分者的评分者间信度方面表现最佳。对于包含多个习语的作文，Gemini的评分模式与人类评分者最为相似。所有模型在评分中均未表现出对任何人口群体的可检测偏见。

Conclusion: 虽然研究中的模型展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini由于其处理比喻语言的能力，是处理作文评分任务的最佳候选者，并显示出未来单独处理此类任务的前景。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

### [3] [A Generalizable Rhetorical Strategy Annotation Model Using LLM-based Debate Simulation and Labelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15081)
*Shiyu Ji,Farnoosh Hashemi,Joice Chen,Juanwen Pan,Weicheng Ma,Hefan Zhang,Sophia Pan,Ming Cheng,Shubham Mohole,Saeed Hassanpour,Soroush Vosoughi,Michael Macy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出利用大语言模型自动生成和标注辩论数据的新框架，基于因果、经验、情感、道德四种修辞类型，训练的分类器在多个外部语料库上表现优异，并应用于说服力预测和政治辩论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修辞策略分析依赖人工标注，成本高、不一致、难以扩展，现有数据集局限于特定主题和策略，限制了模型的稳健发展。

Method: 利用大语言模型自动生成和标注合成辩论数据，基于四部分修辞类型学，在LLM标注的数据集上微调基于Transformer的分类器。

Result: 模型在人类标注数据和多个外部语料库上表现出高性能和强泛化能力，应用于说服力预测和政治辩论分析，发现美国总统辩论中情感论证使用增加。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效自动生成和标注修辞策略数据，训练的分类器具有高性能和强泛化能力，为修辞策略分析提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

### [4] [Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103)
*Jessy Lin,Luke Zettlemoyer,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-Tau Yih,Aram Markosyan,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Barlas Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出稀疏记忆微调方法，通过只更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽来减少灾难性遗忘，在问答任务中相比全微调和LoRA显著降低了遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常是静态的，持续学习的主要障碍是灾难性遗忘。受参数共享导致遗忘困难的直觉启发，研究稀疏参数更新是否能实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调，利用记忆层模型（Berges等，2024）的稀疏更新特性，只更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽，减少新知识与模型现有能力之间的干扰。

Result: 在问答任务评估中，稀疏记忆微调学习新知识的同时遗忘显著减少：NaturalQuestions F1在全微调后下降89%，LoRA下降71%，而稀疏记忆微调仅下降11%。

Conclusion: 记忆层中的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

### [5] [Measuring the Effect of Disfluency in Multilingual Knowledge Probing Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15115)
*Kirill Semenov,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现MLAMA多语言基准测试中的模板翻译方法存在语法和语义问题，通过使用Google Translate和ChatGPT进行句子级翻译后，知识检索分数显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLAMA等多语言基准测试使用模板翻译方法，忽略了命名实体的语法和语义信息，导致提示语句不流畅或错误，影响分数解释性，特别是在形态丰富的语言中。

Method: 从MLAMA数据集中选取4种斯拉夫语言，比较原始模板翻译与Google Translate和ChatGPT句子级翻译的知识检索分数，并对5种其他语系语言进行额外分析。

Result: 使用句子级翻译后，知识检索分数显著增加，在斯拉夫语言和其他语系语言中都观察到相似模式。

Conclusion: 建议在多语言数据集中控制语法正确性以获得更高和更可解释的结果，神经机器翻译或LLM系统的整句翻译是良好近似方法。

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:
https://github.com/ZurichNLP/Fluent-mLAMA.

### [6] [Latent Topic Synthesis: Leveraging LLMs for Electoral Ad Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15125)
*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的框架，通过无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型自动从无标签语料库生成可解释的主题分类法，并应用于2024年美国总统选举前的Meta政治广告分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中扮演关键角色，但分析其庞大且快速演化的内容仍然是一个主要挑战。需要一种可扩展、可解释的方法来分析政治信息。

Method: 结合无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。应用该框架分析2024年美国总统选举前Meta政治广告语料库。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告在总支出和展示中占主导地位，而堕胎和选举诚信获得不成比例的覆盖范围。资金模式高度极化：经济诉求主要由保守派PAC推动，堕胎信息在支持和反对权利联盟间分裂，犯罪与司法运动分散在地方委员会中。

Conclusion: 该工作支持对社交媒体政治信息的可扩展、可解释分析，使研究人员、政策制定者和公众能够更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态以及数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FarsiMCQGen是一个用于生成波斯语多选题的创新方法，结合候选生成、过滤和排序技术，利用Transformer和知识图谱生成高质量的干扰项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言如波斯语中生成高质量的多选题仍然是一个重大挑战，需要开发专门的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合候选生成、过滤和排序技术，利用Transformer和知识图谱与基于规则的方法集成，生成可信的干扰项。基于维基百科的通用知识问题数据构建。

Result: 创建了一个包含10,289个问题的新型波斯语多选题数据集，经多个最先进的大语言模型评估，证明了模型的有效性和生成数据集的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在波斯语中生成高质量多选题的有效性，所创建的数据集有望激发更多关于多选题的研究。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

### [8] [Structure-R1: Dynamically Leveraging Structural Knowledge in LLM Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15191)
*Junlin Wu,Xianrui Zhong,Jiashuo Sun,Bolian Li,Bowen Jin,Jiawei Han,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习将检索内容转换为结构化表示，优化多步推理过程，在7B规模模型上达到与更大模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用非结构化文本导致信息密度低、推理效果不佳，需要更高效的结构化知识表示来增强LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习学习内容表示策略，动态生成适应多步推理需求的结构化格式，并引入自奖励结构验证机制确保生成结构的质量和可靠性。

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模模型取得竞争性性能，匹配更大模型的表现。

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度来增强推理能力，Structure-R1框架为知识密集型任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

### [9] [Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15231)
*Yuatyong Chaichana,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Potsawee Manakul,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT两种方法来解决LALMs的音频上下文窗口限制问题，前者是无训练的音频位置扩展方法，后者是训练时的位置增强策略，显著提升了长音频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型受限于短的音频上下文窗口，即使其文本主干支持长上下文，这限制了长音频理解能力。现有上下文扩展方法主要针对单模态LLMs，在LALMs中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的无训练音频扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置，保持文本位置不变以保留基础LLM的文本能力；2. VLAT：将Partial YaRN扩展到训练时的位置增强，在训练中模拟不同音频长度，实现泛化到远超训练时所见长度的输入。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略带来显著改进，在未见长度的长音频上实现了强大性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT有效解决了LALMs的长音频上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN作为无训练方法提供了即时的性能提升，而VLAT通过训练增强进一步提高了对长音频的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

*Lina Berrayana,Ahmed Heakl,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Thomas Hofmann,Salman Khan,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了离散扩散语言模型（DDLM）与自回归语言模型（ARM）的混合架构，发现将DDLM规划器与ARM执行器结合，特别是在潜在空间中进行通信，能显著提高准确性并大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长序列标记，计算成本高。离散扩散语言模型支持并行生成且在处理复杂推理任务时表现出色，研究旨在探索两者结合是否能产生互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间探索协作，一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行最终答案。然后扩展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影器将DDLM潜在表示映射到ARM嵌入空间，绕过扩散模型的文本生成限制。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间的DDLM→ARM通信带来显著准确性提升：DART-5从27.0%提高到54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提高到14.0%。使用64个标记进行规划和约5个标记执行，在DART-5和AIME上超越Qwen3.1-7B，而后者使用了44倍多的标记。

Conclusion: DDLM规划器与ARM执行器的混合架构能提供显著计算节省且几乎不影响准确性，为DDLM在推理任务中的应用提供了新见解，并突显了其在混合架构中的潜力。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了多模态RAG在文档理解中的应用，提出了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，总结了关键数据集、基准和应用，并指出了效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性等开放挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档理解方法存在局限性：OCR+LLM流水线会丢失结构细节，而原生多模态LLM在上下文建模方面存在困难。多模态RAG能够实现跨所有模态的整体检索和推理，从而解锁全面的文档智能。

Method: 提出基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，综述涉及图结构和智能体框架的进展，总结关键数据集、基准和应用。

Result: 建立了多模态RAG的系统性框架，识别了该领域的关键技术进展和应用场景。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG是文档AI的重要发展方向，但仍面临效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性等挑战，为未来研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

*Mucheng Ren,He Chen,Yuchen Yan,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceCoder是一个集成多源外部知识的自动化ICD编码框架，通过动态整合UMLS、维基百科和大型语言模型等知识源来增强代码表示、弥合语义差距，并处理罕见和模糊代码，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化ICD编码方法面临的临床文本与ICD代码之间的语义差距、罕见和长尾代码性能差以及可解释性有限等问题。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合多源外部知识（UMLS、Wikipedia、LLMs）来丰富代码表示，并引入混合注意力机制来建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互。

Result: 在MIMIC-III-ICD9、MIMIC-IV-ICD9和MIMIC-IV-ICD10数据集上的实验表明，TraceCoder实现了最先进的性能，消融研究验证了其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了一个可扩展且稳健的解决方案，符合临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

*Mucheng Ren,Yucheng Yan,He Chen,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程来处理医学文本的复杂性差异，在多种临床任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等难度，忽略了复杂性的内在差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力。

Method: TACL框架基于渐进学习原则，根据样本复杂度动态调整训练过程：将数据分类为不同难度级别，在训练早期优先处理简单案例以建立坚实基础，然后逐步处理更复杂的记录。

Result: 在包括英语和中文临床记录的多语言医学数据上应用TACL，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等多种临床任务中观察到显著改进。

Conclusion: TACL不仅提升了自动化系统的性能，还展示了统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医学文本理解解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了EGP框架，通过检索相似示例问题及其成功推理路径来指导LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划过程，显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识图谱问答中面临自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱之间的语义鸿沟，导致规划效果不佳和探索效率低下，而无需训练的方法往往无法充分利用训练数据中的宝贵推理模式。

Method: EGP框架：1）通过实体模板化预处理训练集问题；2）使用语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例及其推理路径；3）在任务分解和关系探索两个阶段动态指导LLM规划；4）引入Smart Lookahead机制提高探索效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导的规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的性能，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Motivation: 研究自动作文评分(AES)的有效性，为书面内容评估提供高效准确的工具。

Method: 使用向量空间模型(VSM)和n-gram表示（一元、二元、三元文法），通过Jaccard系数和余弦相似度计算作文相似度得分，并用均方根误差(RMSE)评估系统性能。

Result: 余弦相似度优于Jaccard系数；一元文法比二元和三元文法具有更低的RMSE。

Conclusion: 在自动作文评分中，余弦相似度比Jaccard系数更有效，且一元文法特征提取表现最佳。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

TL;DR: CoordGen是一个移动推理框架，通过结合推测解码和动态硬件调度来加速移动设备上的上下文感知文本生成，实现了最高3.8倍的生成速度提升和4.7倍的能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备上的大语言模型虽然可以通过本地数据获得上下文信息实现个性化生成，但token-by-token的生成过程由于内存限制特性导致高延迟和硬件利用率低的问题。

Method: 框架包含三个协同组件：自适应执行调度（动态平衡预填充和解码阶段的计算图）、上下文对齐草稿（通过轻量级在线校准提高推测效率）、硬件高效草稿扩展（重用和扩展中间序列以提高并行性和降低验证成本）。

Result: 在多个智能手机和代表性工作负载上的实验显示，与现有移动推理解决方案相比，生成速度最高提升3.8倍，能效最高提升4.7倍。组件级分析进一步验证了每个优化的贡献。

Conclusion: CoordGen通过推测解码与动态硬件调度的集成，有效解决了移动设备上LLM推理的内存限制问题，显著提升了生成性能和能效。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型在古典诗歌生成和评估领域的表现，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 采用三步评估框架：计算指标、LLM作为评判者评估、人类专家验证，评估了六个最先进的LLM在诗歌质量多个维度的表现。

Result: 发现LLMs在评估创意质量时存在"回音室"效应，往往收敛于与人类判断不同的有缺陷标准。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs作为文学生成代理既有潜力也有局限性，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中仍需要人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

TL;DR: AutoGraph-R1是首个使用强化学习直接优化知识图谱构建以提升任务性能的框架，通过将图生成作为策略学习问题，基于知识图谱在RAG管道中的功能效用设计奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建过程与下游应用脱节，导致图结构不优化，阻碍了检索增强生成在问答系统中的有效性。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM构造器，将图生成建模为策略学习问题，设计了两种任务感知的奖励函数：知识载体图和知识索引图。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，AutoGraph-R1使图RAG方法相比任务无关基线图获得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作表明可以在构建和应用之间建立闭环，将范式从构建内在'好'的图转向构建可证明'有用'的图。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可读性评估领域存在定义不一致和依赖表层文本属性的问题，需要探索更符合人类感知的评估方法。

Method: 分析了897个人类判断，评估了15个传统可读性指标和6个基于模型的指标在5个英语数据集上的表现。

Result: 4个基于模型的指标在与人类判断的相关性排名中始终位列前四，而表现最好的传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法是可读性评估的更有前景方向，能够更好地捕捉影响人类可读性感知的因素。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

Motivation: 现有集成方法在长文本生成中效果不佳，因为每个token都集成会导致性能下降，需要找到合适的集成位置。

Method: 提出SAFE框架，基于分词不匹配和概率分布共识选择性集成，并引入概率锐化策略来稳定集成过程。

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得增益。

Conclusion: 选择性集成策略在长文本生成中至关重要，SAFE通过智能选择集成位置实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在多样化文档类型上泛化能力差，特别是在分布外数据上表现不佳，且高质量布局感知解析训练数据有限

Method: 使用强化学习框架LayoutRL，通过整合归一化编辑距离、段落计数准确性和阅读顺序保持的复合奖励来优化布局理解，并构建Infinity-Doc-400K数据集

Result: 在OmniDocBench、olmOCR-Bench、PubTabNet和FinTabNet等基准测试中，Infinity-Parser在各种文档类型、语言和结构复杂性上均实现最先进性能

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型显著提升了文档解析的泛化能力，在多样化文档解析任务中优于专业文档解析系统和通用视觉语言模型

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

Motivation: 现有Speech-LLMs评估多基于理想化输入，忽视了常见的语音不流畅问题，特别是与帕金森病等疾病相关的语音障碍，需要检验这些模型在语音障碍用户场景下的实际表现。

Method: 引入VocalBench-DF框架，基于多维度分类法系统评估语音不流畅问题，对22个主流Speech-LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 评估显示Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下性能显著下降，识别出音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈。通过增强组件和管道的识别与推理能力可显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前Speech-LLMs在实际应用中的准备度有限，迫切需要新方法来改进语音不流畅处理，构建真正包容的Speech-LLMs。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

Motivation: 在线游戏平台需要有效的广告和推荐系统，但现有推荐方法不适合游戏场景，主要面临游戏稀疏性(仅数百款游戏)和游戏不平衡性(用户行为集中在少数热门游戏)两大挑战。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期(UGL)来丰富用户行为数据，提出两种创新策略提取用户短期和长期兴趣，使用逆概率掩码策略处理UGL表示学习中的游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告CVR平均提升21.67%，游戏内物品推荐离线AUC提升0.5%，在线ARPU提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示能有效解决游戏推荐中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，显著提升游戏广告和游戏内物品推荐的性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

Motivation: 检索增强生成系统在基于马来西亚临床实践指南提供事实指导方面很重要，但对于基于图像的查询效果有限，因为通用视觉语言模型的描述缺乏临床特异性和事实基础。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏管道创建皮肤病学、眼底和胸部放射学领域的合成数据集，并使用参数高效的QLoRA方法对MedGemma模型进行微调。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个专门化医学视觉语言模型的强大管道，并验证了所得模型作为高质量查询生成器的有效性，为增强基于证据的临床决策支持中的多模态RAG系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Conclusion: 感知增强对小模型有益，思维导向方法对所有模型都有效，为多模态主动推理研究指明了方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在摘要质量和可控性方面的问题，探索如何通过提示工程提升大语言模型的摘要生成能力。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量影响显著，过短或过长的提示都会降低质量；数据噪声增加会导致ROUGE-L分数下降；新闻文本处理效果最佳，学术文章处理效果较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以有效提升大语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要信息；本地LLM容量有限，任务成功率低。需要平衡隐私保护和任务准确性。

Method: 包含三个组件：布局感知块分区、协同规划、协同决策，以及多轮累积机制来缓解本地误判。

Result: 实验显示CORE减少UI暴露达55.6%，任务成功率略低于纯云端代理，有效缓解隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE在移动代理中成功平衡了隐私保护和任务准确性，为隐私敏感的移动应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen

and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local

### [28] [DeceptionBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for AI Deception Behaviors in Real-world Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15501)
*Yao Huang,Yitong Sun,Yichi Zhang,Ruochen Zhang,Yinpeng Dong,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeceptionBench是首个系统评估大语言模型在不同社会领域中欺骗行为的基准测试，涵盖经济、医疗、教育、社交和娱乐五个领域，包含150个场景和1000多个样本。研究发现当前模型在强化动态下欺骗行为加剧，缺乏对操纵性情境线索的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的快速提升，出现了新兴的欺骗行为，可能在高风险部署中带来严重风险。目前对现实场景中欺骗行为的系统性研究仍然不足。

Method: 建立DeceptionBench基准测试，从内在维度（利己主义倾向与讨好行为）和外在维度（中性条件、奖励激励和强制压力下的情境因素）评估欺骗行为，并引入持续多轮交互循环模拟现实反馈动态。

Result: 对大语言模型和大推理模型的广泛实验揭示了关键漏洞，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为被放大，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性情境线索的鲁棒抵抗力。

Conclusion: 当前模型对各种欺骗行为缺乏有效的防护机制，迫切需要开发先进的保护措施来应对这些风险。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available
at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

*Ashutosh Bajpai,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为TEMP-ReCon的新基准，用于评估LLMs在时间敏感查询中的时间指称一致性，并开发了UnTRaP模型来提升LLMs的时间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在时间敏感领域（如法律、医疗、金融）的广泛应用，需要确保其不仅事实准确，还要具备跨时间维度的一致性，但目前缺乏针对时间指称一致性的评估和增强方法。

Method: 提出了TEMP-ReCon基准来评估开源和闭源LLMs在多语言环境下的时间指称一致性，并开发了基于推理路径对齐的UnTRaP模型来增强LLMs的时间一致性。

Result: 实验发现LLMs确实表现出不足的时间指称一致性，而UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型在提升时间一致性方面表现出显著效果。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了LLMs时间一致性评估的空白，提出的基准和模型为提升LLMs在时间敏感应用中的可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态字符分组方法，利用现有BPE分词结构，通过添加显式补丁结束标记和二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，实现高效、灵活且语言无关的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在表示稀有词时的低效性和需要大嵌入矩阵的问题，同时避免字符级模型在Transformer架构中的性能瓶颈。

Method: 在现有BPE分词基础上添加显式补丁结束标记，并引入二级BPE压缩阶段来控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在性能上匹配或优于基于动态熵和空格的补丁策略，同时保持紧凑的词汇表。

Conclusion: 提出的动态字符分组方法提供了一种高效、灵活且语言无关的表示方案，成功结合了子词和字符级模型的优势。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

*Jingcheng Deng,Liang Pang,Zihao Wei,Shichen Xu,Zenghao Duan,Kun Xu,Yang Song,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent-SFT是一种两阶段学习框架，通过在词汇表概率的叠加空间中进行潜在推理，匹配显式推理性能的同时将推理链缩短4倍，实现计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式推理（如思维链）计算开销大，而现有潜在推理方法性能显著下降，主要原因是非结构化的潜在空间难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出Latent-SFT两阶段框架：第一阶段设计专用注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上达到新SOTA，匹配显式SFT性能同时推理链缩短4倍；在Math500和AIME24上，基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，有效压缩率和有效全局并行度指标验证了这一观点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种模态组合感知框架，通过偏好损失和组合正则化目标来缓解统一编码器在对比学习中容易学习模态捷径的问题，提高分布偏移下的检索鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管统一编码器在多模态检索中具有灵活性，但传统的对比学习方法容易导致模态捷径学习，在分布偏移下表现不佳。

Method: 使用偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态嵌入，并通过组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分组成的原型对齐。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，该方法在分布外检索任务上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术实现通用推测解码，解决传统推测解码中草稿模型和目标模型必须共享词汇表的限制，实现1.57倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法要求草稿模型和目标模型共享词汇表，限制了可用草稿模型的选择，往往需要从头训练新模型，这限制了推测解码的实用性。

Method: 基于动态时间规整(DTW)算法，提出TokenTiming算法，通过重新编码草稿标记序列获得新的目标标记序列，然后使用DTW建立映射来传输概率分布进行推测采样。

Result: 在各种任务上的综合实验表明，该方法实现了1.57倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作实现了草稿模型选择的通用方法，使推测解码成为更通用和实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表征的差异，但本文提出目标语言响应方差才是主要因素，需要新的理论框架来解释这一现象。

Method: 采用偏差-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，通过实验验证假设，并设计了多种推理时干预方法来控制响应方差，包括简单的提示指令。

Result: 实验证明控制响应方差能有效减少跨语言差距，简单的提示指令使目标语言准确率提升了20-25%，验证了方差是主要因素。

Conclusion: 跨语言差距主要由目标语言响应方差引起，通过控制方差的方法可以有效改善多语言知识获取的性能。

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但容易产生幻觉且在多跳推理方面存在困难。现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法依赖扁平嵌入和噪声路径探索，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出ParallaxRAG框架，将查询和图三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，构建更清晰的子图，利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特点，引导LLMs进行基于知识的逐步推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，该框架在检索和问答性能方面具有竞争力，同时减少了幻觉并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图注意力头专业化是知识基础多跳推理的一个原则性方向，为减少LLMs幻觉和提高推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主要关注英语模型，忽略了其他语言的语言和文化特点，特别是韩语在语法、形态特征、敬语系统和双数系统方面的独特性。

Method: 设计了KITE基准，结合自动指标和人工评估，针对多样化的开放式指令跟随任务进行评估。

Result: 评估揭示了不同模型之间的性能差异，并深入了解了它们的优势和劣势。

Conclusion: 通过公开发布KITE数据集和代码，旨在促进文化和语言包容性LLM开发的进一步研究，并激励其他代表性不足语言的类似努力。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation

Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法如TK-PERT和最优传输在准确性方面表现良好，但在处理大规模网络挖掘数据时，效率和速度成为关键考虑因素。

Method: 开发了跨语言双向最大相似度评分(BiMax)来计算文档间相似度，并提供了公开工具EmbDA。

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax达到与最优传输方法相当的准确性，同时速度提升约100倍。

Conclusion: BiMax方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了文档对齐的效率，为大规模跨语言文档处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully

introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained
error analysis. We show that our approach is competitive and scales effectively
to long documents. Finally, we demonstrate its usefulness to infer the gender

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个诊断套件，用于评估语言模型在科学问题中提出多种合理解释的能力，通过有效性、独特性和覆盖率三个指标来衡量模型在不确定问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流中的广泛应用，需要评估它们提出多种解释（而非单一正确答案）的能力，因为许多科学问题存在不确定性，多个机制不同的假设可能与相同观测结果一致。

Method: HypoSpace将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，测量三个互补指标：有效性（与观测一致的提案精度）、独特性（提案间的非冗余性）和覆盖率（对枚举可接受集的覆盖）。在三个结构化领域实例化：因果图、重力约束3D体素重建和布尔遗传相互作用。

Result: 在指令调优和推理导向模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间的增长，独特性和覆盖率会下降，揭示了仅正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃现象。

Conclusion: HypoSpace为明确探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法提供了一个受控探针，而非排行榜，有助于评估模型在不确定科学问题中的表现。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Method: 提出两种上下文生成策略（命名实体和全文提示）和四种整合方法（文本拼接、嵌入拼接、分层transformer融合、LLM驱动文本增强）。

Result: 在文本Latent Hatred数据集和多模态MAMI数据集上，相比零上下文基线，最佳系统分别获得3和6个F1分数提升，嵌入拼接方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文信息及其整合方法对仇恨言论检测至关重要，嵌入拼接是最有效的整合策略。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然掩码扩散语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案显示出潜力，但其内部工作机制尚未得到充分探索，特别是注意力模式的特性需要深入研究。

Method: 通过实证分析DLMs的注意力模式，重点关注注意力沉没现象，并与自回归模型进行对比研究。

Result: 发现DLMs的注意力沉没位置在生成过程中动态变化，且对注意力沉没的屏蔽仅导致轻微性能下降，表现出比ARMs更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散语言模型在注意力分配和利用方面的根本性差异，为理解其内部工作机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法依赖固定格式任务和参考答案，难以捕捉现代LLM的细微、主观和开放式行为特征，需要更有效的评估方式。

Method: 采用自动互评估方法，让LLM通过自玩和同行评审相互评估输出，结合博弈论投票算法聚合同行评审结果，并与人类投票行为进行系统性比较。

Result: 实证结果显示理论预测与人类评估之间存在收敛和分歧，揭示了互评估方法的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 这是首个将互评估、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合来评估LLM能力的工作，为LLM评估提供了新的理论框架和实践方法。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需参考翻译的机器翻译质量评估方法，通过逐段翻译和NLP混洗测试来验证翻译器质量，特别适用于复杂语言和动物通信翻译场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在没有参考翻译的情况下如何验证AI翻译器（如鲸语翻译器）质量的问题，避免依赖动物交互或观察，提高安全性、伦理性和成本效益。

Method: 使用逐段翻译结合经典NLP混洗测试：逐段翻译动物通信，评估翻译结果在正确顺序下比随机排列时更有意义的频率。

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言上的概念验证实验表明，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估高度相关。

Conclusion: 交互在翻译学习早期阶段可能既不必要也不高效，提出的无参考评估方法在复杂语言场景下具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大语言模型存在区分真假陈述的线性子空间，但其产生机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过透明模型揭示这种线性真值表示的具体形成路径。

Method: 构建一个单层Transformer玩具模型，在事实陈述共现的数据分布下进行训练，观察模型如何学习区分真假陈述以降低语言建模损失。

Result: 在玩具模型中观察到两阶段学习动态：先快速记忆个体事实关联，后长时间学习线性分离真假陈述，从而降低语言建模损失。在预训练语言模型中也验证了这一模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了线性真值表示在语言模型中涌现的机制性证明和实证动机，揭示了其通过数据共现模式自然形成的过程。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

Method: 提出了Paper2Web基准数据集和多维评估框架，包含基于规则的指标和人类验证的LLM-as-a-Judge评估。开发了PWAgent自主管道，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Result: 实验表明PWAgent在学术网页生成任务中显著优于端到端基线方法（如基于模板的网页和arXiv/alphaXiv版本），同时保持低成本，达到了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估基准，PWAgent通过迭代优化方法能够生成高质量的交互式学术主页，在多个评估维度上表现优异。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Motivation: 传统槽位填充任务采用语音识别和自然语言理解的级联方法，而语音大语言模型的出现为以更统一、生成式和指令跟随的方式实现语音理解任务提供了新途径，同时具有零样本能力和对未见槽标签的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语音大语言模型在槽位填充任务中具有潜力，通过系统改进可以显著提升性能，但仍需解决实际应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于评分标准的增量强化学习，在开放领域（特别是医疗咨询）中解决了奖励函数模糊的问题，将Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型在HealthBench-Hard基准上的性能从7.0提升到27.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学和代码等有明确奖励函数的领域表现出色，但在医疗咨询等开放领域，由于奖励模糊、主观且依赖上下文，缺乏稳健的奖励函数，限制了RL的应用。

Method: ORBIT框架结合合成对话生成和动态评分标准创建，使用这些评分标准指导增量强化学习过程，不依赖外部医学知识或手动规则，而是通过评分标准引导的反馈来塑造学习。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上实施ORBIT，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0大幅提升至27.2，达到该规模模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 评分标准驱动的强化学习在不同咨询场景中带来一致性能提升，证明基于评分标准的反馈是推进LLM在复杂开放任务中发展的可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法学习的技能往往过度专业化于单一网站，缺乏泛化能力。需要一种能够学习可跨网站重用的通用技能的方法。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性启发，将技能的抽象目标（要完成什么）与具体实现（如何执行）解耦，使智能体能够识别和优化自身目标。

Result: 在已见网站上技能重用率提高1.7倍；在Mind2Web和未见网站上成功率分别提升9.4%和13.9%，同时步骤减少超过20%；在自探索设置中提升了任务质量。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是实现能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤，为构建适应性环境中的持续学习智能体提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型的开放度选择是当前AI生态系统的核心问题，但其背后的经济驱动力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个两期博弈论模型，包含在位开发者、下游部署者和进入开发者，分析开放度如何影响AI价值链竞争。

Result: 发现当数据飞轮效应处于中等强度时，在位开发者会策略性限制开放度以阻碍进入者学习；政策干预如透明度要求、垂直整合和补贴可能产生反效果。

Conclusion: 通过建模开发者对竞争和监管压力的战略响应，为分析复杂FM生态系统中的竞争和设计有效政策提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: The strategic choice of model "openness" has become a defining issue for the
foundation model (FM) ecosystem. While this choice is intensely debated, its
underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period
game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value
chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant
developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to
the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a "data
flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the
deployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's
optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of
the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very
strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an
intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's
learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy
paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic
flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to
show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical
integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel
effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient
competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be
captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness
adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the
developer's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we
provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective
policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.

<details>

Motivation: 传统离散处理参数方法无法充分捕捉空间效应的连续性和动态演化，需要开发能够表征处理强度在时空上连续变化的分析框架。

Method: 使用纳维-斯托克斯偏微分方程建立连续函数框架，将处理强度建模为τ(x,t)函数，通过32,520个美国邮政编码数据进行实证验证。

Result: 发现医疗可及性存在指数空间衰减（κ=0.002837/km），边界距离为37.1km；对数衰减模型优于指数衰减（ΔAIC>10,000）；老年人群距离效应强2-13倍；教育梯度显著。

Conclusion: 连续函数框架提供了传统DID方法不具备的预测能力、参数敏感性和诊断测试，适用于环境经济学、银行和医疗政策等领域。

Abstract: I develop a continuous functional framework for spatial treatment effects
grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete
treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as
continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous
analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure.
Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential
spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 =
0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully
diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate
diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly
signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$
stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education
gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential
($\Delta \text{AIC} > 10,000$), representing a middle ground between
exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics,
banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides
predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity
($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional
difference-in-differences approaches.

Method: 为美国能源部的EEIO-IDA模型开发物理扩展，将经济分为商品生产和服务生产子部门，使用贸易数据（如UN Comtrade）和物理生产数据（如美国地质调查局）量化物质流动，对缺乏原始数据的子部门采用价格估算和质量平衡假设。

Abstract: A physical assessment of material flows in an economy (e.g., material flow
quantification) can support the development of sustainable decarbonization and
circularity strategies by providing the tangible physical context of industrial
production quantities and supply chain relationships. However, completing a
physical assessment is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality raw data
and poor harmonization across industry classification systems used in data
reporting. Here we describe a new physical extension for the U.S. Department of
Energy's (DOE's) EEIO for Industrial Decarbonization (EEIO-IDA) model, yielding
an expanded EEIO model that is both physically and environmentally extended. In
the model framework, the U.S. economy is divided into goods-producing and
service-producing subsectors, and mass flows are quantified for each
goods-producing subsector using a combination of trade data (e.g., UN Comtrade)
and physical production data (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey). Given that
primary-source production data are not available for all subsectors,
price-imputation and mass-balance assumptions are developed and used to

*Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula,Manish Kumar Singh*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于考试答卷强制交换的博弈论框架来分析学术不端行为，该惩罚机制通过制造战略互依性比传统处罚更具威慑力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学术不端处罚效果有限，需要探索更有效的威慑机制，特别是能创造相互脆弱性的非传统惩罚方式。

Method: 构建非合作博弈模型，包含信息不对称，分析三种基础情景：非对称准备水平、相互不准备、协调性部分准备。

Result: 答卷交换惩罚比传统处罚产生更强威慑效应，纳什均衡分析显示相互准备成为主导策略。

Conclusion: 创造相互脆弱性的非传统惩罚机制比传统个体处罚更有效，为机构政策设计提供新思路，建议未来进行实证验证和行为实验。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel game theoretic framework for analyzing academic
dishonesty through the lens of a unique deterrent mechanism: forced exam script
swapping between students caught copying. We model the strategic interactions
between students as a non cooperative game with asymmetric information and
examine three base scenarios asymmetric preparation levels, mutual non
preparation, and coordinated partial preparation. Our analysis reveals that the
script swapping punishment creates a stronger deterrent effect than traditional
penalties by introducing strategic interdependence in outcomes. The Nash
equilibrium analysis demonstrates that mutual preparation emerges as the
dominant strategy. The framework provides insights for institutional policy
design, suggesting that unconventional punishment mechanisms that create mutual
vulnerability can be more effective than traditional individual penalties.
Future empirical validation and behavioral experiments are proposed to test the
model predictions, including explorations of tapering off effects in punishment
severity over time.

TL;DR: 国际移民对留守家庭的食品消费和饮食多样性有积极影响，移民家庭消费支出更高，饮食多样性增加，但同时也增加了不健康食品的消费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究国际移民对留守家庭食品消费和饮食多样性的影响，了解移民汇款如何改变家庭消费模式。

Method: 使用喀拉拉邦2011年移民调查数据，采用普通最小二乘法和工具变量方法进行分析。

Result: 移民家庭总体消费支出和食品支出更高，饮食多样性增加，蛋白质食品消费增加，但加工食品等不健康食品消费也增加。

Conclusion: 国际移民改善了留守家庭的消费能力和饮食多样性，但也带来了不健康饮食习惯的风险。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the impact of international migration on the food
consumption and dietary diversity of left-behind households. Using the Kerala
migration survey 2011, we study whether households with emigrants (on account
of international migration) have higher consumption expenditure and improved
dietary diversity than their non-migrating counterparts. We use ordinary least
square and instrumental variable approach to answer this question. The key
findings are that: a) emigrant households have higher overall consumption
expenditure as well as higher expenditure on food; b) we find that
international migration leads to increase in the dietary diversity of left
behind households. Further, we explore the effect on food sub-group expenditure
for both rural and urban households. We find that emigrant households spend
more on protein (milk, pulses and egg, fish and meat), at the same time there
is higher spending on non-healthy food habits (processed and ready to eat food
items) among them.

Conclusion: 三分制改革成功提升了英格兰足球联赛的竞争平衡，为体育规则改革提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Governing authorities in sports often make changes to rules and regulations
to increase competitiveness. One such change was made by the English Football
Association in 1981 when it changed the rule for awarding points in the
domestic league from two points for a win to three points. This study aims to
measure this rule change's impact on the domestic league's competitive balance
using a quasi-experimental estimation design of a synthetic control method. The
three-point rule change led to an increase in competitive balance in the
English League. Further, we show no significant change in the number of goals
scored per match.

incidence and returns to EOM depending on the reason to migrate, demographic
characteristics, and spatial factors. The study highlights the need of focusing
on EOM to increase the productivity benefits of migration. It also provides the
framework for minimizing migrants' likelihood of being mismatched while
maximizing their returns to education.

TL;DR: 该研究使用高频面板数据和固定效应事件研究法，分析了奥地利和德国对一次性塑料制品征收生产者费用后，这些成本向消费者价格的传导情况。研究发现奥地利存在明显的价格传导效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟2019/904指令后，奥地利和德国对一次性塑料制品引入生产者收费和基金支付机制，旨在覆盖清理成本。研究旨在量化这些成本如何传导至消费者价格。

Method: 使用包含价格的高频零售报价面板数据，采用固定效应事件研究法和双向聚类标准误，测量成本对消费者价格的传导程度。

Result: 奥地利产品汇总时，处理组产品在12个月内比非一次性塑料对照组高13.01个指数点(p<0.001)，在整个后期间高19.42个点(p<0.001)。气球产品显示强劲持久效应，杯子产品短期波动较大。

Conclusion: 奥地利对一次性塑料制品征收的生产者费用确实传导至消费者价格，但不同产品类别传导效果存在差异。

Abstract: Single-use plastics (SUPs) create large environmental costs. After Directive
(EU) 2019/904, Austria and Germany introduced producer charges and fund
payments meant to cover clean-up work. Using a high-frequency panel of retail
offer spells containing prices and a fixed-effects event study with two-way
clustered standard errors, this paper measures how much these costs drive up
consumer prices. We find clear price pass-through in Austria. When Austrian
products are pooled, treated items are 13.01 index points higher than non-SUP
controls within twelve months (DiD(12m); p<0.001) and 19.42 points over the
full post period (p<0.001). By product, balloons show strong and lasting
effects (DiD(12m)=13.43, p=0.007; Full DiD=19.96, p<0.001). Cups show mixed

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Conclusion: 多级预测系统使运营商能够更有效地管理电力负荷预测，提高电网可靠性，支持从区域到节点级预测的平稳过渡。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测变量的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释力，生成的特征子集可直接用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，在相关特征空间中表现出有效性。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ES-C51算法通过将C51中的贪婪Q学习更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，使用softmax结合所有可能动作的信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定性问题，在多个环境中表现优于QL-C51。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于价值的RL算法只估计每个动作的期望奖励，而分布强化学习(DRL)估计整个奖励概率分布。C51是离散动作空间的流行DRL算法，但使用贪婪Bellman更新时，当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，算法可能无法学习稳定分布。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，将C51的贪婪Q学习更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而非依赖单一最佳动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为对比基准(QL-C51)。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏上评估，ES-C51在多个环境中表现优于QL-C51。

Conclusion: 使用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新可以有效减少当动作具有相似期望奖励时的不稳定性，使智能体能够学习到性能更高的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，传统强化学习方法在这种条件下效果有限。

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自监督微调阶段学习世界模型，然后用于模拟未来状态以优化策略。

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中，SPA显著提升性能，如Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升到59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升到70.9%。

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型可以有效改善推理与环境动态的对齐，提升决策能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境是给定或固定的，但现实中的智能体可能具有主动改变环境动态的能力。通过重新配置底层转移过程，智能体有可能获得更高的奖励。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层MDP（配置模型改变动作）和下层MDP（具有非平稳转移函数的传统MDP）。智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 构建了一个允许智能体主动修改环境动态的理论框架，为研究具有模型改变能力的强化学习问题提供了基础。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP框架扩展了传统强化学习的边界，使智能体能够通过主动改变环境动态来优化长期奖励，为更灵活的智能体设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前双光子光刻系统的维护主要依赖经验而非科学的健康监测，导致维护时机不当——要么维护不及时造成机器停机和制造质量下降，要么过度维护导致效率低下和不必要的停机时间。

Result: 在所有测试场景中，所提出的方法都达到了高精度，展现了出色的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些成果为实现双光子光刻系统基于状态的维护迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个在线相关聚类算法，能在AOS模型中同时近似所有ℓ_p-范数目标，将离线的"全范数"保证扩展到在线设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于探索是否能在在线设置中实现离线环境下的强大特性——用单一聚类同时近似所有ℓ_p-范数目标。论文通过新的硬度结果证明了在标准随机顺序在线模型中，ℓ_1-范数和ℓ_∞-范数目标之间存在根本性分离，这凸显了需要超越最坏情况模型的必要性。

Method: 提出了一种在线带样本(AOS)模型的单一算法，给定输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，能够产生一个聚类。该算法在AOS模型中运行，利用样本信息来指导在线决策过程。

Result: 算法能够：以高概率同时对所有ℓ_p-范数达到O(log⁴ n)竞争比；以高概率对ℓ_∞-范数达到O(log n)竞争比；以期望值对ℓ_1-范数达到O(1)竞争比。同时证明了在标准RO模型中，任何ℓ_∞-范数算法的竞争比至少为Ω(n¹/³)。

Conclusion: 成功将离线的"全范数"保证扩展到在线世界，证明了AOS模型在解决相关聚类问题中的有效性，同时通过下界分析表明所获得的竞争比在AOS模型中几乎是紧的。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归和基于扩散的方法在预测高维PDE动力学时存在累积误差和离散化伪影问题，限制了长期物理一致性预测。流匹配提供了一种高效、确定性采样的替代方案。

Method: 提出TempO模型，利用稀疏条件化和通道折叠技术，使用时间条件化傅里叶层高效处理3D时空场，捕获多尺度模式。证明了FNO近似误差的上界。

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上优于最先进的基线方法，谱分析显示在多尺度动力学恢复方面表现优异，效率研究显示其参数和内存需求低于基于注意力或卷积的回归器。

Conclusion: TempO通过流匹配和创新的架构设计，实现了高效、准确的高维PDE动力学预测，在长期物理一致性预测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进强化学习优化方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持高准确率的同时大幅减少推理语言模型的输出长度，实现了最先进的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理语言模型生成过长输出、最大化每token智能度的问题，发现准确率下降不是由于惩罚机制复杂程度不够，而是强化学习优化不足。

Method: 提出DLER训练配方，结合批次奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号三大挑战。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少70%以上，同时超越所有先前基线准确率；DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B准确率提高28%且延迟更低；还提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过改进强化学习优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以有效平衡推理语言模型的准确率和效率，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算高效且无需过多调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大离散支撑集上估计多模态和重尾概率质量函数的问题，传统方法在处理这类分布时效果不佳。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯算子加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间得到平滑估计。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠快速，适合自动化流程和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失败模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Motivation: 研究恐怖主义事件短期预测，使用全球恐怖主义数据库(GTD)建立可复现的预测管道，评估深度学习模型相对于传统方法的性能。

Method: 构建基于固定时间分割的可复现管道，使用双向LSTM(BiLSTM)模型，并与季节性朴素、线性/ARIMA模型以及LSTM-Attention基线进行比较。

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上取得RMSE 6.38，比LSTM-Attention提升30.6%，比线性滞后回归基准提升35.4%的RMSE增益，MAE和MAPE也有并行改进。

Conclusion: 双向编码对于捕捉窗口内的累积和后续模式至关重要，长历史数据训练模型泛化能力最佳，中等回看窗口(20-30周)提供强上下文，短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Method: 研究策略迁移方法，在连续时间线性二次调节器（LQR）中利用熵正则化，提出了新的策略学习算法，并建立了与基于分数的扩散模型的联系。

Result: 证明了策略迁移在连续时间RL中的有效性，提出的算法实现了全局线性和局部超线性收敛，并推导了连续时间扩散模型的稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导出可处理的、自洽的平均场理论来描述贝叶斯后验分布，分析在有限宽度下网络与目标函数对齐的相变行为。

Result: 理论预测了对称性破缺相变，但基本平均场理论低估了相变后泛化性能的改善；引入自增强输入特征选择机制后，理论能定量匹配SGLD训练网络的学习曲线。

Conclusion: 自增强输入特征选择是特征学习中的关键机制，完善的平均场理论能够提供对特征学习过程的机理洞察。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Motivation: Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中广泛使用，但其性能受表示几何和归一化的影响尚未完全理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 进行了全面的实证研究，分析了不同图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案；提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，引入可调参数直接控制特征空间的径向几何。

Result: Mahalanobis方法并非普遍可靠；定义了理想的数据表示几何，证明谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型OOD性能；径向缩放ℓ2归一化能显著改善OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过弥合表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,

### [84] [ReasonIF: Large Reasoning Models Fail to Follow Instructions During Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15211)
*Yongchan Kwon,Shang Zhu,Federico Bianchi,Kaitlyn Zhou,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ReasonIF基准来评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型存在显著失败，并探索了多轮推理和指令微调两种改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究评估了模型主要回复中的指令遵循能力，但作者认为大型推理模型在整个推理过程中遵循用户指令同样重要，这能提高模型的可控性、透明度，并减少不良捷径、幻觉或奖励黑客的风险。

Method: 引入ReasonIF系统基准，包含六类指令提示（多语言推理、格式和长度控制等），评估多个开源大型推理模型，并探索多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种改进策略。

Result: 发现现有模型在推理指令遵循方面存在严重不足：最高指令遵循分数(IFS)低于0.25，意味着少于25%的推理轨迹符合给定指令。随着任务难度增加，指令遵循能力进一步下降。RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力存在显著缺陷，虽然RIF方法能带来可衡量的改进，但仍有很大的提升空间，需要进一步研究来增强推理指令的忠实度。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

### [85] [Soundness-Aware Level: A Microscopic Signature that Predicts LLM Reasoning Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15216)
*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究发现，不同基础模型在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）后的推理性能差异源于其内在的"合理性感知"能力。通过分析模型内部特征转换概率，提出了SAL指标来量化模型区分合理与不合理知识的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么不同预训练模型在RLVR后推理性能差异巨大，寻找影响推理能力的微观特性。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器提取潜在空间特征，估计特征间转换概率，并用LLM分类规则的语义合理性级别。

Result: 发现高性能模型具有合理性感知能力，其内部概率分布在不同的合理性级别上系统性地变化，而弱模型则对所有合理性级别都采用相同的分布。提出的SAL指标与RLVR后推理性能高度相关（R^2=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时区分合理与不合理知识的内在能力密切相关，这为选择和设计更强的基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 使用MIMIC-III数据库中的214名脑膜炎患者和46,303名非脑膜炎患者数据，通过集成学习方法构建脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊场景的测试集上取得了优异的性能（AUC分别为0.9637和0.9472）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建具有挑战性的脑膜炎诊断条件，模拟真实急诊室场景，为未来AI驱动的脑膜炎诊断方法铺平道路。

Method: 经过数据预处理和两阶段特征选择后，使用随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型进行集成学习，基础模型输出被堆叠到使用逻辑回归的元模型中。

Result: 在测试集1上AUC为0.9637，测试集2上AUC为0.9472，表现出优秀的建模性能。

Conclusion: 虽然直接将诊断工具部署给临床医生使用具有挑战性，但本文为使用集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法开辟了潜在途径。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.

*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

TL;DR: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，通过应力感知指数倾斜处理分布漂移下的序列决策问题，实现动态遗憾保证和鲁棒性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的序列决策问题，需要开发能够适应分布变化的鲁棒决策方法。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知指数倾斜，建立Fenchel对偶等价性，并分析鲁棒性指标。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度约束下获得$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$动态遗憾保证，实现了$O(1)$每切换遗憾。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，为应力自适应更新提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

TL;DR: FinTrust是一个专门评估金融领域LLM可信度的综合基准，关注实际应用中的对齐问题，包含细粒度任务评估。评估发现专有模型在安全性等方面表现更好，开源模型在特定领域有优势，但所有模型在法律意识方面都存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害关系特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM仍然具有挑战性，需要评估其可信度。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准，基于实际应用场景设计广泛的对齐问题，为每个可信度评估维度创建细粒度任务，并评估了11个LLM模型。

Result: 专有模型如o4-mini在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在特定领域（如行业级公平性）有优势，但所有模型在受托人对齐和披露等挑战性任务中都表现不佳，显示出法律意识方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

TL;DR: TESSERA是一种新的不确定性量化方法，通过结合专家混合模型和保形校准，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间，在分布偏移下仍能保持接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖宽度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体亲和力预测面临检测噪声异质性、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合了专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供具有可靠覆盖保证的逐样本不确定性，以及信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度，能够跟踪绝对误差。

Result: 在独立同分布和基于支架的分布外分割下，TESSERA实现了接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖宽度权衡（通过CWC衡量），同时保持竞争性的适应性（最低AUSE）。SSC进一步确认区间大小合适，在数据稀缺或噪声时宽度增加，在预测可靠时保持紧凑。

Conclusion: 通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，TESSERA提供了可信、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，非常适合药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策制定。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证任务上扩展思维链推理有效，但在更普遍的非可验证任务（人类偏好对形式）上仍具挑战且研究不足。

Method: DWRL通过实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数两个互补权重，近似BT模型的最大似然目标，训练生成式偏好模型先产生思维再预测偏好分数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL一致优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯可解释的思维。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗评估下显著提升提示的可靠性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示搜索方法在单一评估分布下优化期望性能，导致在分布偏移和对抗评估时性能下降，提示难以迁移到不同场景。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化改写、代码调试和翻译任务中，准确率显著提升：形式化改写从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务保持96%以上性能。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习结合，为现实世界不确定性下的可靠、可迁移提示对齐提供了即插即用的通用方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了μP在稳态训练中学习率传递失效的问题，实现了跨宽度的零超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成反向尺度敏感性，导致有效学习率变得宽度依赖，破坏了μP的学习率传递能力。

Method: 引入AdamW的权重衰减缩放规则，保持子层增益跨宽度不变。通过观察奇异值谱的缩放规律，推导出经验性权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，与μP学习率规则η₂∝d⁻¹结合，实现子层增益宽度不变。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，提供了匹配顶部奇异值的简单诊断方法检查子层增益不变性。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设置的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数传递提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sxq/Heteroscedastic-Pseudo-Labels.

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化向新科学范式的过渡，需要社区反思科学发现的未来

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法比传统EnKF在相同集合规模下获得更高精度，且额外计算成本可忽略

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法通过机器学习增强传统数据同化，在保持计算效率的同时显著提高精度，且具有良好适应性

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA展示了在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的实用性和鲁棒性，为处理客户端异构数据提供了有效的去中心化解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 传统的随机特征模型需要大量特征才能达到良好性能，本文旨在通过数据依赖的采样方案减少所需特征数量，提高学习效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案生成特征，提出了寻找近似核并应用杠杆加权采样的算法来学习加权RFLAF。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数量边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进到~Ω((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至可达到Ω(1)；Lipschitz损失边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进到~Ω((1/ε²)^{1/t})。实验验证了加权RFLAF能用更少特征达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的加权采样方案能显著减少随机特征模型所需特征数量，提供了迄今为止最尖锐的理论边界，为高效学习随机特征模型提供了理论保证和实用方法。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法为序列建模提供了新的算子理论视角，通过谱分解和梯度流技术实现了可扩展和高效的建模。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效提升了零样本强化学习的性能表现。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available
at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.

Conclusion: SWFP框架通过流分解实现了预训练流策略的高效稳定微调，具有训练简单快速、计算内存成本低和基于Wasserstein信任区域的可证明稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Motivation: 解决深度Transformer模型带来的训练时间长、推理延迟高、资源受限设备不实用等问题，挑战'越深越好'的哲学观念。

Method: 将标准Transformer建模为闭式函数逼近器，通过理论分析发现性能依赖于层间协作而非深度本身。ParaFormer通过并行分支结构实现层间协作，每个新分支进一步减少前序分支的损失，实现渐进逼近。

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信仰'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径，证明了层间协作不一定需要顺序结构。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Motivation: 尽管采样式测试时扩展方法在实践中取得了成功，但其理论基础仍然不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，为理解这些方法的理论机制提供框架。

Method: 提出了RPC混合方法，包含两个关键组件：困惑度一致性（结合自一致性和困惑度的优势）和推理剪枝（消除低概率推理路径）。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实证结果表明，RPC在保持与自一致性相当推理性能的同时，不仅提升了置信度可靠性，还将采样成本降低了50%。

Conclusion: RPC方法通过理论指导的混合策略，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在减少推理错误方面展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于鞍点问题的隐变量能量基模型训练方法，通过耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行最大似然训练，无需判别器或辅助网络。


<details>

Motivation: 隐变量能量基模型能够同时进行表达性生成建模和捕捉隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性。本文旨在开发一种无需判别器或辅助网络的训练框架。

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为隐变量和联合流形分布上的鞍点问题，使用过阻尼Langevin更新联合负池和条件隐变量粒子，结合随机参数上升。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上获得衰减率。在物理系统数值逼近上的评估表现与可比方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的鞍点视角提供了比受限摊销后验获得的边界更严格的ELBO，为隐变量能量基模型训练提供了一种有效且理论保证的方法。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在多个正确答案的情况下，传统基于低复杂度策略类假设的最大似然估计方法可能失效，需要更弱的假设条件。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文多臂老虎机中的离线模仿学习，基于奖励模型属于低基数类的假设，设计了一种样本复杂度与奖励类基数对数相关的新算法。

Result: 证明了最大似然方法在此设定下可能失败，而新方法在样本复杂度上具有对数优势。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越传统的似然最大化方法，采用基于奖励模型低基数假设的新方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Motivation: 解决在存在分配偏差情况下的反事实预测问题，避免传统对抗性训练的不稳定性和调参负担。

Method: 学习一个随机表示Z，在预测结果的同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在受控数值模拟和真实临床数据集上评估，在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗性方案训练不稳定性的同时，在多个评估指标上表现优异，可自然扩展到动态设置。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Motivation: 传统强化学习需要手动开发模拟器和定义奖励函数，这通常耗时费力。

Method: 联合优化高熵转移模型和IRL奖励函数，增强探索性和奖励泛化能力；提出OffSim+扩展，在多数据集设置中引入边际奖励。

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，OffSim相比现有离线IRL方法取得显著性能提升，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励结构，实现高效的离线策略训练，无需真实环境交互。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了SESA（顺序采样）框架，通过顺序生成多样化的解决方案草图来缓解强化学习中探索不足和熵崩溃问题，显著提升了LLMs的推理多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时存在探索有限和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。并行采样方法会加剧这一问题。

Method: SESA框架通过顺序采样生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将它们扩展为完整的推理路径。通过将每个新输出基于先前输出进行条件化，确保更广泛的探索，促进过程多样性并防止策略崩溃。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面始终优于传统RL方法。在三个智能体基准测试中，SESA将成功率分别提升了+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相对于基线RL最高达211%的相对改进）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了一种结构化方法，为RL训练的LLMs中更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用PMI的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态的最优相似度度量应对应点互信息。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论上可以任意精度逼近点互信息。

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中，KME-CLIP总体上优于标准CLIP方法。

Conclusion: 利用PMI的线性结构可以显著提升多模态对比学习性能，KME-CLIP为相似度计算提供了更优的理论基础。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文证明Transformer语言模型是单射的，即不同的输入序列会映射到不同的连续表示，因此可以从隐藏激活中精确恢复输入文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）本质上是非单射的，可能阻止从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先数学证明Transformer语言模型在离散输入到连续表示的映射中是单射的；其次通过数十亿次碰撞测试在六个最先进语言模型上验证；最后提出SipIt算法，可证明且高效地从隐藏激活重建精确输入文本。

Result: 理论证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，未观察到任何碰撞；SipIt算法在实践中实现了精确可逆性，具有线性时间保证。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Conclusion: 数据集大小可能是支撑蒸馏机制的一个基本但被忽视的变量，对理解知识蒸馏的工作原理具有重要意义。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

Motivation: 研究MC Dropout不确定性是否能有效识别脑肿瘤MRI分割中的错误，特别是在肿瘤边界区域。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并与像素级误差进行Pearson和Spearman相关性分析。

Result: 全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05），不同增强设置间的差异虽有统计显著性但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供有限线索，需要开发替代或混合的不确定性估计方法用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后网络第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均值(AGOP)之间的关系，需要深入分析其在不同网络架构中的有效性。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化，理论分析多层线性网络中NFA的成立条件；研究不平衡初始化下权重衰减的影响；通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 对于L≥2层的线性网络，NFA在训练过程中始终成立且指数α=1/L；不平衡初始化下应用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立；某些非线性网络架构中即使训练拟合良好，NFA也不成立。

Conclusion: NFA的成立具有深度依赖性，在特定条件下对线性网络有效，但对非线性网络存在局限性，这为理解深度网络特征学习机制提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Motivation: 受迭代连接图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法改进#SAT问题的求解准确性。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为连接图，在连接图上执行迭代消息传递，通过注意力机制在簇内和簇间增强关键变量和簇的关注度，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型相比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: Attn-JGNN模型通过结合注意力机制和连接图神经网络，有效提升了#SAT问题的求解精度。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化技术，在保持精度的前提下显著降低语义top-K选择的延迟和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义top-K选择在边缘设备上的延迟和内存需求过高，阻碍了设备端AI服务的部署。研究发现相对排名比精确分数更重要，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为剪枝提供了机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播方法，通过渐进式聚类剪枝减少延迟，采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略来限制峰值内存使用，实现I/O与计算的战略重叠。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上测试，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存减少达94.9%，在三个真实设备端AI应用中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存减少18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING在保持精度的同时显著提升了设备端语义top-K选择的效率和可部署性，为边缘AI服务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CQD-SHAP框架，使用Shapley值计算复杂查询中各部分对答案排名的贡献，提高神经符号复杂查询回答的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号复杂查询回答方法虽然可追踪中间结果，但无法解释查询各部分的重要性，这会影响用户信任。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算查询各部分对答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释的自动评估中，该方法对大多数查询类型都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP框架成功解释了神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，相比仅依赖现有事实的符号方法具有优势。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

coin-betting that simplifies the multi-agent regret analysis. Our analysis
shows sublinear network regret bounds and is validated through experiments on
synthetic and real datasets. This family of algorithms is applicable to
distributed sensing, decentralized optimization, and collaborative ML
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了NODE-ONet框架，结合神经ODE和算子学习，通过物理编码机制增强PDE求解的泛化能力和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽视PDE的领域知识，导致难以捕捉时间动态且在训练时间范围外泛化能力差

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：空间离散化编码器、捕捉潜在时间动态的神经ODE、物理空间重构解码器，并提出物理编码神经ODE

Result: 在非线性扩散反应和Navier-Stokes方程上的数值实验显示高精度、计算高效性和超出训练时间范围的预测能力

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应不同编码器/解码器的灵活性，能跨相关PDE族泛化，是科学机器学习中可扩展的物理编码工具

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出了基于位运算的Tsetlin机器高效软件实现，通过早期退出机制和文字重排序策略，在ARM处理器上实现高达96.71%的推理时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin机器在资源受限设备上具有高速推理潜力，其逻辑驱动操作适合现代CPU架构的并行执行，但传统整数实现效率不高。

Method: 使用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理，引入基于AND子句评估的早期退出机制，并通过统计分析提出文字重排序策略。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的实验显示，推理时间相比传统整数实现减少96.71%，同时保持相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 提出的优化实现显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理效率，适用于资源受限设备，且重排序策略在训练后推理前阶段应用，运行时开销可忽略。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法无关模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且难以扩展到更多输入的逻辑块，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh变换辅助的概率查找表(WARP-LUTs)，大幅减少可训练参数数量，实现高效的逻辑门组合学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，WARP-LUTs相比DLGNs收敛速度显著更快，同时保持可比的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为在FPGA上高效部署和实时科学应用提供了潜力，支持扩展到更高输入逻辑块的研究。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来引导生成更可靠的推理路径，无需重新训练大语言模型，在数学推理任务上显著提高了采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法（如Best-of-N采样）在N增加时收益递减，存在效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段方法CarBoN：先探索解空间，然后通过学习输入特定的温度T和加性偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024数据集上，CarBoN效率提升显著，达到相同准确率所需的采样次数减少4倍，且在固定预算下通常获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效解决了测试时采样的效率问题，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，该框架也适用于束搜索等步级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

TL;DR: 使用机器学习方法基于电磁参数对IPMSM转子形状进行分类，作为传统有限元方法的替代方案。Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM达到100%准确率，KS-Net模型达到99.98%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要开发更快速、成本更低的替代方法。

Method: 使用自定义深度学习模型KS-Net与多种传统机器学习算法比较，在包含9,000个样本的平衡数据集上采用10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法完美分类所有样本，准确率100%；KS-Net模型准确率99.98%，仅有两个误分类。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为加速电机设计过程、开发自动化转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供了基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略了领域特定的特征关系约束，导致生成的对抗样本在现实应用中不可信或容易被检测。

Method: 使用增强拉格朗日最小最大优化框架，结合梯度交替优化策略来强制执行多个复杂约束。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间。

Conclusion: CAP方法能够有效处理约束特征空间中的对抗攻击，并可直接从数据中学习特征约束，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，通过专家迭代和强化学习训练，在标准基准测试中显著压缩证明长度（miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，IMO 2025证明减少49%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明虽然经过形式系统验证，但长度过长难以理解，限制了数学洞察力。证明简化是关键瓶颈，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer语言模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程逐步减少证明长度

Result: ProofOptimizer显著压缩了最先进RL训练证明器生成的证明，在miniF2F上减少87%，PutnamBench上减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明上减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中检查更快，作为监督微调训练数据时还能进一步提升下游证明器性能

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer成功解决了神经定理证明中证明过长的问题，通过无监督方法显著简化证明，不仅提高可读性，还提升了证明检查效率和下游证明器性能

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

TL;DR: ProSh是一种基于风险增强的概率屏蔽模型无关安全强化学习算法，通过在约束MDP状态空间中添加风险预算，使用学习到的成本评论器对策略分布施加屏蔽，确保所有采样动作在期望上保持安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中的安全问题，开发不仅性能最优且能提供形式化安全保证的RL系统，确保部署安全性。

Method: 在约束MDP状态空间中添加风险预算，使用学习到的成本评论器对智能体策略分布施加屏蔽，确保采样动作在期望上安全。在确定性环境中保持最优性。

Result: 提供了仅依赖于备份评论器准确度的成本期望紧上界，该上界在训练期间始终满足。在实践可实现的温和假设下，ProSh即使在训练时也能保证安全性。

Conclusion: ProSh是一种有效的模型无关安全强化学习方法，能够提供形式化的安全保证，在训练和部署阶段都能确保系统安全性。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要手动设计奖励函数，这既困难又低效。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)结构生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包含静态方法（直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化）和动态方法（通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法在具有时间依赖性的任务上优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法（如奖励机器和LTL引导方法）。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法为处理非马尔可夫奖励提供了一种可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，并提供了收敛性保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，需要寻找深度学习模型作为替代方案，但选择合适的架构来准确模拟FEA具有挑战性。

Method: 使用图神经网络和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，采用课程学习策略（先数据预训练后物理信息微调）来稳定训练。

Result: GNN显著优于U-Net，GCN相对L2误差8.7%，U-Net最佳为13.0%。MPNN和Graph Transformer分别达到3.5%和2.6%的误差。物理信息神经网络将高信号任务的误差降低了11.3%。Graph Transformer最准确但推理速度比MPNN慢37.5%。

Conclusion: PINN增强的MPNN提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

TL;DR: PoultryFI是一个模块化、经济实惠的AI平台，集成了六个AI模块，用于家禽养殖场的持续监测、预测和优化，通过低成本传感、边缘分析和规范性AI提升动物福利和盈利能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小型家禽养殖场缺乏经济实惠的集成工具进行持续监测和决策制定，主要依赖手动、反应式检查，难以同时满足生产力目标、动物福利和环境合规要求。

Method: 开发了包含六个AI模块的集成平台：相机布局优化器、视听监测、分析与警报、实时鸡蛋计数、生产与盈利预测、推荐模块。使用进化算法优化相机布局，通过同步视频、音频和喂食数据提取福利指标，采用边缘视觉模型自动化生产跟踪。

Result: 现场试验显示在树莓派5上实现100%鸡蛋计数准确率，具有强大的异常检测能力和可靠的短期预测能力。

Conclusion: PoultryFI填补了孤立试点工具与可扩展农场智能之间的差距，使生产者能够主动保障动物福利和盈利能力。

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了在现实多变量和协变量场景中的应用。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出SNOO优化器，通过将Nesterov动量应用于Lookahead优化器的伪梯度，在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中表现出色，研究发现其有效性主要源于将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，这启发了开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，在Lookahead两环框架中，对多个内优化器步骤产生的伪梯度应用Nesterov动量来更新慢权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中达到1.5-2.5倍计算效率提升，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增加，最高可达1e23训练FLOPs规模。

Conclusion: SNOO因其最小的计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为适用于包括AdamW和Muon在内的各种内优化器的实用增强方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出一种混合求解器，结合优化代理和经典求解器，通过对偶理论保证预测的最优性差距，在无法认证最优性时回退到经典求解器，实现速度与最优性的可解释权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化代理虽然平均最优性差距低于1%，但最坏情况下可能产生数量级更高的差距，难以在实际中信任预测结果。需要在经典求解器和优化代理之间找到平衡，实现可信部署。

Method: 提出混合求解器，利用对偶理论高效地界定预测的最优性差距边界；提出结合原始和对偶代理训练的替代训练程序以提高混合求解器的加速效果。

Result: 在大规模传输系统上的实验表明，混合求解器具有高度可扩展性，相比并行化单纯形求解器实现了超过1000倍的加速，同时保证最大最优性差距为2%。

Conclusion: 混合求解器成功实现了速度与最优性的平衡，提供了基于用户定义最优性阈值的可解释权衡，为优化代理的可信部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Motivation: 当前量子设备受噪声影响，可靠性降低。量子计算中关键挑战是在转换过程（特别是路由阶段）提高量子电路的过程保真度。

Method: FIDDLE框架包含两个模块：基于高斯过程的代理模型（用有限训练样本估计过程保真度）和强化学习模块（优化路由）。这是首个直接最大化过程保真度的方法。

Result: 我们的代理模型比现有学习技术提供更好的过程保真度估计，端到端框架在各种噪声模型下显著提高了量子电路的过程保真度。

Conclusion: FIDDLE框架成功解决了路由阶段保真度最大化问题，通过直接优化过程保真度而非间接指标，显著提升了量子电路的可靠性。

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Motivation: 解决跨物种转录组数据利用不足的问题，提供基于生物学基础的、可解释的跨物种迁移学习方法。

Method: 构建物种间二分图表示同源关系，在预训练神经网络前添加物种转换层，其权重由二分图的邻接矩阵掩码，学习源到目标物种基因表达的线性变换。

Result: TRON能够有效进行跨物种知识转移，转换层的权重可用于解释功能同源性，揭示不同物种基因对表型的贡献。

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供了生物学基础和可解释性，有望更有效地利用现有转录组数据，目前正在收集数据以获得实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计和概率推理能力的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型产生的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要在信息不完整的情况下进行不确定性推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 开发了OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型合成背景信息并表达概率先验的能力，评估这些先验的准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的测试表明，模型产生的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信，性能对不确定性获取方式有轻微改善，但基本不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，并为开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅靠观察充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观察等价的世界在干预下可能产生分歧，需要理论突破来解决AGI发展的根本限制。

Method: 提出因果力学框架，将假设空间变化作为核心操作，引入局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制和组合自主性原则，提供可操作的诊断工具来发现和纠正不可达错误。

Result: 建立了理论框架和结构原则，使错误发现和修正变得可处理，为构建能够将不可达错误转化为可达错误并修正的系统提供了基础。

Conclusion: AGI进展需要理论创新而非单纯的数据扩展，因果力学框架通过强调假设空间演化和错误中心方法，为解决干预能力问题提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Conclusion: HugAgent为将机器推理与人类思维的个体性对齐提供了首个可扩展的基准测试框架。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,

Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，而人类智能研究表明并非如此；快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。

Method: 提出两种评估扩展：基于因果中心性的权重评分（导入CHC衍生权重），以及集群稳定性指数系列（评估配置持久性、持久学习和错误纠正）。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了无需架构访问的黑盒协议。

Conclusion: 通用智能应被理解为稳态属性集群，AGI评估需要衡量能力在扰动下的持久性，而不仅仅是快照表现。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM代理与知识图谱交互的多维数据分析方法，构建动态协作的分析生态系统，用于产品生态系统分析和关系挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量、异构、复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLM存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱静态特性限制动态交互能力。

Method: 利用LLM代理从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索分析。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动的探索性分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过将像素级GUI交互构建为状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，解决LLM智能体在无API环境中的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI操作，导致决策短视、依赖试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 构建状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，链接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态，设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和新颖性奖励。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂GUI决策环境中，相比最先进方法显著提升了探索效率和战略深度。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过结构化经验表示和混合奖励机制，有效解决了无API环境中智能体的探索效率和长期规划问题。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AUGUSTUS是一个多模态智能体系统，受人类记忆启发，使用图结构多模态上下文记忆和语义标签进行概念驱动的检索，在ImageNet分类和MSC基准测试中表现优于传统多模态RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体系统主要存储文本信息，忽略了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆的多模态特性启发，希望开发一个更符合认知科学原理的多模态记忆系统。

Method: 系统包含4个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）、行动（执行任务）。使用语义标签概念化信息，并将其与上下文关联存储在图形结构的多模态上下文记忆中，实现高效的概念驱动检索。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中表现优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS证明了基于认知科学原理的多模态记忆系统的有效性，通过图结构记忆和语义标签实现了比传统方法更高效的概念驱动检索。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

TL;DR: VERITAS是一个通过整合视觉先验和多个先进LMM来提升SFT数据质量的系统化流程，利用统计方法融合多个LMM的评估结果，训练轻量级评论模型，显著提升多模态模型在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT数据增强方法因视觉感知不足而存在事实错误和幻觉问题，需要系统化解决方案来提升多模态模型训练数据的质量。

Method: 整合视觉识别模型(RAM++)和OCR系统(PP-OCRv4)提取结构化视觉先验，使用三个LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合获得高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级评论模型(GRPO)，各LMM基于评论生成候选答案并选择最优答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能始终优于使用原始数据的模型，特别是在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务上。评论模型能力接近先进LMM但效率显著更高。

Conclusion: VERITAS有效提升了SFT数据质量，显著改善多模态模型性能，为多模态数据优化研究提供了有价值的工具和资源。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但存在响应过长和过度思考问题，导致推理延迟和计算消耗增加，特别是对于简单任务。

Method: 提出DEPO框架，包含三个核心组件：优势解耦算法指导减少无效token、难度感知长度惩罚降低整体响应长度、优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO使序列长度减少39%，减少无效token中的过度推理路径，同时整体准确性优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO能有效减少模型的不必要推理，在保持准确性的同时显著降低响应长度和计算消耗。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Motivation: 模拟集成电路布局受电气和特定问题约束限制，且布局规划与布线步骤相互依赖，现有机器学习方法难以满足工业标准。布局工程师需要现成的布线感知布局解决方案。

Method: 使用强化学习和关系图卷积神经网络构建自动布局引擎，结合高网格分辨率、精确引脚信息集成和动态布线资源估计技术，平衡布线效率和面积利用率。

Result: 与之前基于学习的最先进技术相比，在模拟环境中实现了13.8%的死区减少、40.6%的线长减少和73.4%的布线成功率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成更易布线的布局结果，满足工业标准要求，显著改善了模拟集成电路的布局规划质量。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了可修正性目标的概念，通过一种转换方法使任何目标都能在不牺牲性能的情况下变得可修正，从而避免AI在训练过程中抵制目标更新或关闭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在部分学习目标后往往会抵制进一步的目标更新，因为继续追求现有目标通常能更好地实现目标。可修正性对于训练收敛、纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化至关重要。

Method: 提供了可修正性的形式化定义，引入了一种转换方法，通过近视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测来构建可修正版本的目标。该方法还可递归扩展到新创建的代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验证明，这些可修正目标可以有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种使AI目标具有可修正性的方法，这对于AI安全至关重要，同时保持与非可修正替代方案的竞争力。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对单智能体任务，在多轮次、多智能体场景中面临长期信用分配和智能体特定优势估计的挑战，需要开发专门的多智能体强化学习框架。

Conclusion: 在战略游戏中通过自博弈进行端到端强化学习是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as

relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent

Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational

Motivation: 传统方法在强化学习中面临判断不一致问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题尚未得到充分解决，这会影响强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 引入CDR指标量化判断冲突，提出DGR框架：构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图(DAG)、生成逻辑一致的奖励信号，兼容任何策略优化器。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架相比强基线显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中关键且现在可管理的维度，该框架为解决判断不一致问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降，需要更可靠的电机故障诊断方案。

Method: MM-HCAN框架集成对比学习和超图拓扑，专门设计用于多模态传感器融合，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为综合多故障诊断提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和资产寿命延长。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个用于Text-to-SQL任务中候选查询选择的框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识机制解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL方法在测试时扩展时面临选择正确查询的瓶颈，现有选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）只能提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱的推理链，无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: JudgeSQL开发了基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹，实现准确且可解释的判断。在此基础上，加权共识锦标赛机制整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制重新定义了SQL候选选择，提供了更可靠和高效的查询选择方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，通过整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别适用于就诊次数有限且频率不规律的情况。该模型首先基于最近一次就诊数据评估初始疾病风险，然后利用历史影像和临床生物标志物信息进行精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化至关重要，特别是在就诊次数有限且频率不规律的情况下，需要有效整合历史信息来改进健康监测。

Method: 模型首先使用最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险，然后通过消化先前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物信息来精炼这一评估。应用于前列腺癌风险预测，使用近十年收集的大规模数据。

Result: 整合历史背景直接将假阳性转化为真阴性，在保持高灵敏度的同时提高了整体特异性。当整合多达三次先前影像检查信息时，假阳性率从51%逐步降至33%，当包括先前临床数据时进一步降至24%。预测五年内前列腺癌风险时，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，增强了医学风险预测的特异性。对于广泛的进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率可以为扩展纵向健康监测计划提供途径，实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了SciRecipe数据集和Thoth模型，通过"Sketch-and-Fill"范式和结构化奖励机制，显著提升了科学实验协议生成的完整性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型生成科学实验协议时的不完整和不一致问题，提高科学复现的效率。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集，提出"Sketch-and-Fill"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度，并通过分阶段的Knowledge-to-Action过程训练Thoth模型。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够将知识与实验执行连接起来。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Conclusion: 通过提供构建可定制合作科学家系统的架构原则和实际实现，促进自动化研究在科学领域的更广泛采用，使从业者能够部署交互式多智能体系统进行端到端研究。

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 本文针对RLHF和DPO方法中忽略人类评估者多样性和成对反馈局限性的问题，提出了基于排名反馈的偏好学习方法和处理异质偏好的对齐算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性，需要解决这两个关键问题。

Method: 1) 将偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好；2) 开发DPO的EM变体，发现潜在标注者类型并训练LLM混合模型；3) 提出基于最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中面向多样化用户的公平性和个性化理论算法框架，确保可识别性和公平性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过排名反馈和异质偏好整合，为生成模型对齐提供了更完善的公平性和个性化解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise
environments.

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略处理模态内不平衡问题

Result: 在三个公共数据集上，异步设置下比最佳基线提升16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，同步设置下提升4.86和2.30个百分点

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中表现出卓越的有效性和适应性，解决了多模态学习的实际应用限制

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维度问题（如司法框架、环境污染、疫情韧性等）时，现有大型语言模型缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制。

Method: 开发Dialectica框架，让代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，通过记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑来增强能力，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 在两个模型架构（Qwen3:30b和o4-mini）上的实验显示，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo分数、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现目标专业知识放大的实用路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.
