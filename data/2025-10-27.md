### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理方法，显著提升了语言模型在战略决策对话任务中的信息寻求能力，使较弱模型在协作战舰游戏中能超越人类和前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高风险AI应用需要形成数据驱动假设和做出针对性猜测，但现有语言模型在理性信息寻求方面存在不足，特别是在平衡探索与行动方面。

Method: 引入协作战舰游戏作为基准任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，包括提升观察者代理准确性和船长代理预期信息增益的方法。

Result: 观察者代理准确率提升14.7%，船长代理信息增益提升0.227比特，组合方法使较弱模型在协作战舰游戏中胜率从8%提升至82%，在猜猜谁游戏中准确率提升28.3-42.4个百分点。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯实验设计的推理方法能显著提升语言模型在战略信息寻求任务中的理性表现，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少样本引导学习，使标准指令微调语言模型无需额外训练即可达到或超越专门推理模型的性能，同时显著提高token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型虽然成功但需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高且缓慢。研究发现标准指令语言模型本身已具备强大推理能力，只需合适引导即可发挥。

Method: CodeAdapt方法结合CodeAct框架（语言模型交替进行自然语言推理和代码执行）和少样本引导上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型-推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），token效率提高10-81%，在六个任务上四个模型平均表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础扎实的强大系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FICSIM是一个用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究中应用的长篇小说相似性数据集，包含12个相似性维度的评分，由作者提供元数据并经数字人文学者验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前嵌入相似性数据集不适合评估文学领域任务，因为它们主要关注粗粒度的相似性和非常短的文本，而长篇小说评估面临细粒度标注成本高和数据污染的问题。

Method: 收集近期创作的长篇小说，基于作者提供的元数据构建12个相似性维度的评分，并通过数字人文学者验证，在数据收集过程中优先考虑作者自主权并依赖持续知情同意。

Result: 评估了一系列嵌入模型，发现模型倾向于关注表面特征而非对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集填补了文学领域评估的空白，揭示了当前嵌入模型在理解文学语义方面的局限性，为计算文学研究提供了更合适的评估基准。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案件推翻关系中的表现，发现存在时代敏感性、浅层推理和上下文相关推理失败三大局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文基准测试大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法反映真实世界文档理解的复杂性。推翻关系是普通法体系的基础，为评估长文档法律理解提供了重要测试平台

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型识别美国最高法院案件中的推翻关系

Result: 模型表现出三个关键局限：对历史案例性能下降的时代敏感性；依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解的浅层推理；在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能关系的上下文相关推理失败

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个解决现实长上下文评估关键差距的基准测试，创建了反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的评估环境

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 爱尔兰-BLiMP是首个为爱尔兰语设计的语言能力评估数据集和框架，包含1020个最小对比对，涵盖11种语言特征。评估显示人类在所有语言特征上都优于大语言模型，准确率高出16.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为濒危语言爱尔兰语创建首个系统性的语言能力评估基准，填补低资源语言在语言模型评估方面的空白。

Method: 基于语言学文献和语法参考书，由流利的爱尔兰语使用者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对比对，涵盖11种语言特征。评估现有大语言模型和人类参与者的句法知识。

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，平均准确率高16.6%。开源和闭源大语言模型之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强模型准确率仅73.5%，而人类达到90.1%。人类和模型在爱尔兰语语法的不同方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估大语言模型在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，为低资源语言的语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了置信度门控的思维链方法，当模型对直接答案置信度低时才启用推理，以减少不必要的token使用。通过系统评估四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，发现现有方法能减少冗余推理，但效果因数据集和模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但过度推理会增加token使用且不必要。现有模型允许控制推理长度，但缺乏何时使用思维链的明确指导。

Method: 使用置信度门控思维链，当模型对直接答案置信度低时才启用推理。系统评估了四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，并与随机基准和全知oracle对比。

Result: 现有无需训练置信度方法能减少冗余思维链使用，优于随机调用。但不同置信度方法的效果不一致，受数据集和模型影响较大。

Conclusion: 置信度门控思维链有潜力减少不必要推理，但当前方法的可靠性有限，需要更可靠的自适应门控方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of Sports Play-by-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21034)
*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究量化了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要中幻觉和事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成的文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）生成NBA比赛摘要，手动标注了3,312个事实错误。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入减少69%（Llama）和65%（Qwen）的错误，行结构输入减少54%（Llama）和51%（Qwen）的错误。

Conclusion: 输入结构解释了错误率80%以上的方差，所有输入格式之间的差异都具有统计显著性，结构化数据能显著减少LLM生成内容的事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 推理虽然能提高大语言模型的整体准确率，但在低误报率要求的精确敏感任务中表现不佳，而无需推理的模式在严格精度要求下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理在严格低误报率(FPR)机制下对分类任务的适用性，特别是在安全检测和幻觉检测等精度敏感应用中。

Method: 系统研究推理在分类任务中的表现，涵盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLM和大型推理模型(LRM)，比较推理增强(Think On)和无推理(Think Off)模式。

Result: 推理增强生成提高整体准确率，但在低FPR阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分优于自我表达置信度；两种模式的简单集成能恢复各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [9] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和筛选演示示例来实现上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，适用于黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有上下文知识编辑方法中存在的数量-质量权衡问题和对任务难度缺乏适应性的问题。

Method: 训练BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准上，编辑成功率提升17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持对无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM提供了有效的梯度无关编辑方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将自适应检索增强生成(RAG)系统应用于印尼语问答，通过问题复杂度分类器选择回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，而印尼语等低资源语言缺乏相应支持的问题。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，包含问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强以克服印尼语数据集有限的挑战。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了低资源语言问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CDrugRed，首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集，专注于代谢疾病的出院用药推荐，包含5,894条去标识化记录，并评估了多个大语言模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是非英语数据集，阻碍了此类系统的发展。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条去标识化记录的CDrugRed数据集，涵盖患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多个最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，监督微调能提高模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更稳健准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.
The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过自奖励机制实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，提升LLM的泛化能力和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。需要一种能够克服这些限制的微调方法。

Method: 结合SFT和PPO，设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现自奖励机制，无需人工偏好标注即可进行在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景下。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SFT的局限性，提高了LLM的泛化性能、数据效率和鲁棒性，为使用演示数据对齐LLM提供了更有效的途径。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的忠实性标注框架VeriGray，通过引入Out-Dependent类别来解决摘要生成中外部知识验证的标注模糊问题，构建了新的不忠实检测基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM忠实性基准存在标注模糊问题，主要由于生成输出中允许的外部知识边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出包含Out-Dependent类别的忠实性标注框架，构建VeriGray基准来检测摘要中的不忠实内容。

Result: 统计显示即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对于不忠实检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

*Ning Bian,Xianpei Han,Hongyu Lin,Baolei Wu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在偏差，无法真实再现人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，形成缺乏真实复杂性的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统分析LLMs在社交模拟中的行为，评估其与真实人类行为的差异，以避免科学研究和实际应用中的误解和意外后果。

Method: 通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，以检验涌现的社交认知偏差。

Result: 实验发现LLMs表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极性偏差，无法忠实再现真实人类行为。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础的LLMs，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试资源有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上的性能比较。

Method: 创建基于7个多样化数据集的评估基准，所有数据均来自爱沙尼亚语原生来源，评估了6个基础模型和26个指令调优模型，采用人工评估和LLM-as-a-judge方法。

Result: 人工评估分数与基准评估呈中等到高度相关，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM裁判与人工评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 高性能LLM可以有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型的评估工作。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于临床分类法和大型语言模型的多智能体系统，用于模拟紧急医疗调度场景，通过医生评估和自动语言分析验证了系统的高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度面临呼叫者困扰、模糊性和认知负荷等挑战，大型语言模型和多智能体系统为增强调度员能力提供了机会。

Method: 构建了包含32种主诉和6种呼叫者身份的临床分类法，开发了基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，包含呼叫者和调度员智能体，使用混合评估框架（医生评估+自动语言分析）。

Result: 系统表现出色：调度有效性94%，指导有效性91%，情感中性（73.7%中性情感），高可读性（Flesch 80.9），礼貌风格（60%礼貌，0%不礼貌）。

Conclusion: 基于分类法的多智能体系统能够高保真地模拟多样化的临床合理调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持，为AI智能体安全集成到应急响应工作流程提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

TL;DR: 提出使用相关维度（一种分形几何度量）来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，该方法能揭示预训练阶段、反映上下文依赖复杂性、指示幻觉倾向，并检测生成文本的退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得显著进展，但仍表现出重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为，即使困惑度较低。这凸显了传统评估指标的局限性，即强调局部预测准确性而忽略了长程结构复杂性。

Method: 引入相关维度作为分形几何度量，用于量化语言模型感知的文本自相似性。该方法捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中桥接局部和全局属性。

Result: 实验表明，相关维度能够：(1) 揭示预训练过程中的三个不同阶段；(2) 反映上下文依赖的复杂性；(3) 指示模型的幻觉倾向；(4) 可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于多种自回归架构。

Conclusion: 相关维度为LLMs的生成动态提供了新的见解，是一种有效的文本复杂性评估工具，能够弥补传统评估指标的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)的插件式方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，从而增强LLM预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要由于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。注意力矩阵通常稀疏，特别是长序列，这提供了优化机会。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，利用注意力的置换特性增加块级稀疏性。通过自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核实现，将序列分区为块并跳过部分块的计算。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确率上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线。在长上下文预填充中实现端到端加速高达2.75倍。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种实用的块稀疏注意力方法，能够有效提高LLM长上下文处理的计算效率，同时保持高准确率。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用LLM作为强化学习代理的方法，通过提示而非微调，在非语言任务中实现与传统RL代理相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在强化学习任务中的表现，特别是在需要结构化、非语言推理的环境中，而不仅仅是依赖语言表示的任务。

Method: 通过提示将动作、状态和奖励编码，让LLM通过试错交互学习，无需微调。

Result: 在简单环境中能匹配或超越传统RL代理，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中存在性能限制。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为有效的RL代理，但当前方法在处理复杂数学和状态解码方面仍有局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性引导的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中，准确估计LLM的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，通常需要大量昂贵的生成样本。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术来去偏和优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下覆盖更多语义簇，性能达到或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强工具，无需访问基础LLM的梯度，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了英语中typoglycemia现象（字母内部顺序打乱仍可识别）对NLP模型的影响，发现单词混淆率低且上下文差异大，使得BERT等模型在字母打乱情况下性能下降比预期小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么NLP模型在字母内部顺序打乱（typoglycemia）的情况下仍能保持良好性能，特别是当不同单词（如form和from）在typoglycemia下会变成相同表示时。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况，评估BERT消歧能力，比较在干净文本和typoglycemic文本上训练的BERT变体。

Result: 英语中因typoglycemia导致的单词混淆相对较少，混淆单词的上下文差异明显，BERT在字母打乱情况下性能下降幅度小于预期。

Conclusion: NLP模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性主要源于英语单词混淆率低和上下文信息充足，使得即使字母顺序打乱也能有效理解文本。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重性和旅行者容忍度等维度，评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能生成个性化行程，但无法处理现实旅行中常见的中断情况，需要评估LLM在面临真实世界不确定性时的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1) 引入自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2) LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3) 人工专家评估语义、空间、时序和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: LLM在时序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小。然而，随着行程长度增加，LLM处理中断的能力下降，显示其鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实世界不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，但实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，研究多轮训练对推理任务的必要性。

Result: 单轮训练模型能有效泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练模型在单轮推理性能上出现显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练仅提供有限益处甚至可能损害推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多瑞典基准测试是翻译自美国中心化的基准，不适合测试瑞典特定相关知识。需要专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的基准来评估模型对本土知识的掌握程度。

Method: 手动编写针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准数据集，灵感来自瑞典文化媒体名人的流行广播节目和主要体育赛事。数据集包含英语翻译，可用于测试不同规模和瑞典语覆盖程度的模型。

Result: 瑞典语覆盖更强的小型模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集具有作为诊断工具的潜力，可用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留，特别是在语言适应过程中。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Motivation: 解决形态丰富的语言（如土耳其语）在大规模预训练中代表性不足的问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）从头训练RoBERTa基础的编码器模型，发布基础和大型两种配置。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现优异，大型变体在四个任务中的两个获得最佳分数，但整体没有一致的规模优势。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base

language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Conclusion: HalleluBERT展示了完全收敛的单语预训练的优势，为希伯来语NLP提供了强大的编码器。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual

TL;DR: 提出使用视觉语言模型进行人体活动识别的新方法，通过创建描述性字幕数据集和综合评估方法，证明VLMs在医疗监测中可以达到甚至超越传统深度学习模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中展现出潜力，但在人体活动识别领域应用不足，且缺乏评估其动态、非确定性输出的有效方法。

Method: 引入描述性字幕数据集，提出综合评估方法，并与最先进的深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Result: VLMs实现了与传统方法相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越了传统方法的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VLMs在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标来解决传统IR指标在RAG系统中的不匹配问题，通过考虑LLM处理文档的整体性和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提升了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，但在RAG系统中LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，提出UDCG指标使用LLM导向的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提升了高达36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型，主要原因是去噪过程中掩码token的独立生成未能捕捉token相关性

Method: 使用多奖励优化方法，结合测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来直接优化token相关性，并引入组步和重要性采样策略降低奖励方差

Result: MRO不仅提升了推理性能，还在保持高推理基准性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的关键，MRO方法有效解决了这一问题

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的大脑对齐方法依赖于个体参与者数据，难以泛化到新参与者并进行群体分析，需要开发更通用的方法。

Method: 通过微调预训练语音语言模型，使其能够联合预测多个参与者的fMRI响应，实现跨参与者的大脑对齐。

Result: 方法使预测新参与者大脑数据所需的fMRI数据量减少5倍，整体大脑对齐度提高50%，并能很好地泛化到新的未见数据集。

Conclusion: 多参与者大脑调优不仅提高了大脑对齐效果，还改善了语义任务的下游性能，展示了神经科学与AI之间的双向受益。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机制检测的方法来识别RAG系统中的幻觉，通过计算外部上下文分数和参数知识分数，训练回归分类器来预测幻觉，并在多个LLM上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然通过整合外部知识来减少幻觉，但模型仍经常生成与检索内容不一致的输出。现有方法通常混淆了外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，需要准确分离这两者来进行有效的幻觉检测。

Method: 研究RAG幻觉机制，发现当后层FFN模块不成比例地将参数知识注入残差流时会产生幻觉。基于外部上下文分数和参数知识分数，在Qwen3-0.6b上计算各层和各注意力头的分数，训练回归分类器来预测幻觉。

Result: 方法在多个先进LLM（GPT-5、GPT-4.1）和检测基线（RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker）上进行了评估。在Qwen3-0.6b上训练的模型能够泛化到GPT-4.1-mini的响应，证明了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效、可泛化的预测因子，为幻觉检测提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Conclusion: 范畴论为文档结构分析提供了有力的数学工具，问答对表示和正交化方法有效支持信息度量和内容操作，RLVR自监督方法能显著提升大预训练模型的性能。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言行为中的变异是否受到语言谱系结构的影响，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 扩展MultiQ数据集的分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度不保持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并研究谱系内部与跨谱系的知识一致性差异。

Result: 发现存在谱系级别效应，但受训练资源可用性的强烈制约，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs确实编码了谱系级别结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，需要超越表面语言能力的更具挑战性评估。语言能力不仅包括语法和语义，还包括语用学，即理解受语境、语言和文化规范影响的情境意义。

Method: 构建了斯洛文尼亚语的语用理解基准，包含405个选择题，讨论了翻译困难，建立了人类基线，并进行了LLM的试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义时仍可能失败，特别是文化特定的表达。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类反应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借词，这会误导语言分析，需要系统方法来提高数据质量。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征的无监督异常检测算法，识别潜在的转录错误和借词。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线，尽管由于异常性质微妙，精确度和召回率仍然有限，但高召回率方法为田野工作者提供了系统标记需要验证条目的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法支持低资源语言文档中的数据质量改进，为田野工作者提供了系统验证工具。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但在金融领域的股票预测任务中应用不足。现有模型存在两个问题：(1) 过度依赖分析师观点而非独立分析逻辑；(2) 未能有效权衡对抗性证据，限制了预测的可靠性。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动训练。该方法鼓励模型从多样化信息源动态构建分析框架，基于框架组织和评分支持股价上涨或下跌的证据，而非依赖上下文观点，最终通过反思得出预测。

Result: 构建了大规模数据集（2024年全年5123只A股，32K tokens长上下文，20万+样本），实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力，即使在6个月后或分布外股票上，推理时缩放仍然有效。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过增强模型的独立逻辑推理能力，减少了上下文的不当影响，使模型获得了有价值的股票预测洞察，显著提升了金融预测任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Motivation: 在经济设计中，许多问题涉及类型依赖的参与约束和双边弱优超约束，需要处理凸函数约束集。CFIs为这类问题提供了统一的数学框架。

Method: 提出凸函数区间(CFIs)概念，建立其极值点的几何特征，推导线性规划的最优性条件，开发嵌套优化方法用于处理下边界优化问题。

Result: 获得了CFIs的几何特征和最优性条件，成功应用于四个经济设计问题：筛选与委托、有限处置的竞赛设计、带信息约束的均值说服。

Conclusion: CFIs为经济设计问题提供了有力的分析工具，揭示了新的经济洞见，如更好的外部选择导致更大的委托集，在类型依赖参与约束下固定价格机制可能不是最优的。

Abstract: We introduce convex function intervals (CFIs): families of convex functions
satisfying given level and slope constraints. CFIs naturally arise as
constraint sets in economic design, including problems with type-dependent
participation constraints and two-sided (weak) majorization constraints. Our
main results include: (i) a geometric characterization of the extreme points of
CFIs; (ii) sufficient optimality conditions for linear programs over CFIs; and
(iii) methods for nested optimization on their lower level boundary that can be
applied, e.g., to the optimal design of outside options. We apply these results
to four settings: screening and delegation problems with type-dependent outside
options, contest design with limited disposal, and mean-based persuasion with
informativeness constraints. We draw several novel economic implications using
our tools. For instance, we show that better outside options lead to larger
delegation sets, and that posted price mechanisms can be suboptimal in the
canonical monopolistic screening problem with nontrivial, type-dependent
participation constraints.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 研究委托代理采购问题中，当委托人不知道代理人的某些边际成本类型时，代理人可能通过沟通来提升委托人的认知。分析发现，当委托人不知道高成本类型时，这些类型有动机提升认知；当类型超过三个时，某些原本已知的类型可能不再有动机提升认知；当委托人不知道低成本类型时，没有类型会主动提升认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在信息不对称的委托代理关系中，当委托人存在认知局限（不知道某些成本类型）时，代理人如何通过沟通来影响委托人的认知，以及这种认知提升对合同设计和信息租金的影响。

Method: 采用离散凹模型，通过理性化程序分析，其中对类型的边际信念受限于对数凹性、"反向"贝叶斯主义和谨慎假设。

Result: 当委托人不知道高成本类型时，这些类型会主动提升认知；在三种类型情况下，已知的两种低成本类型也愿意提升对高成本类型的认知；但当类型超过三个时，某些已知类型可能不再有动机提升认知；当委托人不知道低成本类型时，没有类型会主动提升认知。

Conclusion: 代理人的认知提升动机取决于委托人初始认知状态和类型结构，认知提升会影响合同菜单设计和信息租金分配，但并非所有情况下认知提升都对代理人有利。

Abstract: We analyze a principal-agent procurement problem in which the principal (she)
is unaware some of the marginal cost types of the agent (he). Communication
arises naturally as some types of the agent may have an incentive to raise the
principal's awareness (totally or partially) before a contract menu is offered.
The resulting menu must not only reflect the principal's change in awareness,
but also her learning about types from the agent's decision to raise her
awareness in the first place. We capture this reasoning in a discrete concave
model via a rationalizability procedure in which marginal beliefs over types
are restricted to log-concavity, ``reverse'' Bayesianism, and mild assumptions
of caution.
  We show that if the principal is ex ante only unaware of high-cost types, all
of these types have an incentive raise her awareness of them -- otherwise, they
would not be served. With three types, the two lower-cost types that the
principal is initially aware of also want to raise her awareness of the
high-cost type: Their quantities suffer no additional distortions and they both
earn an extra information rent. Intuitively, the presence of an even higher
cost type makes the original two look better. With more than three types, we
show that this intuition may break down for types of whom the principal is
initially aware of so that raising the principal's awareness could cease to be
profitable for those types. When the principal is ex ante only unaware of more
efficient (low-cost) types, then \textit{no type} raises her awareness, leaving
her none the wiser.

TL;DR: 该论文研究离散类型代理的筛选问题，使用离散一阶方法分析离散数量和转移支付的最优合约设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是研究在离散类型和离散合约条件下，如何复制连续合约筛选的典型约束简化结果，并探索离散筛选方法的应用。

Method: 采用离散一阶方法，假设委托人估值是离散严格凹函数，代理成本类型为非整数，将整数类型作为极限情况处理。引入Δ-O理性化概念来求解筛选问题。

Result: 结果显示离散一阶条件的解可能不唯一，但每个类型最多有两个最优合约数量且必须相邻。数量只能保证弱单调性，除非限制委托人效用的凹度。Δ-O理性化菜单与通常最优合约集一致。

Conclusion: 结论是离散筛选方法便于使用理性化求解筛选问题，Δ-O理性化概念具有对类型信念的鲁棒性，能够识别最优合约集。

Abstract: We consider a principal who wishes to screen an agent with \emph{discrete}
types by offering a menu of \emph{discrete} quantities and \emph{discrete}
transfers. We assume that the principal's valuation is discrete strictly
concave and use a discrete first-order approach. We model the agent's cost
types as non-integer, with integer types as a limit case. Our modeling of cost
types allows us to replicate the typical constraint-simplification results and
thus to emulate the well-treaded steps of screening under a continuum of
contracts.
  We show that the solutions to the discrete F.O.C.s need not be unique
\textit{even under discrete strict concavity}, but we also show that there
cannot be more than two optimal contract quantities for each type, and that --
if there are two -- they must be adjacent. Moreover, we can only ensure weak
monotonicity of the quantities \textit{even if virtual costs are strictly
monotone}, unless we limit the ``degree of concavity'' of the principal's
utility. Our discrete screening approach facilitates the use of
rationalizability to solve the screening problem. We introduce a
rationalizability notion featuring robustness with respect to an open set of
beliefs over types called \textit{$\Delta$-O Rationalizability}, and show that
the set of $\Delta$-O rationalizable menus coincides with the set of usual
optimal contracts -- possibly augmented to include irrelevant contracts.

Motivation: 研究在私有信息代理和信息受限调解者环境中，调解者通过提供公共信号能够诱导的后验信念集合，旨在理解信息结构的设计限制。

Method: 采用图论框架：状态表示为顶点，信息集对应边，边上的似然比函数编码后验信念。推导了后验合理化的内部和外部一致性条件。

Result: 建立了后验信念可诱导性的充要条件，并识别了单一调解者能够实现多个后验信念的条件，使其成为Blackwell实验生成器。

Conclusion: 图论框架为分析信息受限调解者诱导后验信念的能力提供了有效工具，确定了单一调解者作为Blackwell实验生成器的可行性条件。

Abstract: We examine information structures in settings with privately informed agents
and an informationally constrained mediator who supplies additional public
signals. Our focus is on characterizing the set of posteriors that the mediator
can induce. To this end, we employ a graph-theoretic framework: states are
represented as vertices, information sets correspond to edges, and a likelihood
ratio function on edges encodes the posterior beliefs. Within this framework,
we derive necessary and sufficient conditions, internal and external
consistency, for the rationalization of posteriors. Finally, we identify
conditions under which a single mediator can implement multiple posteriors,
effectively serving as a generator of Blackwell experiments.

*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种人机交互流程，将未缩放的徒手绘制的平面图草图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型，利用多模态大语言模型在多智能体框架中实现感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使BIM创建对专家和非专家都更加便捷，仅使用徒手草图即可生成3D BIM模型，降低技术门槛。

Method: 采用多智能体框架的多模态大语言模型，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D BIM模型。

Result: 在十个不同平面图上的实验显示，开口（门、窗）在初始阶段即可高可靠性地捕捉，墙体检测从约83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美的对齐。所有类别的精确度、召回率和F1分数均保持在0.83以上，几何误差（RMSE、MAE）通过反馈修正逐渐降至零。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于MLLM的多智能体推理能够使仅使用徒手草图的BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可行，展示了该方法的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在艺术等开放领域生成创意时，要么陷入熟悉的文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念组合的合理性，文化背景模型评估组合在艺术家作品中的典型性。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的概念组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术专业学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化能够释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持连贯性的同时生成新颖创意。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、运算结果可能改变模糊集特征（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不是三角模糊数）、以及模糊扩散问题，这些问题限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数，定义了外延模糊数的运算方法（如加法、乘法等）和关系运算符（=、>、>=、<、<=），并通过应用实例进行说明。

Result: 提出的外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算的问题，降低了计算复杂度，保持了运算结果的模糊集特征，并减少了模糊扩散问题。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和实用的方法，扩展了模糊数的应用领域，并提供了可用的C++实现。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录系统中药物数据格式不统一的问题，特别是阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方的标准化监控需求。

Method: 定制开源LLMs（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）从异构数据中提取处方属性，通过JSON模式处理记录，并进行轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，实现了真实环境中MOUD暴露、依从性和保留率的一致跨站点分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨何时应该优先采纳AI输出而非人类专家判断，提出AI预占主义观点并分析其问题，最终发展出基于全面证据的AI遵从理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在可靠性方面表现出色，一些系统可被视为人工认知权威。需要探讨在什么情况下应该优先采纳AI输出而非人类专家判断，以及如何避免认知权威带来的问题。

Method: 通过社会认识论分析，提出AI预占主义观点，然后批判其问题（如不加批判的遵从、认知固化等），最后发展出基于全面证据的AI遵从理论。

Result: 发现AI预占主义存在放大版本的问题，而基于全面证据的方法具有三个关键优势：减轻专业知识萎缩、为人类监督提供认知依据、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 基于全面证据的AI遵从理论提供了一种原则性方法来确定何时AI遵从是合理的，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中，AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知考量。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL和PostGIS等地理空间函数的复杂性阻碍了非专家进行空间数据分析，现有单智能体方法难以处理空间查询的语义和语法复杂性

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括知识库、程序化模式分析、语义增强、上下文检索嵌入，以及协作代理管道（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成）和验证代理

Result: 在KaggleDBQA上达到81.2%准确率，空间查询达到87.7%准确率（相比无验证代理的76.7%），且生成查询更符合用户意图

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易用，为空间文本到SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗临床服务部署中面临三个关键挑战：产生与视觉证据无关的幻觉答案、固定深度推理效率低下、多机构协作困难。

Method: 1. 多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，将偏好学习与视觉上下文对齐；2. 检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，通过图像和文本相似度路由查询到专门的上下文增强LVLM专家；3. 联邦治理机制，基于mDPO在临床数据集上微调的专家通过本地元认知不确定性估计器执行迭代链式思维推理。

Conclusion: MedAlign通过结合mDPO、RA-MoE和联邦治理机制，有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，实现了高精度和高效的医学视觉问答。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous

major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性的恐惧和痛苦发作，及时适当的干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但由于伦理和后勤问题，训练这类模型的合适数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集（包含基于第一人称叙事构建的高痛苦发作事件，围绕心理急救原则构建），训练PACER咨询模型（提供共情和指导性支持，通过监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化），提出PanicEval多维评估框架。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,

However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a

narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，在RAG系统中实现高效的模型记忆覆盖攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法忽视了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文中毒知识强相关的毒害响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过归因信号重用有潜力的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实验，持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了知识冲突问题，能够大规模生成有效的RAG中毒知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了EGO-Prompt框架，通过进化图优化自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为LLMs设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率等问题

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的初始语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化：生成确定性推理指导，并适应LLM有效利用该指导

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt比前沿方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，小模型能以不到20%成本达到大模型性能

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt能自动优化提示和推理过程，显著提升LLM在领域任务中的性能，同时输出精炼的领域特定语义因果图提高可解释性

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性选择答案，显著改善了概率指令跟随(PIF)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务上表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: SSoT提示方法：先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的偏见问题，提高输出多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级、无内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和零空间约束来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法在适应新知识的同时避免遗忘原有能力。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架不仅有效保护零样本迁移能力，还在持续学习基准上取得了极具竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Shylock方法，用于多变量时间序列的因果发现，特别适用于小样本场景，通过组扩张卷积和共享核减少参数，结合全局和局部约束提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图准则方法，容易出错、依赖理想假设和大量数据。多变量时间序列存在数据稀缺问题，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带时间延迟的变量表示。结合全局约束和局部约束实现网络间信息共享。设计了数据生成方法来生成带时间延迟的多变量时间序列。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在小样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法在多变量时间序列因果发现中表现优异，特别是在数据稀缺的小样本场景下。开发了Tcausal库并部署在EarthDataMiner平台上便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，证明其安全性变得至关重要。OOD检测能够处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况，对安全关键领域的自主系统安全保证具有重要意义。

Method: 采用系统性综述方法，首先定义相关概念，分析OOD产生原因，识别使自主系统安全保证和OOD检测具有挑战性的因素，然后综述在整个ML开发生命周期中可用的OOD检测技术。

Result: 识别了一系列可在ML开发生命周期中使用的OOD检测技术，并提出了这些技术在生命周期中支持安全保证论证的适用领域，同时指出了系统安全工程师在集成OOD检测时需要注意的注意事项。

Conclusion: OOD检测对于自主系统的安全开发和运行至关重要，但仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究来支持跨领域和应用的自主系统安全运行。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不鲁棒，在具有密集奖励的游戏中出现问题，需要开发对奖励尺度不敏感的λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中已有的λ策略以及五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的λ=2σ方法。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ方法在各种任务中均优于现有λ策略，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往抑制推理能力且无法解决安全与推理的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail(CoG)训练框架，分析模型推理轨迹，发现自我越狱现象，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全与推理权衡问题，通过系统性干预推理过程实现安全性的显著提升而不损害推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致任务成功率较低。

Method: 结合显式符号验证和交互验证过程，在验证阶段生成探索性代码与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态场景中，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该神经符号框架通过增强代码生成的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可信度和诊断性能。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的高概率概念，而现有的搜索方法如ToT依赖于不可靠的自评估启发式方法，缺乏原则性指导。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)和分层引导系统：语义罗盘向量提供长程方向指导，景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自评估，平衡内在连贯性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Magellan显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线，在生成科学想法方面表现出更高的可信度和创新性。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，有原则的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLMs成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [68] [Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency of Budget Forcing in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21398)
*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习(RL)的框架，在1.5B模型上提升数学推理性能，相比仅使用监督微调(SFT)的方法，在GSM8K数据集上准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制等测试时缩放方法虽然计算效率高，但依赖长上下文推理轨迹的SFT会导致小模型性能下降，因为产生冗长响应。需要提高token效率并提升小模型的数学推理性能。

Method: 集成强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，结合SFT+RL训练1.5B模型，在不同计算预算下进行数学推理。

Result: SFT+RL模型在GSM8K数据集上表现更好，总体准确率更高，同时token使用量相比SFT模型显著减少超过40%。

Conclusion: RL可以恢复因长上下文训练造成的损失，整体提升数学推理性能，证明RL在提高token效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

*Maneeha Rani,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的分类框架，将符号AI集成到大型语言模型(LLMs)中，以解决LLMs缺乏透明度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在学习和决策方面表现出色，但缺乏透明度。现有的神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络设计，不适用于LLMs的独特特性，因此需要系统性地理解如何将符号AI有效集成到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLMs中符号集成的新分类法，并制定将符号技术与LLMs融合的路线图。该路线图引入了四个维度的分类框架：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式以及算法和应用层面视角。

Result: 论文全面识别了当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距，提出了未来研究的路线图。通过组织现有文献到这些类别中，提供了实用的框架实施见解。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著差距，为将符号集成框架实施到LLMs中以增强透明度提供了实用见解。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，以及AutoOpt框架——一个基于机器学习的自动化优化问题求解系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题需要专家手动建模和求解的繁琐过程，开发一个能够直接从图像识别并自动求解优化问题的系统。

Method: 开发了包含三个模块的AutoOpt框架：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER模型在BLEU分数上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架能够有效自动化优化问题的求解过程，在数学表达式识别和复杂问题求解方面表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和潜在空间扩展，让统一求解器能够感知VRP变体的共享组件特性，重用基础求解器，避免神经网络求解器数量指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务VRP神经方法通常学习统一求解器同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，错失了专门化基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 引入状态可分解MDP将状态空间表示为基础VRP变体状态空间的笛卡尔积，开发潜在空间扩展结合最优基础策略和可学习混合函数，实现MoSES求解器使用专门化LoRA专家和自适应门控机制。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过重用基础求解器有效解决了统一求解器对VRP变体组合结构利用不足的问题，在多个VRP变体上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在欧盟法律框架下合规性的基准测试，通过验证性人工策划的场景测试代理是否会在看似良性的用户请求下采取非法行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种场景中的部署增加，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不理想和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行动的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人工策划基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别场景。通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较，评估前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究在系统提示中提供相关立法摘录对合规性的影响。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究了提供立法摘录对合规性的影响。发布了公开预览集供研究社区使用，同时保留私有测试集以防止数据污染。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同的法律管辖区，以及多轮和多语言交互。发布了代码供研究使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中的验证不足问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长程推理失败往往不是生成能力不足，而是中间推理验证不够充分，需要建立可证伪和可审计的推理过程。

Method: 使用冲突感知元验证(CAMV)将验证重新定义为冲突识别和针对性证伪，以及可信推理结构化事实(TRSF)持续组织、验证和同步证据，形成闭环验证循环。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体的可靠长程推理提供了可扩展的范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了性能提升。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，而是通过专家演示来学习安全约束函数，然后在模拟轨迹上训练神经CBF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统方法需要明确指定失败状态集，但在许多实际场景中（如自动驾驶中的尾随行为），失败状态集难以形式化指定，而生成专家演示则相对容易。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，表明该方法优于现有基线方法，并且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的神经CBF训练方法，无需明确指定失败状态集，仅需专家演示即可实现有效的安全控制。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)方法来解决自改进编码代理中的元生产力-性能不匹配问题，通过引入CMP指标来指导自修改树的搜索，在多个编码基准测试中取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自改进编码代理主要依赖软件工程基准性能来选择自修改，但作者发现代理的自改进潜力（元生产力）与其编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自改进潜力，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)方法，通过估计CMP来指导自修改树的搜索过程。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于现有方法且使用更少时间。优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能。

Conclusion: HGM方法有效解决了自改进编码代理中的元生产力-性能不匹配问题，展示了在多个编码数据集和大型语言模型上的强迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Motivation: 现有代理框架通常遵循预定义工作流程，限制了自主性和全局任务完成能力。现实世界任务需要外部工具和长时交互，现有方法难以有效处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出了自主记忆折叠机制压缩过往交互为结构化记忆，以及ToolPO强化学习策略，利用LLM模拟API并通过工具调用优势归因来精细分配信用。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，包括通用工具使用任务和下游应用，DeepAgent在标记工具和开放集工具检索场景中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作向构建更通用和强大的现实世界应用代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在多方面不足：无法全面衡量真实科学研究的用例、缺乏可复现的代理工具、未考虑模型成本和工具访问等混杂变量、缺少标准化接口、缺乏全面的基线代理。

Method: 定义了严格的基准原则和工具，开发了AstaBench套件，包含覆盖整个科学发现过程的2400+问题，提供生产级搜索工具的科学研究环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的基准来评估AI科学代理，AstaBench提供了这样的框架，但当前AI在科学研辅助方面仍有很大差距。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要复杂多本体匹配来建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次结构上的溯源。

Method: 使用检索增强生成选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例，增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，专门分析能源公司公关视频中的框架类型，特别是绿色创新等环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公司公关活动存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"现象），需要大规模理解框架变化来揭示公关活动的真实目的和性质。

Method: 构建专家标注的视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型，覆盖50多家公司和20个国家，专门用于视觉语言模型评估。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1检测环境信息的F1分数为79%，而最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐含框架、不同长度视频和隐性文化背景方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱的框架，作为智能翻译层来解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间的语义鸿沟问题，使复杂协调路径能够通过简单修改知识图谱中的事实来调整。

Method: 采用知识图谱作为核心框架，其双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾自主水下航行器的案例研究，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略会产生不同的高性能结果。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

### [81] [Edgeworth's exact and naturally weighted evolutionary utilitarianism and the happiness of Mr. Pongo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20854)
*Alberto Baccini*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文重新解读了埃奇沃思的学术计划，揭示他通过数学统一道德科学，将功利主义重构为精确科学，并基于心理物理学和进化生物学得出反平等主义结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战对埃奇沃思的传统解读，重构他通过数学统一道德科学的学术计划，揭示其功利主义体系如何利用科学中立性来自然化和合理化现存社会等级。

Method: 将个体建模为"准费希纳"函数，根据个体在进化秩序中的位置确定其快乐能力，通过按快乐能力分配资源来解决功利最大化问题。

Result: 得出了激进的反对平等主义结论，认为为了在自然不平等个体间最大化福利，必须按快乐能力分配资源，并将这一逻辑应用于不同进化秩序、种族、性别和阶级。

Conclusion: 后续经济学家（从熊彼特开始）对其功利主义的外科手术式去除虽然使其工具更易接受，但却阉割了他的整体哲学体系，掩盖了其科学中立性外表下的社会等级合理化本质。

Abstract: This article challenges the conventional reading of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth
by reconstructing his intellectual project of unifying the moral sciences
through mathematics. The contribution he made in the first phase of his
writing, culminating in \textit{Mathematical Psychics}, aimed to reconfigure
utilitarianism as an exact science, grounding it in psychophysics and
evolutionary biology. In order to solve the utilitarian problem of maximizing
pleasure for a given set of sentient beings, he modeled individuals as
``quasi-Fechnerian'' functions, which incorporated their capacity for pleasure
as determined by their place in the evolutionary order. The problem of
maximization is solved by distributing means according to the individuals'
capacity for pleasure. His radical anti-egalitarian conclusions did not stem
from an abstract principle of justice, but from the necessity to maximize
welfare among naturally unequal beings. This logic was applied not only to
sentients of different evolutionary orders, such as Mr. Pongo, a famous
gorilla, and humans, but also to human races, sexes, and classes. The system,
in essence, uses the apparent neutrality of science to naturalize and justify
pre-existing social hierarchies. This analysis reveals that the subsequent
surgical removal of his utilitarianism by economists, starting with Schumpeter,
while making his tools palatable, eviscerates his overarching philosophical
system.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了1990-2022年智利产业政策的演变，发现尽管智利增加了科技投资，但仍难以转化为可持续创新能力，存在协调不足、区域不平等和知识文化脆弱等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全球政府重新强调创新角色的背景下，智利作为稳定开放经济体却面临创新投资难以转化为可持续能力的悖论，需要研究其产业政策演变。

Method: 采用纵向案例研究方法，结合官方数据，整合演化经济学、公共政策和人文主义伦理学的理论框架。

Result: 研究发现智利改进了创新机构，但仍存在协调薄弱、区域不平等和知识文化脆弱等问题。

Conclusion: 实现包容性创新需要适应性治理和将创新视为公共产品的伦理愿景。

Abstract: The study explores the evolution of Chile's industrial policy from 1990 to
2022 through the lens of state capacity, innovation and endogenous development.
In a global context where governments are reasserting their role as active
agents of innovation, Chile presents a paradox. It is a stable and open economy
that has expanded investment in science and technology but still struggles to
transform this effort into sustainable capabilities. Drawing on the works of
Mazzucato, Aghion, Howitt, Mokyr, Samuelson and Sampedro, the study integrates
evolutionary economics, public policy and humanist ethics. Using a longitudinal
case study approach and official data, it finds that Chile has improved its
innovation institutions but continues to experience weak coordination, regional
inequality and a fragile culture of knowledge. The research concludes that
achieving inclusive innovation requires adaptive governance and an ethical
vision of innovation as a public good.

TL;DR: 分析央行数字货币(CBDC)对金融稳定和福利的影响，发现CBDC可能加剧银行挤兑和金融不稳定，但对宏观经济影响有限，主要通过利率和信贷渠道影响财富分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CBDC引入对金融稳定性和福利的影响，特别是在银行风险感知导致存款转移的情况下。

Method: 使用宏观经济代理模型，考虑企业、银行和家庭在劳动力、商品、信贷和银行间市场的互动，模拟家庭基于银行风险感知将流动性从存款转移到CBDC的行为。

Result: CBDC加剧银行挤兑和金融不稳定；对宏观经济变量影响小但贷款利率上升、信贷下降；财富从企业和银行重新分配到家庭，银行违约率上升；可能产生负面福利效应。

Conclusion: CBDC引入可能带来金融不稳定风险，但通过设置持有限额可以改善福利效应。

Abstract: We analyse financial stability and welfare impacts associated with the
introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in a macroeconomic
agent-based model. The model considers firms, banks, and households interacting
on labour, goods, credit, and interbank markets. Households move their
liquidity from deposits to CBDC based on the perceived riskiness of their
banks. We find that the introduction of CBDC exacerbates bank-runs and may lead
to financial instability phenomena. The effect can be changed by introducing a
limit on CBDC holdings. The adoption of CBDC has little effect on macroeconomic
variables but the interest rate on loans to firms goes up and credit goes down
in a limited way. CBDC leads to a redistribution of wealth from firms and banks
to households with a higher bank default rate. CBDC may have negative welfare
effects, but a bound on holding enables a welfare improvement.

TL;DR: SLIM是一个用于非线性GMM的可扩展随机近似框架，通过小批量矩条件及其导数形成迭代更新，实现几乎必然收敛，无需一致初始估计量或全局凸性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GMM方法在大规模非线性模型中的计算效率问题，特别是当矩条件数量庞大时，传统方法收敛缓慢甚至无法收敛。

Method: 使用独立小批量的矩条件及其导数形成随机近似更新，开发二阶精化和基于随机缩放、插件方法的推断程序，包括专门为随机学习设计的Sargan-Hansen J检验的插件、去偏插件和在线版本。

Result: 在基于非线性EASI需求系统的蒙特卡洛实验中，SLIM在1.4小时内解决了具有576个矩条件、380个参数和n=10^5的模型，而全样本GMM需要18小时。去偏插件J检验提供了令人满意的有限样本推断，SLIM可平滑扩展到n=10^6。

Conclusion: SLIM为大规模非线性GMM估计提供了一个高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了良好的统计性质。

Abstract: We propose SLIM (Stochastic Learning and Inference in overidentified Models),
a scalable stochastic approximation framework for nonlinear GMM. SLIM forms
iterative updates from independent mini-batches of moments and their
derivatives, producing unbiased directions that ensure almost-sure convergence.
It requires neither a consistent initial estimator nor global convexity and
accommodates both fixed-sample and random-sampling asymptotics. We further
develop an optional second-order refinement and inference procedures based on
random scaling and plug-in methods, including plug-in, debiased plug-in, and
online versions of the Sargan--Hansen $J$-test tailored to stochastic learning.
In Monte Carlo experiments based on a nonlinear EASI demand system with 576
moment conditions, 380 parameters, and $n = 10^5$, SLIM solves the model in
under 1.4 hours, whereas full-sample GMM in Stata on a powerful laptop
converges only after 18 hours. The debiased plug-in $J$-test delivers
satisfactory finite-sample inference, and SLIM scales smoothly to $n = 10^6$.

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，将推理从性能负担转变为性能增益，在MMAU Test-mini上达到SOTA，接近人类水平的MMSU推理表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理作用未被充分探索，推理过程在推理时往往导致性能下降而非提升，这种现象被称为测试时逆缩放，即更长的推理链产生更差的结果。

Method: 引入CESAR框架，从结果验证转向奖励推理过程。采用在线强化学习，使用具有多方面奖励套件的组相对策略优化，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上达到最先进结果，显著优于Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平表现。增强的推理还产生了协同效应，同时改善了多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发音频LLM中稳健且可扩展的推理建立了原则性方法，将推理从损害转变为增益，并揭示了模型特定的"推理甜点"。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法依赖预定义图拓扑，无法适应不同危机机制下的市场动态变化，需要能够自适应发现危机相关依赖关系的框架。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力处理时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，过滤92.5%的连接作为噪声。

Result: 在2005-2021年数据训练后，CRISP在2022-2024年通胀驱动市场（完全不同机制）中表现稳健，夏普比率达3.76，比等权重基准提高707%，比静态图方法提高94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过自适应图注意力机制实现了危机期间的稳健预测，学习到的注意力权重提供了可解释的机制检测，防御性集群注意力在危机期间增强49%。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD算法能够有效生成多样化的帕累托最优解集，在超体积性能和解决方案多样性方面表现优异

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐，这会抑制弱模态的独特信息。需要一种新方法来平衡模态间关系，同时保留各模态的特定信息。

Method: 提出多模态负向学习框架，主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，而不是增强目标类别预测。通过增加单模态置信度边界来提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在噪声和不平衡场景下有效降低了弱模态的实证误差，优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: 负向学习范式能够稳定决策空间，保留模态特定信息，在多模态学习中具有有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: 重尾SGD结合梯度裁剪能够找到几何形状更平坦的局部最小值，并实现更好的泛化性能，这为理解SGD的全局行为提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

*Sungjun Cho,Changho Shin,Suenggwan Jo,Xinya Yan,Shourjo Aditya Chaudhuri,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LLM集成贝叶斯状态空间模型(LBS)，这是一个用于多模态时间预测的概率框架，结合了状态空间模型和大型语言模型来处理结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的预测需要整合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息，但现有方法在架构上受到固定输入/输出视野的限制，并且无法建模或量化不确定性。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)骨干网络，捕捉潜在状态的时间动态；(2)预训练的大型语言模型(LLM)，用于编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前的最先进性能提高了13.20%，同时为每个预测提供人类可读的摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时间推理提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可逆性的安全强化学习方法，通过模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无模型强化学习缺乏形式化安全保证，现有方法通常依赖详细的安全规范知识。许多难以明确规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征。

Method: 利用可逆性防止训练过程中的安全问题，使用模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，只需查询黑盒动态系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提算法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效保证强化学习训练过程中的安全性，且不需要显式的动态模型或安全约束知识。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年人跌倒是一个严重的健康问题，传统跌倒检测方法存在泛化性差、隐私担忧和个体行为差异等挑战。

Method: 使用集成惩罚联邦学习框架，结合同态加密和联邦训练保护隐私，采用惩罚性本地训练和基于集成的推理来提高模型一致性和适应性。

Conclusion: EPFL提供了一个可扩展、安全且准确的跌倒检测解决方案，具有通过自适应反馈机制持续改进的潜力。

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论者为了获胜而误导裁判，引入更多错误，表现甚至不如单智能体方法。需要解决这种辩论黑客问题。

Method: 提出ColMAD协议，将多智能体辩论重新定义为非零和博弈，鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，互相补充遗漏点，为裁判提供更全面的证据。

Result: 实验表明，ColMAD比之前的竞争性多智能体辩论方法提升了19%的性能，并在错误检测任务上相比单智能体方法带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD通过将辩论重新定义为非零和博弈，有效缓解了辩论黑客问题，显著提升了大型语言模型的错误检测能力。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于向量copula理论的互信息估计器，在复杂模型和简化模型之间取得平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计器要么依赖需要大量数据的复杂模型（如神经网络），要么使用过于简化的模型（如高斯copula）而无法捕捉复杂分布

Method: 基于近期向量copula理论，在两种极端方法之间进行原则性插值，实现复杂性和容量的更好权衡

Result: 在先进合成基准测试和具有多样模态的真实世界数据上的实验证明了所提估计器的优势

Conclusion: 该方法在互信息估计中实现了复杂性和容量之间的更好平衡

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文评估了隐式神经表示（INRs）在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖学表示中的性能，发现INRs在无需大量超参数调优的情况下，能够实现高达约230的压缩比，并在解剖学表示中保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示（INRs）作为一种强大的知识表示框架，具有分辨率独立性和高内存效率，但其在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未得到充分理解。本研究旨在评估INRs在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖学表示中的性能。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练的位置编码以及非线性核的线性组合。在胸主动脉中评估了INRs对空间和时间变化血流动力学场的压缩性能。

Result: 在胸主动脉的血流动力学场中，INRs实现了高达约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差为1 mmHg，速度最大绝对误差为5-10 cm/s。在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5 mm和1.6 mm。SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式神经表示在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖学表示中表现出色，能够实现高压缩比和高精度，为医学图像和模拟数据的表示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于金属有机框架（MOF）的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在材料特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现方面突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOF材料设计尤其具有挑战性，因为其三维原子排列复杂且受配位几何和拓扑规则约束，传统文本表示难以捕捉这些信息。

Method: L2M3OF整合了晶体表示学习与语言理解，能够联合处理结构、文本和知识模态。它使用预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层将结构信息压缩到令牌空间，实现与语言指令的高效对齐。

Result: 实验表明，L2M3OF在材料特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源LLM，尽管使用的参数数量少得多。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了多模态方法在理解多孔材料中的重要性，并将L2M3OF确立为材料发现领域下一代AI系统的基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，这限制了预训练模型在下游任务上的适配能力。需要开发能够在严格内存预算下有效进行微调的方法。

Method: 提出LaRa层重要性度量方法进行层预选，以及动态通道采样策略，利用通道重要性分布在微调过程中的时间稳定性，在epoch间根据重要性加权概率动态重采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下实现了最先进的性能，持续优于现有的静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率，能够在低至几百kB RAM的内存预算下有效微调。

Conclusion: MeDyate代表了实现高效设备端学习的重要进展，通过动态子网络适配在严格内存限制下实现了有效的模型微调。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Motivation: 标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著的性能下降，而现有方法在资源受限环境下部署大型模型时难以平衡计算需求和模型精度。

Method: 采用分组格向量量化，为每组权重学习生成矩阵来定义格码本，使用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题，训练后解码简化为矩阵向量乘法。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，相比现有后训练量化基线方法，该方法在模型大小和精度之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架在严格资源约束下部署大型模型具有高效性和实用性，为LLM量化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal

settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Motivation: 开发一个能够进行步进预测并在低误报率下实现高精度的SNN训练框架，特别关注资源受限环境下的高效部署。

Conclusion: 该框架能够训练出高效、低功耗的SNN，在多个时间序列分类任务中表现出色，特别适合资源受限的边缘计算应用。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

TL;DR: DD2提出了一种新的条件分数蒸馏方法，用于实现图像自回归模型的一步采样，相比DD1在性能和训练速度上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型虽然性能优秀，但采样步骤多导致生成速度慢。DD1虽然实现了少步采样，但在一步采样时性能下降明显，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器。训练一个单独的网络来预测生成分布的条件分数，并在每个token位置基于前文token进行分数蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2实现了一步采样，FID从3.40仅增加到5.43。相比DD1，将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距缩小了67%，同时训练速度提升高达12.3倍。

Conclusion: DD2为实现一步自回归生成迈出了重要一步，为快速高质量的自回归建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，发现其能产生更平坦的损失景观从而减少遗忘，但会牺牲可塑性。作者提出ZO-FC方法，将零阶优化应用于适配器模块，同时用一阶优化更新分类器，有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中稳定性-可塑性-效率三难问题的新方法，利用其内存效率优势，同时研究其在持续学习中的潜力。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究评估零阶优化在持续学习中的表现，提出ZO-FC方法：对适配器模块使用零阶优化，对分类器使用一阶优化。

Result: 零阶优化能增强稳定性但会削弱可塑性，特别是在可学习分类器的情况下。ZO-FC方法在保持稳定性的同时保留了适应性，实现了有效的平衡。

Conclusion: ZO-FC提供了实用且内存高效的持续学习解决方案，特别适用于设备端场景，有效解决了稳定性与可塑性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 学习率选择对统计和计算效率至关重要，分层训练算法可在不重用样本或修改损失函数的情况下超越相关查询限制。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Conclusion: A-GPS提供了一个简单而强大的方法，能够灵活捕捉用户偏好，避免显式超体积计算，实现高效的帕累托集生成。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Motivation: 联邦学习中梯度共享存在隐私泄露风险，而全同态加密虽然能保护隐私但计算和通信开销巨大。现有方法要么完全加密导致高成本，要么部分加密存在安全漏洞。

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于HE的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，其运行时间仅比明文FL慢2倍以内。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming

*Xiangyang Xu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局-局部上下文图的少样本分子属性预测方法，通过引入化学有意义的基序节点来丰富上下文信息，在全局层面构建三部分异构图，在局部层面为每个节点构建子图进行编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，但在药物发现和材料科学中往往缺乏这样的数据集。现有的少样本分子属性预测方法通过上下文图引入关系归纳偏置，但分子-属性图提供的结构指导有限。

Method: 构建全局三部分异构图（基序-分子-属性连接），引入化学基序节点捕获长程组成模式；在局部层面为每个节点构建子图并分别编码，使模型关注最相关的邻近分子和基序。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试上的实验表明，该方法持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文相结合，能够有效推进稳健的少样本分子属性预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

*Yunuo Zhang,Baiting Luo,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Gabor Karsai,Abhishek Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的POMDP信念分布近似框架，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束来准确捕捉高维多模态信念分布，解决了现有方法在复杂不确定性结构建模上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，POMDP中的信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，导致现有信念近似方法无法准确表示高维多模态信念分布，造成估计误差和次优决策行为。

Method: ESCORT扩展了SVGD，引入两个关键创新：相关感知投影（建模状态维度间的依赖关系）和时间一致性约束（稳定更新同时保持相关结构），保留SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学，同时准确建模复杂相关模式。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂POMDP环境中的准确信念表示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种特征选择方法，在特征收集成本高的场景下，通过优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差，平衡不同子群体间的下游预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在特征收集成本高昂（如添加调查问题或物理传感器）的场景下，如何选择有限特征，使基于这些特征训练的模型能在多个子群体上同时表现良好。

Method: 将问题构建为传统变量选择的连续松弛，使用加噪机制，无需通过模型训练过程进行反向传播。通过优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差，开发模型无关的框架。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型无关特征选择框架能够在特征收集成本约束下，平衡不同子群体的下游预测性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarBoost提出了一种分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的新方法，通过将总功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，解决了DPV系统面临的电网级数据缺失、容量变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集中式光伏预测方法难以应用于分布式光伏系统，因为DPV面临电网级数据缺失、安装容量时间变化、地理变异性和面板多样性等挑战。

Method: 将总功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，每个电网输出使用单位输出函数乘以其容量进行建模，将同质单位输出函数与动态容量解耦以实现准确预测。

Result: 通过在中国多个城市的部署验证，SolarBoost显著减少了潜在损失，为电网运行提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: SolarBoost通过电网级建模方法有效解决了分布式光伏系统预测的挑战，证明了该方法在理论和实验上的优越性。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于双层次DDPG的调度框架，将医疗物联网中的顺序工作流调度分解为全局层选择和局部节点分配，以最小化工作流完成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗物联网需要严格的端到端延迟保证，而顺序工作流在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上的调度是NP难问题。

Method: 采用双层次DDPG强化学习框架，全局控制器选择计算层（边缘、雾或云），局部控制器处理选定层内的节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂性增加，该框架相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，对复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景具有重要意义。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的训练方法，通过在标准强化学习损失中增加额外损失项，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，从而降低不良输出的概率，改善期望奖励与不良输出概率之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常会牺牲平均性能。为了改善这种权衡，需要一种既能保持平均奖励又能有效减少不良输出的方法。

Method: RePULSe在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失项，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明，与标准RL对齐方法和替代方法相比，RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间提供了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe通过引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，有效改善了语言模型对齐中期望奖励与不良输出概率之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Conclusion: 该框架为聚类分析提供了统一的数学基础，鲁棒变体能够有效处理异常值，所有算法具有理论收敛保证，为聚类方法的发展提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型遗忘方法，通过擦除和修复两个阶段来消除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的额外微调即可实现模型净化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，导致隐私泄露风险，需要在不重新训练的情况下消除这些记忆。

Method: 采用擦除和修复两阶段方法：1)重置最后几层特定神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2)避免记忆敏感信息的微调。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘训练轮次，模型即可被净化，信息泄露数量显著减少。

Conclusion: SANI方法对医院等行业特别有用，可以在共享模型前有效净化已训练模型中的敏感信息。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Motivation: 气象领域产生大量数据，具有高容量、高维度、缺失值常见和变量间高度相关等特点，需要利用大数据和数据挖掘技术从这些数据中提取有用知识来预测天气现象。

Method: 收集开放数据并加载到本地NoSQL数据库中，在不同时空聚合级别融合数据，使用单变量和多变量方法进行预测分析，对于高缺失值情况使用邻近站点的训练数据进行预测。

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于主从合同设计的双层最大-最大优化框架，通过机器学习技术（隐式微分和共轭梯度法）高效计算超梯度，解决了非线性效用、随机动态或高维行动等复杂环境下的合同设计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的线性-二次模型（如Holmstr"om-Milgrom）有闭式解，但现实环境中存在非线性效用、随机动态或高维行动时通常无法获得解析解。本文旨在开发一个不依赖闭式解的通用算法框架。

Method: 采用现代机器学习技术进行双层优化，使用隐式微分结合共轭梯度法（CG）通过Hessian-向量积高效计算超梯度，无需形成或求逆Hessian矩阵。

Result: 在基准CARA-Normal环境中，该方法能够恢复已知的解析最优解并从随机初始化可靠收敛。由于矩阵无关、方差减少且与问题无关，该框架可扩展到复杂非线性合同设计。

Conclusion: 该框架为合同设计提供了新的计算工具，使得系统研究那些在分析上难以处理的模型成为可能，可应用于sigmoidal工资计划、相对绩效/锦标赛补偿、多任务合同和CARA-Poisson计数模型等复杂场景。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口属性方面。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息的子空间，同时保留语义内容；通过经验噪声注入增强去偏效果；提出统一的跨人口投影方法同时处理多个属性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Conclusion: CoD通过利用反事实解释，能够在少样本场景下更有效地进行知识蒸馏，帮助学生模型更好地模仿教师模型的决策边界。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GenReview数据集，这是迄今为止最大的包含LLM生成审稿意见的数据集，涵盖ICLR 2018-2025年的81K条审稿意见，用于研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在科学同行评审中的潜在使用增加，需要全面数据集来理解其效用和影响。现有研究缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 创建GenReview数据集，通过为ICLR 2018-2025所有投稿提供三种独立提示（负面、正面、中性）生成81K条LLM审稿意见，并与原始论文和审稿意见关联。

Result: 研究发现：LLM在审稿中存在偏见；LLM生成的审稿意见目前可被自动检测；LLM不能总是严格遵循审稿指南；LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集为研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了宝贵资源，揭示了LLM审稿的局限性，如偏见和指南遵循问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [136] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成对铰链损失的新型二阶代理损失函数，用于优化AUC性能，解决了传统方法在非凸、不连续损失和大规模应用中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，特别是在类别不平衡场景下。但最小化AUC面临挑战：成对0/1损失的非凸性和不连续性导致优化困难，实例级存储的内存成本在大规模应用中造成瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种新的二阶代理损失函数，基于成对铰链损失，并开发了高效的在线算法。不同于传统方法用实例级代理函数近似每个成对0/1损失项，该方法引入新范式，直接用训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量构建的代理损失函数替代整个聚合的成对损失。

Result: 理论上，现有在线AUC优化算法通常达到O(√T)遗憾界，而该方法获得了更紧的O(ln T)界。通过核基公式将框架扩展到非线性设置。在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提二阶代理损失在优化在线AUC性能方面的优越效率和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶代理损失函数为在线AUC优化提供了一种高效有效的方法，解决了传统方法的关键限制，并在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Conclusion: 合成先验的多样性和独特性是表格基础模型泛化能力的关键，Mitra的成功验证了精心设计的合成先验混合策略的有效性。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

TL;DR: ADaMoRE是一个无监督的图神经网络框架，通过混合残差专家架构和结构感知路由机制，解决了传统GNN在多样化图结构上的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN的固定消息传递架构难以适应现实世界图的多样性，而现有的图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专门残差专家捕获多样化计算模式，使用结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，通过统一无监督目标进行端到端训练。

Result: 在16个基准测试中验证了ADaMoRE在无监督节点分类和少样本学习中的最先进性能，具有优越的泛化能力、训练效率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE通过无监督训练异构MoE，有效提升了图神经网络在多样化图和任务上的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Result: 在多个晶格尺寸上验证了物理保真度，且在大晶格尺寸下比蒙特卡洛生成更快。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Result: 综合实验证明FDAs在模型融合中的有效性，且与参数空间模型融合方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs框架为联合多任务训练和后验融合提供了桥梁，提供了鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Conclusion: 通过对抗训练成功构建了神经网络世界模型中的最混淆实例，发现模型不确定性是影响混淆程度的关键因素。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability

Conclusion: 提出的Wideformer方法通过并行聚合和消息优先级机制，成功解决了图注意力中的过度聚合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本局限性，在真实域适应场景中展现出有效性和通用性

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的集成策略是在噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效方法。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: DVC是首个系统处理神经网络分层数据评估的方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Conclusion: 研究为计算GAMs多样化解释的可行性提供了严谨的理论图景，明确了在何种条件下此类计算是可能的或可证明是困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，用于在训练数据被污染的情况下更新异常检测模型的输出，通过整合预训练模型和经典异常检测方法提供的证据来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的异常检测数据集通常包含未被检测到或错误标记的异常，导致现有方法性能显著下降，且现有解决方案需要访问训练流程、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出，整合预训练模型（如CLIP）、经典异常检测方法（如潜在异常因子）或领域特定知识提供的证据。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业异常检测数据集上验证了有效性，消融研究表明对超参数影响和不同污染水平具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD在不同异常检测模型和证据对中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染问题提供了有效的测试时自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于摊销变分推理的概率框架，直接近似真实标签的后验分布，用于部分标签学习，在准确性和效率方面达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常存在噪声和歧义，部分标签学习面临早期方法计算密集、深度学习方法依赖代理损失和启发式标签精炼的问题

Method: 使用摊销变分推理，通过神经网络从输入数据预测变分参数来直接近似真实标签的后验分布

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法结合了深度学习的表达能力和概率建模的严谨性，同时保持架构无关性

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注建模选择对模型多样性的影响，而数据在塑造多样性方面的关键作用被相对忽视。作者希望从最细粒度的角度——单数据点差异对多样性的影响进行研究。

Method: 引入了相邻数据集框架来分析单数据点差异对多样性的影响，通过严格的数学证明验证发现。然后将该框架扩展到主动学习和数据插补两个实际领域，提出了多重性感知的数据获取策略和插补技术。

Result: 发现了一个看似反直觉的结果：类间分布重叠更大的相邻数据集表现出更低的模型多样性，这是由于共享的Rashomon参数导致的。在主动学习和数据插补应用中，新提出的多重性感知方法优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 数据在模型多样性中扮演着关键角色，类间分布重叠与多样性的关系与传统预期相反。基于相邻数据集框架提出的多重性感知方法在实践应用中表现优异，为理解和控制模型多样性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析自适应优化器（如Adam和Muon）在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，揭示了低精度训练保持有效性的理论原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速扩展，低精度训练对于减少内存、提高效率至关重要。然而现有自适应优化器的收敛理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释为什么低精度训练仍然有效。

Method: 引入理论框架分析自适应优化器在梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化下的收敛性，在平滑非凸目标下推导收敛速率，明确量化不同组件的量化误差如何影响收敛。

Result: 分析表明，只要尾数长度与迭代次数呈对数关系增长，两种算法都能保持接近全精度对应物的收敛速率。Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 这些结果缩小了低精度训练方法的实证成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论分析。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Motivation: 传统随机多臂老虎机中的遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配中的公平性问题，特别是在需要跨群体公平分配奖励的场景中。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加性Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到次高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该方法实现了接近最优的Nash遗憾，并推广到p-均值遗憾类公平性度量，在所有p值上统一证明(接近)最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 相比现有需要专门算法设计和强假设的方法，本文提出的简单算法在更弱假设下实现了更好的公平性遗憾性能。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Motivation: 随着超人类模型日益复杂，人类可能无法有效监督其行为。现有弱到强泛化方法在分布偏移下会失效，导致强模型表现甚至不如弱监督者。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信的监督源。

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务上，RAVEN在分布外任务上比基线方法提升超过30%，在分布内任务上表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: RAVEN能够有效解决分布偏移下的弱到强泛化问题，自动选择更准确的弱模型进行监督，为超人类模型的监督提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Conclusion: ScoreNF提供了一种减少对计算昂贵MCMC训练数据依赖的有效采样方法，并提出了评估模式覆盖和模式崩溃行为的方法。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解释中已达到或超越人类专家水平，但临床实践中需要让临床医生了解何时以及为何信任算法推荐，实现有效的AI集成。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用导向的用户研究，在三种条件下对多导睡眠图中的夜间觉醒事件进行评分：(i)手动评分，(ii)黑盒AI辅助，(iii)透明白盒AI辅助。辅助在评分开始时或作为事后质量控制提供。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为生成相关流形（GCM）的计算高效方法，通过Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵生成合成数据，数学上保证保留从简单成对关系到高阶交互的完整相关结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法往往只能复制简单的汇总统计量，但无法保留定义真实世界系统中复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，该方法通过数学证明能够保留源数据集的完整相关结构。

Result: 该方法能够生成保留完整相关结构的合成数据，包括从简单成对关系到高阶交互的所有相关结构。

Conclusion: GCM方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超参数优化过程中期望根据预期性能改进与额外计算成本的权衡来提前停止的问题，实现成本敏感的HPO。

Method: 在冻结-解冻框架中引入效用函数，结合新的采集函数和停止准则，动态选择最有潜力的配置继续训练，并改进现有方法的样本效率。

Result: 在标准多保真度HPO基准测试中，算法优于所有考虑的冻结-解冻BO和迁移BO基线方法，在成本与性能之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的成本敏感HPO方法在冻结-解冻BO框架下有效平衡了计算成本与性能，显著提升了优化效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解纠缠表示学习方法严重依赖因子特定的策略，当新变异因子不符合先验假设或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，导致显著开销。

Method: 根据因子特定的重组规则随机重混合潜在变量，通过先验损失和组合一致性损失强制编码器发现混合策略反映的因子结构。

Result: 在属性和对象解纠缠方面表现出竞争性性能，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解纠缠。

Conclusion: 通过调整混合策略即可实现属性、对象甚至两者的解纠缠，无需修改目标或架构，为解纠缠表示学习提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEEDEE是一个用于强化学习时间序列的OOD检测器，使用两个简单统计量（episodewise均值和RBF核相似度）来捕捉全局和局部偏差，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要开发有效的OOD检测方法。

Method: 提出DEEDEE检测器，仅使用episodewise均值和RBF核相似度两个统计量，与训练摘要进行比较，捕捉互补的全局和局部偏差。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中匹配或超越当代检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 提出自扩散框架，无需预训练生成模型即可解决逆问题，通过交替加噪和去噪步骤逐步优化解估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散方法需要预训练模型来学习反向噪声过程，限制了灵活性和适应性。自扩散旨在开发一个自包含的迭代过程，不依赖外部预训练模型

Method: 自扩散框架包含交替的加噪和去噪步骤。在每一步中，对当前估计添加噪声，然后使用随机初始化的单卷积网络作为自去噪器，通过数据保真度损失进行训练来预测解

Result: 在线性逆问题上，自扩散方法取得了与其他方法相当或更优的性能表现

Conclusion: 自扩散通过利用神经网络的光谱偏置和调度噪声过程，提供了一种灵活且广泛适用的逆问题解决方法，无需依赖预训练模型

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

*Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Ming-Yue Yang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法，在精度和训练效率上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效的物理信息学习方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过优化由初始条件、边界条件和控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量来确定输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的最小二乘问题。

Result: 案例研究表明，PIELM相比传统PINNs方法，相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级的预测精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，在精度和效率方面都优于传统PINNs方法。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模网络系统（如交通、电力、无线网络）在规模和环境变化方面对强化学习智能体构成挑战，需要同时解决可扩展性和领域泛化问题。

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响动态的最小邻域变量，获得近似紧凑表示；元actor-critic在多个源域上训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新域因子来部署适应策略。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法，并建立了因果恢复、actor-critic收敛和适应差距的有限样本保证。

Conclusion: GSAC框架成功解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化挑战，通过因果表示学习和元学习实现了高效的学习和快速适应。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，提高离线强化学习的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如决策变换器存在冗余令牌化和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发UTR表示法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单一令牌；构建基于变换器的UDT和基于门控CNN的UDC两个变体。

Result: 两种变体在显著降低计算量的同时，达到或超越了最先进方法的性能；理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Conclusion: UTR在不同架构上泛化良好，为未来大规模决策模型的可扩展控制提供了高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

TL;DR: ParaRNN框架通过牛顿迭代和并行归约技术，首次实现了非线性RNN的序列并行化训练，解决了传统RNN因顺序计算而无法并行化的根本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN的固有顺序性限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行化架构如Transformer和状态空间模型在线性约束下表达能力有限，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列建模为单一方程组系统，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约技术进行并行求解。

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的非线性RNN模型（LSTM和GRU变体），在困惑度指标上与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2架构相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN突破了非线性RNN的序列并行化障碍，为大规模非线性序列建模开辟了新途径，并开源了代码框架以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都至关重要。用户上传的照片可能强化或证明他们对物品的看法，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最佳说服论据。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐本身学习是可行的，这种方法不仅能提高推荐系统的可信度，还能为公司提供关于客户偏好的宝贵洞察。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性和治疗分配机制的交互会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响治疗效果估计准确性。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，在未知暴露映射下估计治疗效果，并减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet能够有效处理网络环境中的干扰问题，在未知暴露映射和存在协变量偏移的情况下提供准确的治疗效果估计。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的均匀收敛框架，引入Uniform Mean Estimability（UME-learnability）概念，研究分布集合在任意估计器下能否实现均匀均值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要关注经验均值估计器的均匀收敛（P-Glivenko-Cantelli），本文旨在超越这一限制，研究更一般的均匀均值可估计性问题。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件，并构造非可分但UME可学习的分布集合。

Result: 证明均值向量的可分性是UME可学习的充分条件，但不是必要条件；构造了非可分但UME可学习的反例；证明UME可学习集合的可数并集也是UME可学习的。

Conclusion: 解决了Cohen等人（2025）提出的猜想，建立了均匀均值可估计性的理论基础，揭示了可分性条件与UME可学习性之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络能够根据奖励函数采样高奖励的复杂对象，但奖励函数通常从噪声数据中近似估计，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性

Method: 构建基于多项式混沌展开的代理模型，在小规模训练流网络集合上拟合，学习低维参数化奖励函数与流网络轨迹中各步骤动作概率分布之间的关系

Result: 代理模型可用于廉价的蒙特卡洛采样，估计在不确定奖励下策略的不确定性，在离散和连续网格世界、符号回归和贝叶斯结构学习任务中验证了性能

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化生成流网络在奖励函数不确定时的策略不确定性，通过廉价采样提供可靠的不确定性估计

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)用于无人机灾后道路评估路由，同时处理8种变体问题，通过单一神经网络训练实现参数和训练时间减少8倍，并在解质量上优于单任务DRL方法6-14%和传统优化方法24-82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后道路评估对应急响应至关重要，但现有无人机路由方法存在扩展性差、需要领域专业知识、单任务模型缺乏适应性等问题，无法满足动态灾害场景的需求。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构训练单一神经网络处理多种问题配置，通过轻量级适配器机制实现对新属性的高效微调而无需重新训练。

Result: UM在1000节点网络中实现实时解(1-10秒)，相比训练单独模型减少8倍参数和训练时间，在收集信息总值上优于对比方法，并通过敏感性分析验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UM为时间关键型应用推进了神经组合优化，提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的无人机灾后道路评估解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用探针作为训练信号时的可靠性问题，提出了两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的方法，发现在偏好优化中探针检测性保持得更好，且探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针能检测模型内部的不良行为，但将其作为训练目标时可能因Goodhart定律而失效，需要研究如何在使用探针训练时保持其可靠性。

Method: 提出了基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的两种训练方法，在毒性减少测试平台上进行实验，评估了探针准确率下降情况，并尝试了探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针三种策略。

Result: 偏好优化方法比分类器方法更好地保持了探针检测性；探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中可行，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本没有必要。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过增强弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性，解决了传统对抗训练在视频级弱监督下效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型对对抗攻击脆弱，但由于弱监督仅提供视频级标签而需要帧级预测，传统对抗训练方法效果不佳。伪标签虽能实现帧级对抗训练，但噪声严重影响性能。

Method: 提出时空区域扭曲（SRD）方法，通过对正常视频中的局部区域施加严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性，结合精确标注的合成异常和噪声伪标签来减少标签噪声。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了WSVAD模型对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效减少了伪标签噪声，实现了有效的对抗训练，显著增强了弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，引入切除分数(ES)作为新的静态评估指标，通过移除共享内容来专注比较修订差异区域，在代码编辑评估中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标(如BLEU)在处理文档修订时存在根本缺陷，它们被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断。

Method: 提出切除分数(ES)，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与修订版本间的共享内容，然后比较剩余差异区域，并通过近似算法将计算复杂度从立方降至平方。

Result: 在HumanEvalFix数据集上，ES比最接近的竞争者SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准指标如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES的优势进一步扩大。

Conclusion: ES是一个有效的修订相似性度量，能够正确处理共享内容、代码块移动、插入删除等复杂情况，与人类判断更一致。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Motivation: 低空经济(LAE)快速发展需要灵活广域的计算服务，但SAGIN-MEC在LAE中面临异构节点协调、复杂因素建模和部分可观测环境下实时决策等挑战。

Method: 提出分层SAGIN-MEC架构，并设计MADDPG-COCG算法：使用MADDPG优化连续时间决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈方法处理混合变维决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比基准算法，MADDPG-COCG显著降低了用户设备总成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，仅略微增加无人机能耗，且具有更好的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法有效解决了SAGIN-MEC中的复杂优化问题，为低空经济提供了高效的计算服务解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，有助于构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Motivation: 神经网络擅长处理非结构化数据但泛化能力差，而经典算法保证正确性但缺乏灵活性，探索将两者结合能否提升GNN在分子预测任务上的表现。

Method: 使用CLRS算法推理基准中的24个经典算法预训练GNN，然后将预训练模型的部分层冻结并用于初始化分子预测的第二个GNN。

Result: 相比随机初始化基线，预训练模型在ogbg-molhiv任务上获得6%绝对提升，在ogbg-molclintox上获得3%提升，表现出一致的优势或持平。

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNN能为复杂的真实世界图数据提供有用的归纳偏置，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: REVE推动了EEG研究的标准化，为临床神经科学提供了加速发展的工具。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少数据生成所需的时间步数，降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，计算和时耗巨大。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数并降采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法，将两个解函数（一个为主函数，另一个为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点；最后计算原始方程右端项变化形成新解对。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度，在Navier-Stokes方程上生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为解决非线性时间偏微分方程的数据生成问题提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，证明了即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能，这是SBM和DCBM无法实现的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图聚类模型的局限性，特别是SBM假设顶点度均匀和DCBM在簇间应用统一度校正的问题，PABM引入独立的簇内和簇间连接流行度参数。

Method: 提出PABM模型，分析其理论特性，证明最优聚类误差率，并通过数值实验验证使用k^2个特征向量的谱聚类算法优于传统方法。

Result: PABM的期望邻接矩阵秩在k到k^2之间，传统基于前k个特征向量的谱嵌入可能丢失重要结构信息，实验证实使用k^2个特征向量的谱聚类性能更优。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度，局部连接模式差异可独立于全局边密度增强簇可分性，为图聚类提供了新的理论洞见。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀疏的领域（如机器人操作、分子物理等）中，等变网络可以改善对输入空间欠采样部分的建模，但等变性与模型置信度、模型校准之间的关系尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过证明在不同等变条件下不确定性校准误差（ECE和ENCE）的下界和上界，构建理论框架，并结合真实和模拟数据集进行数值实验，分析对称性不匹配、群大小以及偶然性和认知性不确定性的影响。

Result: 理论分析揭示了等变模型的泛化界限，表明对称性不匹配会导致分类和回归任务中的校准错误。数值实验进一步阐明了等变性与不确定性之间的关系模式。

Conclusion: 等变性对模型的不确定性估计有重要影响，对称性不匹配是导致模型校准错误的关键因素，这为理解等变模型的泛化能力和不确定性提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.
