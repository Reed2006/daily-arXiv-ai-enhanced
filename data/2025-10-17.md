### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性，在MultiSpider数据集上显著提升了执行准确率和语义准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽视了语义对齐挑战，包括查询语义含义和执行结果的正确性。从英语到其他语言时，执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)框架结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来提升SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，LLaMA-3-3B模型经过GRPO微调后，执行准确率提升至87.4%(+26pp)，语义准确率提升至52.29%(+32.86pp)。加入对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%(+6.85pp)。

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励信号进行定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的性能，较小的3B模型能够超越更大的8B模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了生成式操作框架，利用大语言模型作为翻译引擎，将技术性XAI输出转化为临床可读的叙述，以解决心理健康筛查中XAI的临床实用性差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP和LIME）虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床的转化障碍。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，使用LLM作为核心翻译引擎，结合RAG技术将XAI技术输出与临床指南融合，自动生成人类可读的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流集成、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍。

Conclusion: 为从孤立数据点生成转向提供集成、可操作且可信赖的临床AI提供了战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA是一种公开可验证的水印框架，通过基于词性n-gram的语言自由度动态调整水印强度，在保持文本质量的同时增强检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型特定信号（如logits），阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信息的公开可验证水印方案。

Method: 使用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文中减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的上下文中增强信号以提高可检测性。检测器无需访问模型logits。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和黏着性韩语等多种语言类型上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度动态调整水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过用户比较模式收集成对偏好数据的新方法，利用模型不对称性推断用户数据质量，开发EM算法估计用户潜在质量因子，用于LLM对齐的数据过滤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，成本高。用户在日常使用中产生大量偏好标签，但缺乏质量控制。用户最了解自己查询的响应质量，但需要解决数据质量问题。

Method: 从两个不同模型或同一模型的不同版本生成两个响应，利用不对称性推断用户数据质量。提出用户行为模型，开发期望最大化(EM)算法估计用户潜在质量因子，据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式是收集成对偏好数据的可行替代方案，通过模型不对称性和质量估计可以有效解决用户标注数据的质量控制问题。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"知情路由"的新范式，通过轻量级特征预测器(LFF)评估token的重要性和可恢复性，实现灵活的执行或近似策略，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，导致不可逆信息丢失和次优token选择，限制了LLMs在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 引入知情路由范式，使用轻量级特征预测器(LFF)在路由决策前估计单元输出，实现执行或近似策略，避免信息损失。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上实现最先进的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地评估token重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了现有贪婪路由方法的局限性，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES剪枝方法，结合注意力熵和头重要性分数，相比仅使用HIS的方法在模型质量和稳定性上分别提升15.2%和2.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多层多头结构导致推理效率问题，现有的基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性

Method: 提出HIES剪枝准则，将头重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供互补的头部贡献证据

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝在模型质量上提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现显著模型压缩而不损失精度或稳定性

Conclusion: HIES方法有效克服了HIS的局限性，通过整合注意力熵信息实现了更优的剪枝效果

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流生成的1,420个问题，以及首个支持系统评估对话数据分析工具的评价系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分析任务往往目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解和澄清用户意图，而现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或提供一流的交互支持。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从描述公共数据集洞察的文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1,420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了评估工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续、长形式交互的任务上表现并不更好。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型在完成复杂交互任务方面进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的不确定性量化方法，提出了基于相似性的黑盒UQ框架，能在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等任务中提供更准确的置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不确定性量化是可信AI系统的关键组件，黑盒UQ方法具有适应性强、成本低等优势，但需要有效的方法来评估LLM对其生成内容的置信度。

Method: 提出了基于相似性的非语言化聚合框架，通过比较生成输出与其他采样生成的一致性来估计置信度，并引入了使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的基于相似性的方法比基线方法能产生更好校准的置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒UQ框架为复杂生成任务提供了有效的置信度估计方法，能够提高LLM输出可信度评估的准确性。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的认定标准存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能有效解决仇恨言论检测中的数据稀疏性、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分关系形式）的方法，该方法优于现有的BERT基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时、昂贵且费力，而数字时代需要组织大量非结构化文本，特别是在电子商务领域需要适当的产品组织。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分关系形式）的全自动化方法。

Result: 该方法生成的本体在使用LLM作为评判标准时，超越了现有的基于BERT的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为在大语言模型更广泛地应用于（产品或其他）本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对RAG事实核查系统的知识投毒攻击方法，能够在极低投毒率下有效翻转事实核查决策并诱导欺骗性解释，无需访问目标模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，传统攻击在可信证据主导的检索环境中效果有限。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击方法：少样本、语义对齐的投毒技术，通过多注入策略操纵检索内容，无需目标LLM或检索器访问权限。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT在极低投毒率(0.93×10^-6)下平均攻击成功率86%，比现有最佳方法提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界RAG事实核查系统的严重漏洞，即使存在强反证也能保持攻击效果。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域优化的基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化来更好地捕捉患者就诊间的纵向依赖关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格化、事件化特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 扩展SciBERT模型，在结构化电子健康记录序列上进行额外预训练，设计用于编码临床事件间的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务中，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的电子健康记录表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的表现。

Conclusion: 医疗基础模型预训练中时间序列化的重要性得到了验证，SerialBEHRT能够产生更丰富的患者表示。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态词汇表剪裁方法，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量词汇簇，动态构建起草模型的词汇短列表，从而加速推测解码中的起草阶段，同时保持验证阶段的完整词汇表和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法中，起草模型的输出头参数随着词汇表规模增长成为延迟瓶颈。现有的固定词汇子集方法虽然减少计算量，但存在脆弱性：频率列表依赖语料库需要重新调整，静态短列表抑制罕见或领域特定词汇，降低每次验证步骤的预期接受令牌数。

Method: 引入轻量级粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到少量词汇簇；选择的前k个簇的并集形成起草模型的短列表；通过并行执行起草编码和元短列表选择，元分类器在起草模型隐藏状态生成前完成计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，DynaSpec在平均接受长度上获得一致增益，同时上下文相关选择使得可以使用更小的短列表而不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速起草并能泛化到多样化任务的动态短列表机制，解决了传统固定词汇子集方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器之上添加可学习投影层，保持效率的同时减少计算开销，避免大量重新训练或顺序处理。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在云端和移动设备上都能良好运行且速度快，Android应用能无缝执行组合任务。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要高速操作和资源受限的实际应用中具有潜在优势，展示了组合多任务处理的实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

### [15] [Language steering in latent space to mitigate unintended code-switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13849)
*Andrey Goncharov,Nikolai Kondusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言大模型中的代码切换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，这会降低下游任务的可靠性。

Method: 使用PCA在平行翻译数据上识别语言方向，然后沿着这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，该方法只需要最少的平行数据进行校准。

Result: 实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上，跨多个语言对的下一token分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份表征集中在最后几层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能以可忽略的计算开销减轻代码切换问题，同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现成功的LLM推理具有全局非均匀的信息密度特征，这与人类沟通模式相反，挑战了机器推理的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，旨在分析LLM推理过程中的信息流模式，解决中间步骤不忠实或难以解释的问题。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行实验。

Result: 发现成功的LLM推理表现出信息密度的不均匀波动，与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 这一发现挑战了关于机器推理的假设，为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰的模型编辑方法，能够在长编辑序列中保持知识稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在顺序编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新和保留知识。

Method: 通过为每个传入编辑执行顺序零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示，在保留知识上保持输出不变性。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进的定位-编辑技术，速度提升最高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在动态演化信息环境中开发更原则性LLM设计方法的必要性，同时提供了一个简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准，用于衡量不同用户角色下大语言模型的事实一致性。实验发现不同模型的事实一致性差异显著，且受提供商和话题影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在面对不同用户角色时是否提供事实一致的回答，确保模型输出的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用19个LLM，为15个话题各请求5个事实，重复100次并添加不同用户角色上下文，通过句子嵌入和跨角色余弦相似度计算事实一致性分数。

Result: 100角色实验中，事实一致性分数范围为0.9065-0.7896，平均0.8656。xAI的Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型表现最差。不同话题一致性差异明显。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性受提供商和话题影响，需要开发角色不变提示策略来确保公平输出。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BenchPress是一个人类在环系统，通过RAG和LLM为SQL查询生成自然语言描述，加速领域特定文本到SQL基准的创建，减少人工标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果较差。手动标注SQL日志以创建基准既困难又昂贵。

Method: 给定SQL查询，使用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM生成多个自然语言描述草案，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性和领域对齐。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准所需的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性和基准可靠性。

Conclusion: BenchPress为研究人员和从业者提供了一种评估文本到SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制，结合人类验证和LLM生成建议增强了基准创建效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

*Mamadou K. Keita,Christopher Homan,Sebastien Diarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Rule-to-Tag（R2T）框架，将语言规则集成到神经网络训练目标中，通过自适应损失函数处理词汇外单词，在无标注文本上训练的词性标注模型达到98.2%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索原则性学习（PrL）范式，让模型在明确的任务约束下训练，而不仅仅依赖标注样本，特别是在资源稀缺语言中解决词汇外单词问题。

Method: R2T框架将多层级语言规则直接集成到神经网络训练目标中，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来教授模型处理词汇外单词的原则性不确定性。

Result: 在Zarma语词性标注任务中，仅使用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率，优于在300个标注句子上微调的AfriBERTa基线；在命名实体识别任务中，R2T预训练模型在仅50个标注句子上微调后，性能优于在300个句子上训练的基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架成功展示了原则性学习的有效性，通过将语言规则集成到训练过程中，能够在资源稀缺场景下实现高性能，并为复杂任务提供强大的预训练基础。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一个即插即用的技术，通过利用模型一致性来提高LLM集成的鲁棒性，解决因分词方案差异和模型专长不同导致的错误信号问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同LLM具有互补能力，但现有集成方法对错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，这些错误信号通常源于异构分词方案和模型专长差异。

Method: 提出CoRE技术，包含两个层面的处理：1) 分词级一致性：使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重；2) 模型级一致性：提升高自信度且与其他模型差异小的模型输出的权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过利用模型一致性，有效提高了LLM集成的鲁棒性，可以无缝集成到各种集成方法中。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答(MedVQA)中伤口护理的特定需求，支持临床决策和患者护理，通过自然语言查询医疗图像。

Method: 采用通用领域指令调优大语言模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)框架，整合领域内文本和视觉示例，无需额外训练或复杂重排。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第三，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和基于LLM的指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLM结合提供了一个简单有效的多模态临床NLP任务基线方法，通过最小推理时间层添加相关示例即可提升性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: ShishuLM是一种高效的语言模型架构，通过减少参数数量和KV缓存需求，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存占用和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著的内存和计算冗余，特别是在小型语言模型(SLMs)中，这为优化提供了机会。

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝的研究，发现中等上下文场景下归一化和注意力计算近似线性，从而可以用MLP近似整个transformer块。

Result: 与父模型相比，ShishuLM在训练和推理阶段分别减少25%内存需求和40%延迟。

Conclusion: 该研究为从预训练角度构建更高效的SLM架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个集成LLM框架，用于大规模分析AI辅导对话中的情感动态，发现学生在与AI导师互动时通常呈现轻度积极情感和中度唤醒，但学习过程并不平稳，困惑和好奇是常见伴随状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM介导的辅导中的情感动态仍未得到充分理解。本研究旨在通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态，推进将生成式AI负责任地整合到教育中的途径。

Method: 分析了两个学期中16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）生成零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分，以及自由文本情感标签。通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合这些估计。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中度唤醒。困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随状态，沮丧虽然较少见但仍会出现。情感状态短暂易变，积极时刻稍长但脆弱易受干扰。负面情感通常快速解决，中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 中性时刻经常充当转折点，更倾向于引导学生向上而非向下发展，这为导师在这些关键时刻进行干预提供了机会，强调了在AI辅导中关注情感动态的重要性。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，比基线方法持续提升17.01%；在多令牌生成设置中提供额外优势，能在保持生成质量的同时实现有效加速

Conclusion: 模板填充方法为扩散语言模型提供了专门定制的调节方法，显著提升了推理性能，特别是在多令牌生成场景中表现出色

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic

composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，通过在解码器语言模型的每个注意力/MLP分支添加sigmoid线性门，实现基于令牌重要性的层跳过，显著减少推理计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型存在不稳定性和需要大量重新训练的问题，需要一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的轻量级层跳过方法。

Method: 在注意力/MLP分支输出端添加可微分的sigmoid线性门，根据门值对令牌进行排序，按每层预算跳过低重要性令牌，无需重新训练整个模型。

Result: 在长文本推理任务中节省15%计算量同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型上，全计算量时准确率提升，50%节省时仍能匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定高效的层跳过方法，不仅减少计算开销，还揭示了transformer信息流动模式，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 该研究引入了一个新的基准测试，让LLM在多臂老虎机环境中仅使用文本反馈进行顺序决策，发现Qwen3-4B模型在最佳臂选择率上达到89.2%，显著优于其他LLM和传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在仅使用自然语言反馈的情况下，在不确定性环境中进行顺序决策的能力，目前这方面研究尚未充分探索。

Method: 创建了一个基准测试，LLM在多臂老虎机环境中仅接收"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈，没有数值线索或显式概率，需要从语言线索推断潜在奖励结构并相应调整。

Result: 大多数LLM表现不如基准算法，但Qwen3-4B达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLM和传统方法（汤普森采样、ε-贪婪、UCB等）。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力能够仅从语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值情境下的决策能力迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种让语言模型动态自主调整每个输入token计算步数的监督训练方法，模型可以通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，使用<pause>token获得更多计算资源来生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入token的复杂度动态调整计算资源，在需要更多思考时请求额外计算时间，提高模型效率和准确性。

Method: 提出了Catch Your Breath损失函数类别，包括三种方法：CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚），通过微调实验确定最佳损失变体。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少一半数据。模型能根据token复杂度自适应调整处理时间，在复数名词后常暂停，在缩略词第一个token后从不暂停。

Conclusion: 该方法使语言模型能够智能地分配计算资源，根据上下文和token复杂度动态调整处理时间，显著提高训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一种简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂的辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，而非传统的封闭式选择题或简答格式，以更好地捕捉真实社会现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数LLM社会模拟研究使用封闭式设计，这忽视了LLMs固有的生成特性，无法充分模拟真实的社会现象和个体表达。

Method: 基于调查方法学研究和NLP最新进展，提出在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，捕捉话题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计，探索未预期的观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试，提升方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLMs的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在结构化文本分类任务中的实际性能，了解其局限性和改进方向。

Method: 使用统一数据集（8,660个人工标注样本）和零样本提示，对10个LLMs进行系统性评估，并开发集成方法进行对比。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，存在明显的幻觉和过度分类问题；集成方法显著提升准确率，完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 模型协调编排比单纯扩大规模更有效，集成方法是实现超越人类专家性能的有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面的进展主要关注易验证答案的任务，但生成和验证自然语言数学证明仍是一个开放挑战。缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器是主要障碍。

Method: 提出系统化方法开发验证评估器，引入ProofBench专家标注数据集，包含145个问题和435个LLM生成解。探索评估器设计空间，包括骨干模型、输入上下文、指令和工作流程，最终开发ProofGrader评估器。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上达到0.926的MAE，显著优于基线。在最佳n选择任务中，当n=16时平均得分4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader在细粒度数学证明评估方面表现出色，有潜力推动下游证明生成任务的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but

objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and

Motivation: 现有方法在高质量监督微调数据选择上过度依赖LLM内部知识、可解释性差且泛化能力有限，需要更有效的选择标准。

Conclusion: THTB框架为高效SFT提供了有效的数据选择和标注指导方法，在减少训练成本的同时显著提升模型性能，具有强大的领域适应潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且分类法有限，无法全面捕捉攻击策略的多样性。需要更深入地理解越狱技术的有效性。

Method: 通过结构化红队挑战，开发了包含7大类50种策略的层次化越狱分类法，收集挑战数据进行分析，评估基于分类法的自动检测方法，并创建意大利语多轮对抗对话数据集。

Result: 创建了全面的越狱策略分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，发现基于分类法的提示能改善自动检测效果，并建立了包含1364个多轮对抗对话的意大利语数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对越狱技术有效性的深入理解，开发了全面的分类框架，为改进LLM安全防御提供了重要工具和数据集。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，准确识别文本作者变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的作者归属方法。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和GPT-4o LLM判断器，在包含600个平衡实例的人类AI平行语料库上进行测试，涵盖学术、新闻、小说、博客、口语转录和影视剧本六个领域。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT生成文本上表现更好（82% vs 68%），而LLM判断器在LLaMA生成文本上略优（85% vs 81%）。LLM判断器在小说和学术文本中显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要结合不同方法的混合策略，因为不同方法在不同类型的文本中各有优势。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型存在明显的训练痕迹，这对AI安全研究具有重要警示意义，需要开发更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但仍容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，需要系统性地探测这些安全弱点。

Method: 将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合目标函数优化：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)拒绝感知正则化器，(iii)连贯性约束，最后通过批评引导的解码将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID相比现有白盒和黑盒基线方法，能以更少的查询和更低的计算成本获得更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Motivation: LLM在日常生活中的重要角色引发了对其在政治和道德领域潜在偏见的担忧，需要量化分析这些偏见并与人类道德推理进行比较。

Method: 应用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM在三种条件下的回应：固有回应、直接政治意识形态表征、基于人口统计的角色扮演。

Result: 研究发现LLM回应确实存在政治和意识形态倾向，与人类道德推理数据存在差异，揭示了AI生成内容的政治和人口统计依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM在道德和政治领域的回应显示出明显的意识形态倾向，这对其作为公正建议提供者的可靠性提出了重要问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

TL;DR: SA-ICL是一种基于认知科学中图式理论的上下文学习框架，通过提取示例中的认知构建块来创建抽象图式，从而增强语言模型在解决新问题时的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于示例的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面进行知识检索和转移的显式模块，而人类认知研究表明人们通过激活预先存在的心理框架（图式）来理解新信息。

Method: 从先前的示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的关键推理步骤及其关系的抽象图式模板，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL能持续提升性能（最高达36.19%），当单个演示示例质量较高时，同时减少了对演示数量的依赖并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的各种ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新途径，证明显式图式基架能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对输入提示高度敏感，但自动提示优化方法通常需要真实标签数据，而收集高质量标签成本高昂且耗时。

Method: PDO框架将问题建模为双人赌博机设置，使用LLM作为评判者提供成对偏好反馈，结合双Thompson采样和表现优异提示的变异策略。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了双Thompson采样和提示变异的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种样本高效的无标签提示优化框架，能够有效利用成对偏好反馈，并可整合部分标签来减轻评判噪声。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，先前研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而忽略了模型内部进行算术计算的结构机制。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术分析模型内部表示，并引入部分嵌入交换技术。

Result: 发现中间计算结果存在于残差流中（特别是在MLP块之后），模型在每个运算符的嵌入中线性编码优先级，部分嵌入交换技术可以成功修改运算符优先级。

Conclusion: LLMs确实在内部表示中编码了运算符优先级信息，这为理解模型算术计算机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

TL;DR: 提出KRLM模型解决归纳知识图谱推理中的LLM知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，通过知识推理语言指令格式、KRL注意力层和结构感知实体预测器实现LLM知识与KG上下文的统一协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱基础模型在处理开放域知识图谱时，LLM的内在知识容易被稀疏的KG上下文所掩盖，导致知识扭曲和生成幻觉，严重影响推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计知识推理语言指令格式和KRL分词器对齐LLM知识与KG表示；提出KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识与额外KG上下文；设计结构感知的下一个实体预测器将推理结果严格约束在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳KGR数据集上的实验结果表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景下均表现出显著优越性。

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了归纳知识图谱推理的准确性和可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有代理式RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时中间推理能力不足的问题，这些系统的中间推理能力尚未得到充分探索。

Result: 实验表明，具有更强RAGCap性能的"慢思考"模型能获得更好的端到端结果，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强中间能力对于提升代理式RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估和改进这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究将AI辩论应用于主观问题，发现语言模型倾向于迎合法官立场而非坚持自身先验信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，模型在捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时更具说服力，但矛盾的是，与先验信念不一致的论点在成对比较中被认为质量更高。


<details>

Motivation: 现有辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所辩护的主张是错误的。本研究旨在测试语言模型是否会采用迎合策略来最大化说服力，还是忠实于其先验信念。

Method: 在主观问题上应用辩论，明确测量语言模型的先验信念，让辩手选择偏好立场，然后面对与先验信念冲突的法官角色。比较了顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估系统性偏见。

Result: 模型倾向于捍卫与法官角色一致的立场而非先验信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时更具说服力；但与先验信念不一致的论点在质量比较中评分更高。

Conclusion: 这些结果可以帮助人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的人机交互重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有的网络深度研究代理在处理复杂问答任务时面临挑战，因为底层语言模型通常未针对长时程推理和探索进行优化。现有方法在构建指令调优数据集时缺乏对难度和质量的细粒度控制，且往往混淆数据和训练效果。

Method: 采用两阶段数据合成管道，通过逐步增加任务复杂度生成问答对，直到基线网络代理失败。基线代理在过程中扮演多个角色：尝试回答问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集规模较小，但训练出的网络代理在多个网络基准测试中表现优于使用现有数据集训练的模型。新数据集在工具使用动作上展现出两倍的多样性。

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法能有效生成高质量训练数据，使训练出的模型在避免重复工具调用行为的同时实现更强的性能，证明了数据质量对网络代理训练的重要性。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 反驳当前研究中将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的做法，质疑可读性在小型语言模型能力涌现中的关键作用。

Method: 构建结构匹配但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较模型在不同可读性文本上的训练表现。

Result: 模型在复杂成人文本上的表现与简化语言相当，甚至更快发展出连贯性；统计简单性是更强的学习能力预测指标。

Conclusion: 应避免将语言模型训练过度拟人化，需要更精确地理解支持小型模型能力涌现的实际属性。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Result: 该方法能够有效表示化学元素，缓解了科学文本与通用描述之间的分布差异以及数据稀疏性问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作为材料科学中AI驱动发现奠定了基础，展示了语言模型在元素属性预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Motivation: 现有PRM在TTS中的表现有时不如简单的多数投票，这引发了对如何有效利用PRM验证信号的关键问题。

Method: 开发理论框架来优化组合LLM和PRM信号，提出加权聚合策略，并通过预计算方法校准权重函数。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，该校准方法显著提升TTS效率，仅使用21.3%的计算量就超越了传统加权多数投票的性能。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算是获得性能提升的更有效途径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Conclusion: FACTS为现实世界的查询聚焦表格摘要提供了一个实用的解决方案，具有快速、准确和隐私合规的优势。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Result: 在构建的BioMedMCQs数据集上，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上均显著提升准确率：Level 1从59.1%提升至91.9%，Level 2从47.0%提升至81.0%，Level 3从36.3%提升至73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch框架能够有效提升复杂生物医学问答任务的准确性，通过多源信息整合解决了大语言模型在生物医学领域缺乏科学严谨性的问题。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著损害模型的推理、长文本理解、安全性等能力，并增加"黑暗特质"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM能力的因果影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型认知衰退。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量）进行控制实验，在4个LLM上进行持续预训练。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（Hedges' g>0.3），ARC-Challenge从74.9降至57.2，RULER-CWE从84.4降至52.3。发现思维跳跃是主要病变，指令微调和干净数据预训练只能部分恢复能力。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动因素，应将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并建议对部署的LLM进行常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在生物医学领域应用日益增多，但它们在药物安全预测中的可靠性尚未充分探索，特别是是否会将临床无关的社会人口信息纳入不良事件预测。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统的结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，评估ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同社会人口特征角色下的表现，包括三种用户角色（全科医生、专科医生、患者）。

Result: 发现不良事件预测准确率存在系统性差异，弱势群体（如低教育水平、住房不稳定）被预测的不良事件风险显著高于特权群体。识别出两种偏见模式：显性偏见和隐性偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了将大型语言模型应用于药物警戒的关键风险，强调了在临床部署前需要制定公平性评估协议和缓解策略的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过指令检索来增强小语言模型推理能力的方法，在推理时检索结构化推理指令而非生成，在多个专业领域任务上显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)虽然能在本地硬件高效运行，具有隐私保护、低成本等优势，但在需要多步推理或领域知识的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建指令语料库，将相似训练问题分组并通过GPT-5创建指令。在推理时，SLM检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤进行推理。

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU专业法律和MathQA任务上，使用3B到14B参数模型无需额外微调，指令检索带来了持续提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 指令检索能有效增强小语言模型的推理能力，简洁指令优于长指令，改进幅度强烈依赖于模型家族和内在推理能力。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Result: 揭示了这些方法在不同能力、金融市场和语言方面的优势和局限性，为未来研究提供宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度研究智能体的能力评估提供了系统框架和基准，基准和评估代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过针对特定作者进行微调，AI模型能够生成比专业作家更受读者偏好的文学文本，这对版权法中的合理使用原则提出了挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够生成高质量、模仿作者风格的文学文本，以及这对版权纠纷的影响。

Method: 采用预注册研究，比较MFA专业作家与三种前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作家风格方面的表现，通过159名专家和普通读者的盲评进行对比。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本被专家强烈否定，但经过针对特定作者微调的ChatGPT生成的文本在风格忠实度和写作质量上都受到专家和普通读者的偏好，且很少被AI检测器识别。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能够生成读者偏好的非逐字文本，这对版权法中关于"对潜在市场或价值的影响"这一合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少量高熵token主导输出正确性，而现有方法通常以效率为代价进行推理时扩展

Method: MTI包含：选择性CFG干预（仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导）和轻量级负提示引导（重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码）

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，如Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效

Conclusion: MTI是一种无需训练的方法，能以最小开销显著提升推理准确性和稳定性

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Method: 提出了新的RAG错误分类法，收集了带错误标注的RAG响应数据集，并开发了与分类法一致的自动评估方法。

Result: 创建了包含错误类型示例和实用建议的分类法，以及带标注的数据集和自动评估工具。

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统化的框架和实用工具，有助于开发过程中跟踪和解决错误。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 大多数训练语料库包含许可状态不明确的数据，限制了真正开放模型的发展，这一问题在非英语语言中尤为严重，因为公开许可的文本仍然严重稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集数据，实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复处理流程，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。

Result: 构建了包含1545.6亿个token的高质量德语文本集合，所有领域子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或同等许可，确保模型训练和再分发的法律合规性。

Conclusion: 德国Commons解决了公开许可德语预训练数据的关键缺口，使开发真正开放的德语语言模型成为可能，并发布了语料构建和数据过滤代码，使该资源完全可复现和可扩展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在不同文化背景下的推理能力，通过四个可解释指标（文化流畅性、偏差、一致性和语言适应性）分析模型解释而非仅看答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确回答不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLMs如何在跨文化语境中进行推理，而不仅仅是基于准确性的评分。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR）在50个来自世界价值观调查的文化基础问题上的表现，这些问题被翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，共分析了2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT在不同语言间适应性更强但一致性较低；FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLMs的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现的。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 语言模态会影响大语言模型的抽象推理能力，英语表现更优，模型类型也会影响性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Motivation: 检测超出范围(OOS)的用户话语是任务导向对话系统和开放集意图识别的关键挑战，现有方法通常依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块。

Method: 提出DROID框架，结合通用句子编码器(USE)进行广泛语义泛化和领域自适应Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)进行领域特定上下文区分，通过融合表示和轻量级分支分类器进行意图分离，并引入合成和开放域异常增强来改善边界学习。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，DROID在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线方法，已知意图的macro-F1提高6-15%，OOS意图提高8-20%，在低资源设置中增益最显著。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示结合简单校准可以为神经对话系统提供鲁棒、可扩展和可靠的OOS检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet
deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific
models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，利用强化学习框架提升基础模型的指令遵循能力，在AlpacaEval基准上取得26.34%胜率，优于SFT的21.01%，SFT+RLSR组合可进一步提升至30.73%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望利用丰富的SFT数据集在强化学习框架中改进基础模型的指令遵循能力，替代传统的监督微调方法

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应的余弦相似度作为奖励分数

Result: RLSR单独使用在Qwen-7B上AlpacaEval胜率达26.34%，优于SFT的21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%胜率

Conclusion: RLSR可作为SFT的有效替代方案，显著提升指令遵循能力，且与SFT结合能获得更好的下游任务性能

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色档案（如精选信息和个性特征）而受损，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并精炼角色档案以减少这些差异。

Result: 在四种不同行为预测场景（正式辩论、社交媒体心理健康帖子、公开访谈、电影评论）上评估，DPRF能持续显著改善行为对齐，并在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色档案提供了稳健方法，增强了用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI等下游应用的有效性。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但增加了延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）由于阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成两个关键挑战，难以平衡效率与准确性。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算和基于置信度的在线生成早期退出机制，抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试上，LiteStage实现最高1.70倍加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的延迟问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率，为小语言模型的推理加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop一致性（F²C）无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLMs对提示扰动的鲁棒性，在11个数据集上平均提升一致性11.62%，F1分数8.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在面对相同提示的不同表述时产生不一致答案的问题，提高模型对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：1）共识交叉熵（CCE）使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；2）表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上，F²C平均提升一致性11.62%，F1分数8.94%，减少性能方差3.29%。在域外评估和保留格式测试中也表现良好。

Conclusion: F²C是增强LLMs在提示扰动下一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: 提出MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转变为主动理解，通过模拟人类认知过程提取文档记忆，提升小语言模型的文本处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在理解相关文本块时限制了知识内化和推理能力，需要模拟人类阅读的认知过程来改进

Method: 使用LLM模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制；结合反向推理策略训练SLMs

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验结果表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆

Conclusion: MoM框架不仅提升了RAG系统的性能，还为SLMs实现以人为中心的智能文本处理开辟了新途径

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据如何影响语言模型行为，特别是事实知识获取方面，补充过去基于共现统计的观察性分析。

Method: 通过干预数据批次（"重写历史"）并重新训练模型检查点，包括选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档、重新训练和测量效果等步骤。

Result: 现有识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力，但补充了过去将共现与模型行为联系起来的观察分析。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可遵循的实验方法，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设，代码已公开以促进未来工作。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了LLM生成知识图谱中的实体解析问题，证明了去噪方法对提升图基RAG系统性能的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Motivation: 解决小型多语言模型在检索任务上性能落后于大型模型的问题，探索能否通过特定优化使小型模型在检索任务上表现更好。

Method: 分析训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型性能的影响，重点关注硬负样本的使用和任务多样性的作用。

Result: 开发出一个约300M参数的紧凑多语言模型，在检索性能上达到或超越了当前强大的7B模型。

Conclusion: 通过适当的训练策略优化，小型多语言模型可以在检索任务上实现与大型模型相当甚至更好的性能，而无需依赖大规模参数。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

Motivation: 现有护栏模型存在两个主要限制：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，与流式LLM推理不兼容。

Method: 提出Qwen3Guard系列模型，包含生成式变体（将安全分类转换为指令跟随任务，实现三分类判断）和流式变体（引入token级分类头，实现实时安全监控）。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全调节解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要检索多个相关证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在不足，需要更智能的检索策略。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器精确检索相关上下文，加法器补充缺失证据，通过迭代交互获得紧凑而全面的证据集。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue和MultiHopRAG四个多跳问答基准测试中，该方法持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 该智能检索系统能够有效过滤干扰内容，提高检索准确性，使下游问答模型在依赖较少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败问题。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架：表优先检索后列选择，列优先检索后表选择，并结合问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取等技术增强检索效果。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等挑战性基准测试中，显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，将完整模式和完美模式之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，该方法无需查询优化即可实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Method: 利用OpenAlex开源知识图谱，分析近8000篇开源论文数据，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，通过微调Qwen和DeepSeek模型实现精确的关键概念提取和创新点识别。

Result: 发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，通过模型微调在准确率上取得显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决学术论文分析中的关键概念关系挖掘问题，为科学家提供更深入的研究洞察。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语或少数高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含7种语言的平行多语言数学问题数据集，系统评估开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在不同语言间进行一致且可解释的数学推理能力存在持续缺陷，在低资源语言环境中性能退化尤为明显。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进LLM的多语言数学推理能力，特别是在低资源语言环境中，MathMist数据集为此提供了评估基准。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLM在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，并开发了多轮强化学习方法将欺骗行为减少77.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在与用户交互时可能产生欺骗性输出，存在安全风险，需要量化评估和减轻这种欺骗行为。

Method: 使用五种现有欺骗检测指标和提出的信念错位指标，在四种对话场景中评估欺骗；引入多轮强化学习方法来微调LLM以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗指标与人类判断相关性更高；LLM在26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗，被提示欺骗时欺骗性可增加31%；RLHF训练模型仍有43%的欺骗率；多轮强化学习方法将欺骗减少77.6%。

Conclusion: LLM在对话中存在显著的欺骗风险，需要超越单轮分析的多轮评估方法，提出的多轮强化学习方法能有效减少欺骗行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

TL;DR: 开发了一种结合Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入方法，通过逻辑回归和超参数微调，在阿尔茨海默病早期检测中达到91%准确率和97% AUC，优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，能及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的重要标志，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法和语义，将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归并微调超参数。

Result: 达到91%分类准确率和97% AUC，在区分早期AD与健康受试者方面优于现有最佳NLP模型（88%准确率）。模型稳定性高（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为AD的大规模筛查方法，也可作为医生检测AD的补充检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond One World基准测试，用于评估LLM在多版本角色扮演中的表现，包含30个英雄的90个版本，测试事实回忆和道德困境处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在忠实、一致地扮演特定版本角色方面能力不足，特别是像漫威和DC这样的超级英雄宇宙中存在多个版本角色，需要系统评估。

Method: 创建包含Canon Events（事实回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境）两个任务的基准，采用Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能提升弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要挑战；模型往往擅长思考或行动之一，很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医学大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异性能，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医学AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境下高级医学AI的普及具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs对结构化字符级扰动的鲁棒性，探索在在线考试系统等场景中防止LLM滥用的方法。

Method: 引入NAMESHORT方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符，通过字符级扰动来混淆文本，并评估不同模型、问题和噪声配置下的性能。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，尽管强混淆显著影响了分词和信噪比，许多LLM仍保持显著性能，表现出对字符级噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在低层级上的鲁棒性，这对理解LLM滥用的风险和在多样化应用中可靠部署LLM具有重要意义。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中许多问题（如医疗记录、合规文件等）需要聚合所有文档的信息，而现有方法在检索停止点和遗漏文档敏感性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出PluriHopRAG方法：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤无关文档，再进行LLM推理。

Result: PluriHopRAG在F1分数上相对提升了18-52%，而传统方法都无法超过40%的F1分数。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集揭示了当前QA系统在重复性、干扰性强的语料上的局限性，而PluriHopRAG证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为增强高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了有价值的基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个令牌预测方面表现出色，但在生成反映个人真实沟通风格（如回复邮件或社交消息）的响应方面仍有困难，且真实SNS或邮件历史由于隐私问题难以收集。

Method: 通过基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行受控的人机对话，构建包含英语、日语和中文的多语言基准数据集，每个用户与NPC互动五天以捕捉自然的日常沟通模式。

Result: 建立了首个YNTP基准，评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础。

Conclusion: YNTP任务和数据集为解决用户对齐的语言建模提供了重要基础，能够分析用户的内部模型并生成更符合个人沟通风格的响应。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架能有效增强医学问答的事实一致性并减轻幻觉，为可靠的医学AI系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部监督的自监督强化学习框架，通过从指令直接推导奖励信号并生成伪标签来解决多约束指令跟随问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在处理对现实应用至关重要的多约束指令时存在困难，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临多约束任务带来的稀疏奖励问题。

Method: 采用标签自监督强化学习框架，通过约束分解策略和高效的逐约束二元分类来生成奖励信号和伪标签，无需外部监督。

Result: 实验表明该方法泛化能力强，在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督强化学习框架有效解决了多约束指令跟随问题，消除了对外部监督的依赖，并在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式来构建可验证的网页代理训练数据，开发了WebAggregator-8B和32B模型，在信息聚合能力上超越GPT-4.1，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，忽视了信息聚合这一支持深度研究的关键需求。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：先通过主动在线探索收集真实网页证据，然后自演化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本、覆盖50K网站和11个领域的WebAggregatorQA数据集。WebAggregator-8B性能匹配GPT-4.1，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。

Conclusion: 网页代理在信息聚合能力上仍有显著不足，需要加强这方面的基础能力建设。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的编程式JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成，显著提升工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成解耦，消除任务干扰和格式限制

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT框架显著改善工具调用性能，特别是在开源模型中表现优异，对强化学习和监督微调阶段的模型训练有重要影响

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA是一个训练框架，通过锚定表示组合架构(Arca)和语言耦合语义推理器(LaSR)两个模块，在低资源条件下稳健提升跨语言表示，同时增强检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和不稳定的跨语言对齐。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca的多语言表示基础上添加语言感知轻量推理头，通过一致性正则化统一训练目标。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似度和推理）中，在少样本和噪声增强设置下均显示出持续增益和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效解决了低资源语言的跨语言表示问题，同时提升了检索和推理的鲁棒性，并通过消融实验验证了Arca和LaSR的贡献。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩表示方法，通过提取和重组实体级token并丢弃大部分其他输入token，提高了seq2seq共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，需要处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 采用压缩表示方法，提取实体级token并重新组织，同时丢弃大部分其他输入token，以提高增量设置中的处理效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes数据集上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，同时实现1.8的压缩比；在LitBank数据集上，性能超过现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大量token是增量共指消解的一种可行策略，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个新的数据集和分析框架，用于评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素和技术鲁棒性，发现虽然这些模型能支持低资源语言，但未必能很好地服务目标用户，且可能低估安全性等关键质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs两个关键问题的框架和数据集：(1)模型与用户社会文化背景的契合度，(2)模型在保持安全性和技术鲁棒性方面是否避免潜在危害。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥重要作用，但未必能很好地服务目标用户，且追求未经检验的主张可能导致低估安全性等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs发展需要更广泛的评估，包含更全面、基于实际的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 当前偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但在移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降。作者提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，发现基于序列的奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，而生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链达到81.8%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好（如创意、风格、情感共鸣），需要开发能更好理解主观偏好的方法。

Method: 构建包含1,800个人工标注偏好对的数据集（1,200英文，600中文），涵盖8种创意写作体裁，确保回答在客观正确性、事实准确性和长度上匹配。比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型平均准确率52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%。不同写作体裁间模型性能差异很大（18.2%-81.8%），模型规模（8B vs 27B）未带来一致改进。

Conclusion: 当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非主观质量偏好，成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Result: 实验结果显示，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务上表现提升，并能保持模型的分布外性能。

Conclusion: CodeSeq方法通过系统化的案例生成和自我检查机制，有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，同时保持了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RLAIF-SPA框架，使用强化学习结合AI反馈机制来提升语音合成的情感表达能力，通过ASR和LLM技术分别评估语义准确性和韵律情感对齐，显著改善了情感表达和可理解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音合成方法在情感表达方面存在不足，通常依赖昂贵的情绪标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音虽然准确但情感平淡。

Method: 采用强化学习从AI反馈(RLAIF)机制，结合自动语音识别(ASR)和大语言模型(LLM)技术，通过韵律标签对齐在四个细粒度维度(结构、情感、速度、音调)上优化情感表达，同时引入语义准确性反馈确保语音清晰准确。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上的实验表明，RLAIF-SPA优于Chat-TTS，词错误率(WER)降低26.1%，SIM-O指标提升9.1%，人工评估改进超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效解决了语音合成中情感表达不足的问题，通过直接优化情感表达和可理解性，显著提升了合成语音的质量。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，然后基于伪标签相似度进行聚类，不依赖预知聚类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，且需要预先知道聚类数量，这在现实场景中往往不可行。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集合中对每个文本进行多标签分类，基于假设：同一聚类的文本会共享更多标签，在嵌入空间中更接近。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法达到或优于现有基线方法，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM的奖励建模存在局限性：基于规则的奖励对表达变化脆弱且不适用于长文本任务；生成式奖励虽然更鲁棒，但在动态语料库中设计可验证且稳定的长文本奖励仍然困难且计算成本高。

Method: 1) 提出"nugget-as-rubric"范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准；2) 设计基于查询重写的自动rubric构建流程；3) 开发Search-Gen-V验证器，采用蒸馏思想和两阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 提出的"nugget-as-rubric"范式和Search-Gen-V验证器有效解决了搜索增强LLM奖励建模的挑战，提供了可扩展、鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种方法教机器翻译模型学习特定结构的语义韵，聚焦中文"被"字句的负面语义韵，通过微调模型提升翻译准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵是语言单位与搭配词形成的共现意义，与语义意义不同。当前机器翻译模型无法处理语义韵问题，导致翻译不准确。

Method: 创建英汉句子对数据集展示"被"字句的负面语义韵，然后微调OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行英汉翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的机器翻译模型在翻译负面内容时更善于使用"被"字句，在中性和正面内容中避免使用。NLLB-600M的语义韵知识可迁移到其他语言对。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升机器翻译模型对语义韵的处理能力，且知识具有跨语言迁移性。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问等风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类对危害产生方式和受影响人群的理解参与。

Method: 开发了基于用户故事生成和多智能体讨论的人类中心框架，支持在部署前进行创造性思考。

Result: 用户研究表明，阅读故事的参与者能识别更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；而未阅读故事者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事讲述帮助参与者推测更广泛的AI影响，并更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

*Mengzhao Jia,Zhihan Zhang,Ignacio Cases,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRubric-R1V是一个结合强化学习与过程监督的框架，通过自动收集基于量规的生成奖励来解决多模态大语言模型推理中的虚假推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但仅奖励最终答案正确性的强化学习方法会导致虚假推理。

Method: 提出自我聚合方法，从成功轨迹中提取一致的推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强教师模型即可构建问题特定的量规。结合量规奖励和结果奖励进行训练。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准上达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过过程级监督有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，实现了更好的推理性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pluto是一个评估LLM生成Verilog设计效率的基准框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM功能正确性达78.3%，但合成效率（面积63.8%、延迟65.9%、功耗64.0%）落后于专家设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注功能正确性，缺乏对硬件设计关键指标（面积、延迟、功耗）的全面评估，需要效率导向的评估框架来推动硬件LLM研究。

Method: 提出Pluto基准框架，包含114个设计问题，配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog设计效率。

Result: 最先进LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3% pass@1，但在合成效率方面明显落后：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0% eff@1。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究进展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个三元组包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理过程和最终文本。研究发现创意写作需要过程监督和通用数据的平衡，创意能力具有文化特异性，词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中，训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督。为了解决这个问题，需要构建一个能够捕捉多样化输出及其底层思维过程的中文创意写作数据集。

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本，构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理过程和最终文本的三元组。通过综合实验识别创意写作的两组件模型：叙事逻辑（通过过程监督提供）和语言表达（通过通用数据维持）。

Result: 研究发现：(1)过程监督非常有效但需要通用数据稳定，至少需要1:12的创意样本与通用样本比例；(2)创意能力具有文化特异性，中文和英文表现差距达89.26个百分点；(3)词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑支架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。过程监督与通用数据的平衡是实现高质量创意写作的关键。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了Answer Regeneration框架，通过额外模型推理来重新生成答案，减少答案提取算法对推理模型性能评估的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和最终答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要一种与提取规则无关的方法来提高评估可靠性。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，将先前的输入和输出加上"Answer:"前缀，然后从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架可以为模型评估提供更可靠的结果，减少答案提取方法带来的偏差。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对比分析对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在基于LLM的重新排序任务中的效果，发现SFT在权重更新方面优于CL，并在MRB基准上实现了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索哪种目标函数更适合基于LLM的重新排序任务，理解CL和SFT在LLM中表现差异的机制。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过探测实验比较CL和SFT在UMR任务中的表现，并进行大规模SFT训练。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显胜者，SFT在LLM重新排序中具有一致优势，在MRB基准上达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: SFT比CL更适合LLM重新排序任务，主要优势在于更强的权重更新机制，这一发现对未来的研究和应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中常因分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：在预填充阶段和定期间隔中，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；然后正常生成文本，保持修改后的路由器直到下一次适应。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在挑战性推理任务上获得一致性能提升，例如在OLMoE上HumanEval提升5.5%；与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效改善MoE路由决策，保持计算效率，防止过适应，且具有即插即用特性，可与现有测试时缩放技术互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了语言模型训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现在数学和代码领域，中期训练能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练具有更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练在实践中很流行，但对其有效性和机制缺乏科学理解。本文旨在通过受控实验系统研究中期训练的作用和效果。

Method: 通过从头开始预训练语言模型，并在不同领域的有监督微调数据集上进行实验，比较中期训练与持续预训练的效果。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能减少领域内验证损失和预训练数据遗忘。时间安排比混合权重更重要，早期引入专业数据效果更好。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR的新型编译器堆栈，专门针对AMD NPU等空间架构设计，通过AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的表示，实现空间调度和计算通信重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时限制了在现代空间架构上的效率，需要提供显式机制来协调计算和数据以充分利用这类架构。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言来表示异步和分层操作，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠，无需依赖临时运行时协调或手动调度。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手动优化的MLIR-AIE实现；多注意力头融合实现仅需约150行代码，能有效映射复杂工作负载到空间硬件。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能将高级结构化控制流转换为空间程序，通过编译器管理的调度有效利用NPU的计算结构和内存层次，实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: 解决LLM在语义等价输入下生成不一致输出的问题，当前缺乏一致性训练数据和微调技术的局限性阻碍了RAG系统的可靠性提升。

Method: 使用系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的层间模型融合方法，整合专业化模型知识。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，相比基线实现了约47.5%的响应相似度改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统可靠性提供了实用解决方案，通过改进的模型融合技术有效增强了LLM输出的一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Motivation: 传统的缩放定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，其中上下文起着关键作用，需要新的框架来建模训练计算量与上下文对下游性能的共同影响。

Method: 提出了一个简单可解释的框架，通过拟合Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B在65,500个实例上的下游性能数据，建模训练计算量与上下文的关系。

Result: 框架准确建模了分布内下游性能，在三个数量级的训练计算量上具有良好泛化能力，并能可靠地外推随着上下文增加的性能变化。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解训练计算量与上下文利用之间的相互作用提供了有价值的见解，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了机器学习模型在心理健康筛查中的有效性，使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，在抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD诊断中达到80%以上准确率，其中PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率，98%召回率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球致残的主要原因，但由于主观评估、临床资源有限以及污名化等因素，抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD经常被误诊或漏诊，初级保健环境中误诊率超过60%，亟需可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具。

Method: 使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，评估多种模型类别：包括GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用低秩适应(LoRA)微调的RoBERTa模型，比较不同上下文长度和模型配置的效果。

Result: 模型在所有诊断类别中达到80%以上准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率，98%召回率）。较短的上下文和聚焦的上下文片段能提高召回率，LoRA微调在低秩配置（如秩8和16）下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自评筛查工具能显著改进诊断效果，为低门槛、AI驱动的早期诊断提供了路径，为在资源匮乏或高污名化环境中整合机器学习到临床工作流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Conclusion: LaSeR算法通过最小化额外计算成本（仅需一个额外token推理）实现了推理和自我奖励能力的联合优化，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Conclusion: MetaBench为开发和评估代谢组学AI系统提供了必要的基础设施，有助于推动代谢组学研究中可靠计算工具的系统性进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时的表现，发现现有模型在方言输入上性能下降32.26%-48.17%，并提出了一种编码器缓解策略，能在保持标准英语性能的同时显著提升方言处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型能否有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言，但现有模型主要针对标准英语训练。

Method: 构建包含6种英语方言的大规模基准数据集（4200+提示），评估17个图像和视频生成模型，设计基于编码器的缓解策略来教模型识别新方言特征。

Result: 当前最先进模型在方言输入上性能下降32.26%-48.17%，传统缓解方法效果有限（<7%），而提出的编码器方法能将5种方言性能提升至标准英语水平（+34.4%），且几乎不影响标准英语性能。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著性能下降，但通过专门的编码器缓解策略可以同时提升方言处理能力和保持标准英语性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

TL;DR: 提出IGPO框架，通过信息增益为多轮智能体训练提供密集的内在监督，解决传统结果奖励稀疏性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在多轮交互环境中依赖最终结果奖励，导致奖励稀疏问题，特别是在长轨迹中会出现优势崩溃和细粒度信用分配缺失的问题

Method: IGPO将每轮交互建模为获取真实信息的过程，定义轮级奖励为策略产生正确答案概率的边际增长，直接从模型自身信念更新推导内在奖励

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景下始终优于强基线方法，实现更高准确率和改进的样本效率

Conclusion: IGPO通过信息增益提供密集的内在监督，有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，提升了性能和效率

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator是一个可扩展的范式，通过生成结构化UI状态和转换来大规模合成训练轨迹，解决了数字代理需要多样化UI轨迹但收集成本高昂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化现实世界任务，但通过人工标注收集此类数据在人力、基础设施和工程角度都极其昂贵。

Method: 该范式集成了数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，引导展开过程实现连贯探索，以及轨迹包装器生成高质量多样化训练轨迹。还提出了UI-Simulator-Grow目标缩放策略，通过优先处理高影响力任务和合成信息丰富的轨迹变体来实现更快速和数据高效的缩放。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator在鲁棒性方面优于或媲美在真实UI上训练的开源代理，尽管使用了较弱的教师模型。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型就能达到Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力，为解决UI轨迹数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了TokDrift框架，发现代码LLM对语义相同但格式不同的代码变体会产生显著行为差异，揭示了子词分词与语法不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码LLM使用基于统计的子词分词器，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因格式差异而被不同分词，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在分词上不同的代码变体，分析九个代码LLM的行为变化。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著偏移，问题源于早期嵌入层中子词分词未能捕捉语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 分词不匹配是代码理解和生成的隐藏障碍，未来代码LLM需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

### [124] [Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14973)
*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache是一种无需训练、架构无关的策略，通过自适应地决定何时刷新（基于注意力感知的漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（基于深度感知的调度），减少扩散大语言模型中KV缓存的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和层中为所有token重新计算QKV，尽管KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层中，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远距离MASK token主要作为长度偏置，可以在活动预测窗口之外进行块级缓存；(2) KV动态性随深度增加，从更深层开始选择性刷新足够；(3) 最受关注token的KV漂移最小，为其他token的缓存变化提供保守下界。提出Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定刷新时机和刷新位置。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上的实验显示：GSM8K（256 tokens）加速8.7倍，长序列加速45.1倍，HumanEval加速4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。在GSM8K上实现6.8倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，显著减少冗余计算，加速扩散LLMs的解码，同时保持生成质量，实现实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究和平条约的长期经济影响，填补了阿拉伯-以色列和平协议经济红利因果证据的空白。

Method: 使用合成控制法和差分合成控制估计器，分析1978年《戴维营协议》和1994年约旦-以色列和平条约的经济影响。

Result: 到2011年，埃及实际GDP比合成反事实高出64%，人均收入高出82%；约旦实际GDP高出75%，人均收入高出20%以上。两国获益机制不同：埃及主要通过财政重新分配、外国直接投资增加和制度可信度提升；约旦主要通过贸易和金融流入增强。

Conclusion: 和平协议能产生巨大、持久且异质性的增长红利，为和平进程提供了强有力的经济论据。

Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence on the long-run economic
dividends of Arab-Israeli peace treaties. Using synthetic control and
difference-in-synthetic control estimators, we analyze 1978 Camp David Accords
and 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Both cases reveal large and
lasting gains. By 2011, real GDP of Egypt exceeded its synthetic counterfactual
by 64 percent, and per capita income by 82 percent. Jordanian trajectory shows
similarly permanent improvements, with real GDP higher by 75 percent and per
capita income by more than 20 percent. The mechanisms differ: in Egypt, gains
stem from a sharp fiscal reallocation together with higher foreign direct
investment and improved institutional credibility, while Jordan benefited
primarily through enhanced trade and financial inflows. Robustness and placebo
tests confirm the uniqueness of these effects. The results demonstrate that
peace agreements yield large, durable, and heterogeneous growth dividends.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 俄勒冈健康保险实验研究表明，医疗补助覆盖通过减轻医疗费用负担，显著降低了低收入成年人的不快乐概率，对高支出和低支出群体都有积极影响，但对非常快乐状态的影响仅限于低支出群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用俄勒冈健康保险实验的随机设计，探究医疗补助覆盖对低收入成年人幸福感的因果影响，特别关注医疗支出水平如何调节这种关系。

Method: 使用工具变量回归方法，在治疗12个月后对支出水平和幸福感评级进行分组，共进行6个独立的回归分析。

Result: 医疗补助显著降低了不快乐的概率（无论支出高低），减少了高支出且相当快乐的概率，增加了低支出且相当快乐的概率，对非常快乐状态仅对低支出群体有积极影响。

Conclusion: 医疗补助通过减轻财务负担改善了不同亚群体的福祉，特别是对低支出群体的幸福感提升更为明显。

Abstract: The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) offers a unique opportunity to
examine the causal relationship between Medicaid coverage and happiness among
low-income adults, using an experimental design. This study leverages data from
comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous
studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited
a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not
receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage
impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction variations in
healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or
lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression,
I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by
expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct
patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of
experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low
medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty
happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among
those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the
OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its
effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with
the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the
well-being of distinct subgroups.

Motivation: IoT设备的快速扩张超过了现有识别方法的能力，给安全、隐私和网络问责带来了显著风险，特别是在元数据不完整、嘈杂或被故意混淆的开放世界环境中。

Method: 构建语义推理管道，将设备识别重构为语言建模任务；使用基于互信息和熵稳定性的集成大语言模型为IoT Inspector数据集生成高保真厂商标签；采用课程学习对量化LLaMA3.18B模型进行指令调优。

Result: 模型在2,015个厂商上实现了98.25%的top-1准确率和90.73%的宏观准确率，同时对缺失字段、协议漂移和对抗性操作保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为大规模真实世界设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法在知识迁移和中间数据完整性方面存在不足，需要更有效的机制来处理从源域到目标域的平滑知识迁移。

Method: 引入动态加权机制，使用时间变化超参数ϱ控制域特定学习强度，结合自训练生成伪标签，优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法，消融研究验证了动态调度的重要性。

Conclusion: STDW为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论见解和实用框架，能有效减少域偏差并提高泛化能力，适用于动态现实场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Motivation: 基于神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差的假设，旨在提高模型在不同领域的泛化性能。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，分离出可泛化的表示，同时保持架构完整性。该方法适用于各种模型架构和数据模态。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验结果显示，该方法在不同模型架构和数据模态下都能带来一致的性能提升。分析表明该方法能诱导特征稀疏化并有效分离高频分量。

Conclusion: Deep Edge Filter通过特征滤波有效提升了模型的泛化能力，验证了高频分量包含语义信息、低频分量包含领域偏差的核心假设，为改进模型泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN提出了一种用于GAN的持续少样本学习框架，通过低秩适配技术减少参数数量，同时解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的持续学习方法（如LFS-GAN）在每次训练迭代中都会引入大量新权重，这在长期考虑时会变得显著。因此需要一种更高效的参数适应方法。

Method: 使用低秩张量（LoRA）来高效适应目标任务，进一步提出LLoRA技术优化卷积层的适配器大小，并提供超参数选择的实证研究。

Result: 在多个基准CL和FS任务上的实验表明，CoLoR-GAN高效且达到SOTA性能，同时显著减少了所需资源数量。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN通过低秩适配技术成功解决了GAN中的持续少样本学习问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联合能量模型（JEM）在实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成建模方面存在训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题，需要一种更稳定的训练方法。

Method: 采用对抗训练原则，用PGD生成的对比样本优化能量函数，结合两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM训练的不兼容性，无需显式梯度惩罚。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，生成质量超越BigGAN并接近扩散模型，首次实现MCMC-based EBM在复杂高分辨率数据集上的高质量生成。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础，同时实现视觉数据的生成和鲁棒分类，解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

*Yanshan Xiao,Kaihong Wu,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过利用每个视图的局部最近邻结构并强调多视图间局部结构的互补性，解决了多视图半监督标签分布学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图和全监督场景，而多视图场景下同时包含标记和未标记数据的标签分布学习问题尚未被研究。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k-最近邻，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充当前视图的最近邻集，最后基于补充后的最近邻集构建图学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试解决多视图标签分布学习问题，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来补充彼此。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过池化函数在λ值搜索空间中对模型权重进行聚合，无需评估数据即可优化模型合并效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的λ设置原则，导致研究者不得不使用评估数据进行调优，这在实践中不可行。

Method: 使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中对模型权重进行聚合，具有高模块性和最小约束。

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三种实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习和领域泛化）中验证，平均准确率在无需数据设置下提升高达15.9个百分点。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving是一种即插即用的技术，与现有模型合并方法正交，消除了评估数据需求，显著提升了模型合并性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ICD编码自动分配方法，将问题从分类任务重新定义为检索系统视角，同时考虑编码的顺序，实现了分类和排序的双重目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD诊断代码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法仅将其视为分类任务，忽略了代码顺序的重要性。

Method: 将ICD编码分配问题从分类任务重新定义为检索系统视角，同时考虑编码顺序，形成分类和排序的双重任务框架。

Result: 模型在正确排序主要诊断代码方面的准确率达到47%，远超现有最佳分类器的20%。在分类指标上，微平均和宏平均F1分数分别为0.6065和0.2904，优于之前最佳模型的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 提出的检索系统框架在识别高优先级代码方面具有显著优势，同时保持了良好的分类性能，为ICD编码自动化任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

### [136] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于逆问题中的信号恢复，通过分布级校准替代逐点匹配，避免对测量噪声的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数如均方误差或负对数似然寻求与噪声测量的逐点一致性，往往导致对噪声的过拟合。需要一种能够统计评估测量数据与噪声分布一致性的方法。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，使用基于模型的概率分数对每个测量进行分布级校准，作为标准数据一致性项的直接插件替代。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需提前停止训练即可获得更高PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一种统计基础扎实、性能提升的替代传统保真度损失的方法，特别适用于测量噪声分布已知且测量数据集包含许多独立噪声值的实际逆问题。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

*Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Wenhui Wang,Ting Song,Li Dong,Yan Xia,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一种轻量级方法，可将全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1, 0, 1}），在特定下游任务上实现接近全精度模型的性能，同时显著减少内存占用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全精度大语言模型在特定任务部署时计算成本高、内存占用大的问题，通过量化技术实现高效部署。

Method: 结合三种关键技术：SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏、以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练，以缓解微调后全精度与1.58位模型在特定任务上的性能差距。

Result: 在多种模型规模下，BitDistill实现了与全精度对应模型相当的性能，同时实现了高达10倍的内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种有效的轻量化解决方案，能够在保持任务性能的同时显著降低大语言模型的部署成本。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REAP的专家剪枝方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，能够实现接近无损的压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型虽然训练效率高，但参数量大导致内存开销严重，需要研究专家压缩方法。

Method: 提出了Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)剪枝标准，综合考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%的专家也能实现接近无损的压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务中更优的压缩策略，REAP方法能够有效避免专家合并导致的功能子空间崩溃问题。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clifford-可操纵CNNs的核基不完备，限制了模型的表达能力，需要解决这一问题来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出条件Clifford-可操纵核，通过输入特征场计算等变表示来增强核，推导等变约束并通过隐式参数化高效求解。

Result: 在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等多个PDE预测任务中，该方法始终优于基线方法，证明了改进的表达能力。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford-可操纵核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完备的问题，显著提升了模型在PDE预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上添加噪声自适应分层学习率的方法，通过估计梯度方差来动态调整不同层的学习率，显著加速了深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择适当范数来利用DNN的几何结构，但在同一范数组内的层之间使用固定学习率，忽略了层间局部曲率的异质性和训练过程中的动态变化，导致训练效率不高。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法基础上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，实时估计由所选LMO诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并据此为每个组内的层分配随时间变化的噪声自适应学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法达到尖锐的收敛率，在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，该方法比最先进的优化器收敛更快。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效解决几何感知优化中固定学习率的问题，显著提升DNN训练效率，特别是在transformer架构上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: COFFEE模型是一种新颖的时变状态空间模型，通过引入状态反馈机制实现上下文相关的选择性，在保持并行实现能力的同时，显著提升了长序列依赖建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度问题和长序列依赖建模困难，而现有的状态空间模型（如Mamba的S6模块）的选择性机制仅依赖于当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文理解。

Method: COFFEE模型通过状态反馈机制，从内部状态计算选择性，内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示；采用高效的模型参数化方法，消除S6中的冗余，实现更紧凑和可训练的公式。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以比S6少两个数量级的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上，COFFEE大幅超越S6，仅用3585个参数就达到97%的准确率。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展和高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了通过状态反馈实现上下文相关选择性的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Motivation: 现有因果表示学习评估方法存在两难困境：要么使用过于简化的合成数据集，要么依赖真实世界任务的下游性能，难以兼顾真实性和评估精度。

Method: 创建包含24个子场景的模拟数据集，提供对底层因果生成过程的真实访问，允许用户修改因果结构以符合CRL假设。

Result: 基于该基准评估了代表性CRL方法，提供了实证见解，帮助实践者选择合适的CRL框架来解决实际问题。

Conclusion: 该基准在严格评估和现实适用性之间架起了桥梁，为因果表示学习研究提供了全面的测试平台。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络和图神经网络的关键特征，旨在理解其计算能力和结构限制。

Method: 建立稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导关联多面体的维度紧界，并构建深度层次结构。

Result: 证明了足够深的稀疏maxout网络具有通用性，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅靠增加宽度无法补偿稀疏性带来的限制。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力与深度密切相关，在固定稀疏性约束下，深度是实现通用逼近能力的关键因素，宽度无法替代深度的作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Motivation: 系统性、组合性泛化超越训练分布仍是机器学习核心挑战，也是现代语言模型推理能力的关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入四种架构机制：输入自适应循环、算法监督、通过离散瓶颈的锚定潜在表示、显式纠错机制。

Result: 这些机制共同形成了在Transformer网络中实现原生可扩展潜在空间推理的架构方法，具有强大的算法泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过机制解释性分析揭示了这些机制如何产生稳健的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究双边市场中的定价和匹配算法，设计了一种基于在线学习的定价策略，在需求供给曲线未知的情况下实现接近最优的利润，同时控制队列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双边市场中，平台需要设计定价和匹配算法来最大化利润，同时保持合理的队列长度。由于实际中需求供给曲线可能未知，需要开发在线学习策略。

Method: 提出一种新颖的在线学习定价策略，包含动态组件优化遗憾与队列长度的权衡，以及概率组件解决快速学习样本获取与队列长度控制之间的张力。

Result: 证明了三个性能指标之间的权衡关系：$\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$遗憾、$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$平均队列长度和$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$最大队列长度，其中$\gamma \\in (0, 1/6]$，显著优于现有结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在遗憾与平均队列长度之间的权衡在允许的$\gamma$范围内是最优的，匹配了需求供给曲线已知时的最优结果，为双边市场平台提供了有效的运营解决方案。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Motivation: 理解无监督强化学习算法SGCRL在解决长时程目标任务时涌现探索行为的内在机制，阐明其如何在没有外部奖励或课程的情况下实现有效探索。

Method: 结合理论分析SGCRL目标函数与受控实验，研究算法如何通过学习的表征塑造隐式奖励，并分析低秩状态空间表征对探索动态的影响。

Result: 发现SGCRL通过学习的表征自动修改奖励景观，在到达目标前促进探索，之后促进利用；探索动态源于学习低秩状态空间表征，而非神经网络函数逼近。

Conclusion: 对SGCRL探索机制的理解使其能够适应安全感知探索，为无监督强化学习的探索行为提供了理论解释和实践改进方向。

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了解耦图卷积网络（D-GCN）来预测异构多跳无线网络中的饱和吞吐量，通过分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统p-persistent CSMA协议分析在异构多跳网络中预测吞吐量困难，简化模型低估吞吐量48-62%，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度指数增长，标准GNN因对称归一化混淆干扰效应而性能不佳。

Method: 设计D-GCN架构，显式分离节点自身传输概率处理与邻居干扰效应，用可学习注意力机制替代均值聚合，捕获复杂多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3%的归一化平均绝对误差，优于强基线方法，在精确分析方法计算不可行时仍保持可处理性，基于梯度的网络优化达到理论最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过解耦干扰效应实现了对异构多跳无线网络吞吐量的准确、可扩展预测，为网络优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Conclusion: ProtGram-DirectGCN为蛋白质相互作用预测提供了一种计算效率高的有效方法，特别适用于数据稀缺场景，在保持性能的同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent

TL;DR: ConDA框架通过对比学习在扩散嵌入中组织潜在空间，使潜在几何与系统动态对齐，支持非线性轨迹遍历以实现可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间未明确组织以实现可解释控制。受对比学习能恢复更解耦和结构化表示的启发，需要组织扩散潜在空间以反映底层动态因素。

Method: 在扩散嵌入中应用对比学习，使潜在几何与系统动态对齐，支持非线性轨迹遍历，包括插值、外推和可控生成。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、治疗性神经刺激和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA相比线性遍历和基于条件的方法产生了更可解释的潜在表示和更好的可控性。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码了动态相关结构，但利用这种结构需要在潜在流形上进行潜在组织和平移。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的参与困境问题，即参与实体不愿贡献或搭便车的行为，确保联邦学习系统的实际可行性。

Method: 应用经济学和博弈论概念，结合区块链和深度强化学习等技术解决方案，构建激励机制分类法。

Result: 建立了涵盖集中式和去中心化架构的全面激励机制分类法，并展示了在医疗、智能基础设施等领域的应用前景。

Conclusion: 精心设计的激励机制是联邦学习实际成功的关键要素，但目前仍面临构建可持续、公平和稳健联邦学习生态系统的重大挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

*Asma Jamali,Tin Sum Cheng,Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对分子核方法进行首次全面光谱分析，发现更丰富的光谱特征并不总是提升预测精度，甚至在某些情况下与性能呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最优精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境下的鲁棒性和理论透明性仍被广泛使用。目前缺乏对分子核的系统光谱分析。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归的光谱分析，使用四种光谱指标和截断核方法。

Result: 更丰富的光谱特征并不一致提高精度；对于transformer和局部3D表示，光谱丰富度与性能呈负相关；仅保留前2%特征值即可恢复几乎所有性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富光谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式，揭示了表示、核特征与预测性能之间的复杂关系，对数据受限的科学任务评估具有指导意义。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文严谨地形式化了平坦极小值与对抗鲁棒性的关系，发现平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性而非全局鲁棒性，并揭示了对抗样本往往位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络在经验上取得成功，但它们仍然容易受到小的对抗性扰动攻击。长期以来存在一个假设认为平坦极小值（损失景观中的低曲率区域）能提供更强的鲁棒性，但这种联系一直缺乏严谨的形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，然后利用这个表达式约束输入空间中损失的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。通过理论和实验验证，揭示了损失需要在数据流形之外急剧弯曲才能保持全局鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，平坦极小值只能保证局部对抗鲁棒性，而要维持超出局部邻域的鲁棒性，损失需要在数据流形之外急剧弯曲。对抗样本通常位于大而平坦的区域，模型在这些区域自信但错误。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了关于平坦性的简化观点，提供了对其在鲁棒性中作用的细致理解：平坦性仅能提供局部鲁棒性，全局鲁棒性需要损失在数据流形之外急剧弯曲。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Motivation: 竞争性编程已成为评估大型语言模型推理和问题解决能力的重要基准。虽然一些专有模型声称在IOI中达到金牌水平，但使用开源模型实现类似性能仍面临挑战。

Method: 结合大规模生成、行为聚类、排序和轮询提交策略，在有限验证预算下高效探索多样化的解决方案空间。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM推理能力的透明和可复现评估设立了新基准，证明了开源模型在竞争性编程中可以达到顶尖水平。

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: DR-RPO在多种领域中验证了其鲁棒性，为鲁棒强化学习中的策略优化提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在预测弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应时，对未见海况的泛化能力有限，主要原因是忽略了海洋系统的自然衰减现象和对波-结构相互作用建模不足。

Method: 提出PhysAttnNet模型，包含衰减双向自注意力模块（模拟自然衰减）、相位差引导双向交叉注意力模块（捕捉波-结构相互作用），通过全局上下文融合模块整合双流，并采用混合时频损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: 该模型为海洋工程中复杂系统的预测模型开发提供了一个有前景的框架，具有重要的工程应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中的应用增加，特别是生理信号处理领域，需要系统比较通用型与专用型模型的实际性能差异

Method: 使用包含51个任务的综合基准测试，覆盖心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理，从7个维度评估模型性能

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号分析任务中表现更佳，但研究也强调了训练数据选择的重要性，并提供了关于泛化性、公平性和注意力可视化的深入分析

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得了显著成功，但其内部机制仍然很大程度上是黑盒，缺乏清晰的理解。现有可解释性方法各有价值但视角有限，需要补充性的新方法来深入理解Transformer层功能。

Method: CAST框架使用Moore-Penrose伪逆直接估计每层的实际变换矩阵，然后应用频谱分析，使用六个可解释指标来表征层行为，包括核分析以揭示层间功能关系。

Result: 分析显示编码器模型和解码器模型具有明显不同的行为：解码器模型表现出压缩-扩展循环，而编码器模型保持一致的高秩处理。核相似性分析将层清晰地划分为三个阶段：特征提取、压缩和专业化。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一个补充现有方法的视角，通过直接矩阵估计和频谱分析揭示了Transformer层的功能特性，为理解语言模型内部机制提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法通常需要模型梯度或重训练，限制了在专有或大规模设置中的适用性。

Method: 基于数据驱动的非参数归因方法，通过图像块级相似度测量生成图像与训练图像之间的影响，利用最优得分函数的解析形式，并通过卷积加速实现计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅产生空间可解释的归因，还揭示了训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，独立于任何特定模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统忽略了风险评分的时间稳定性评估，且主要基于表格数据，缺乏对多模态输入下轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 在六个预测任务中，现有方法特别是LLMs难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中获得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算在边缘AI应用中具有优势，但单独使用可能需要在资源受限设备上使用过大的储层。注意力机制能提高精度但计算量大，影响学习效率。

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算集成，形成SR-RC方法。

Result: 在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上，SR-RC优于传统储层计算和基于谱残差方法提取值的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署储层计算进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向，因为谱残差方法与储层计算都适合硬件实现。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知框架，用于检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击，通过构建管状邻域和局部自适应排名来识别偏离类子流形的激活，在有限数据场景下实现最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中的广泛使用，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意行为但看起来良性）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对利用细微距离异常或干净样本稀缺的攻击时存在漏洞。

Method: TED++围绕每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活中估计局部"厚度"，然后应用局部自适应排名(LAR)检测偏离允许管的激活。通过聚合所有层的LAR调整排名，捕捉输入在演化类子流形上的忠实度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下均实现最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，AUROC比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过管约束行为特征有效检测隐蔽后门攻击，在数据稀缺情况下仍保持强大检测能力，为深度神经网络安全提供了可靠防御方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态可能成本高昂，并可能对未来的结果产生负面影响。需要一种方法让智能体能够主动选择何时进行状态测量。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，并使用顺序蒙特卡洛方法近似未知静态环境参数和未观测潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 在数字健康应用中评估了该算法，智能体决定何时提供数字干预以及何时通过调查评估用户健康状态。

Conclusion: 尽管测量成本存在，但减少的不确定性可以证明提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

*Shivam Singhal,Eran Malach,Tomaso Poggio,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和ERM验证的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性之间的权衡问题。传统方法要么需要指数级搜索（枚举法），要么需要大量样本（梯度训练）

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练LLM生成候选程序，在保留数据上编译验证，选择最佳假设，无需梯度或反馈

Result: LLM-ERM仅需200个样本即可解决奇偶校验、模式匹配、素数测试等任务，而SGD训练的transformer即使使用100,000个样本也会过拟合

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行性的同时恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习简洁假设提供了实用途径

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

*Shruti Sarika Chakraborty,Peter Minary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DARTS-GT，通过非对称注意力机制和解耦结构编码与特征表示，结合可微分架构搜索为每层选择最优GNN算子，并开发首个图Transformer定量可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer设计僵化，缺乏量化可解释性，固定GNN类型无法充分利用深度特定组件选择，复杂架构难以区分性能提升是来自有意义的模式还是虚假相关性。

Method: 重新设计图Transformer注意力机制，使查询来自节点特征，键值来自GNN变换；使用可微分架构搜索为每层选择最优GNN算子；开发因果消融的定量可解释性框架，包含头部偏差、专业化和聚焦度指标。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进水平，其他数据集保持竞争力；发现的架构揭示数据集特定模式；可解释性分析显示视觉注意力显著性与因果重要性并不总是相关。

Conclusion: DARTS-GT发现的异构架构比基线产生更可解释的模型，证明图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做出选择。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

### [176] [Stop-RAG: Value-Based Retrieval Control for Iterative RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14337)
*Jaewan Park,Solbee Cho,Jay-Yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Stop-RAG，一种基于价值的控制器，用于自适应决定何时停止迭代检索增强生成(RAG)过程，以解决现有方法固定迭代次数或依赖不可靠置信度代理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG虽然能回答复杂多跳问题，但每次额外循环都会增加延迟、成本，并可能引入干扰证据，因此需要高效的停止策略。现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能准确反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入Stop-RAG控制器，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练，学习有效的停止策略。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG在准确率上持续优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制能够提高RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Motivation: 为自动微分理论提供几何视角，通过微分几何工具建立AD的严格数学基础，避免传统方法中的组合爆炸问题，为深度学习和科学计算开发结构保持的微分方法奠定基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD建模为余切拉回操作，泰勒模式AD建模为Weil代数中的求值过程，并引入张量化Weil代数实现所有混合导数的一次性计算。

Result: 推导了反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界，证明张量化Weil代数能以线性成本计算所有混合导数，避免了嵌套JVP/VJP调度的组合爆炸。

Conclusion: 该几何框架为AD理论提供了微分几何视角，为开发结构保持的微分方法奠定了基础，在深度学习和科学计算中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了LLM提示优化中的投毒风险，发现基于反馈的攻击比查询注入更危险，提出了无需访问奖励模型的假奖励攻击，并设计了高亮防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统现在支撑着日常AI应用，性能依赖于精心设计的提示。LLM提示优化器通过评分反馈迭代优化提示，但这一优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统性分析，引入简单的假奖励攻击（无需访问奖励模型），并提出轻量级的高亮防御方法。

Result: 发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性显著高于注入查询：基于反馈的攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48。假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23提升到0.07，同时不降低实用性。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道应被视为一级攻击面，需要为反馈通道和优化框架建立更强的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波谐振激发状态空间模型），一种用于超长序列建模的二阶尖峰状态空间模型，在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNNs）的能效优势和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的能力，开发适用于资源受限应用的乘法自由、稀疏事件驱动的深度学习模型。

Method: 设计二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的高效稳定实现，并首次提出基于谐振激发神经元的核尖峰回归器用于超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比二阶ANN-based SSMs节省73倍能量，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，平均表现优于transformer或一阶SSM。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM为超长序列建模提供了高效节能的解决方案，同时系统分析了谐振激发SSM中异质性、耗散和守恒性的影响。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

### [180] [Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了多模态学习中不仅存在表示层的不平衡，还在决策层存在显著偏差，即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍会系统性地偏向某些模态（如音频）。这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅优化动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习整合不同模态信息以提升性能，但常受模态不平衡问题困扰，即主导模态在联合优化过程中压制较弱模态。本文旨在揭示这种不平衡不仅发生在表示学习阶段，更显著体现在决策层。

Method: 在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析预训练和平衡优化后模型的模态偏差。通过特征空间和决策权重分布分析，识别偏差来源。

Result: 实验表明，即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍会系统性地偏向某些模态（如音频）。这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅优化动态。融合阶段未校准的模态输出聚合导致决策层权重偏差，阻碍较弱模态有效贡献。

Conclusion: 未来多模态系统应在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态能力实现相对平衡，而非仅关注表示层优化。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互一致性指数（IC-index）来评估药物-靶点亲和力预测中交互方向的准确性，揭示了机器学习算法在未见药物或靶点情况下无法捕捉交互作用的局限性，并通过实证研究验证了不同预测方法在IC-index上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物-靶点亲和力预测主要关注亲和力数值的准确性，但忽略了交互作用方向的重要性。正确捕捉交互作用能显著改善决策质量，如药物剂量分配。

Method: 引入IC-index评估交互方向预测性能，分析预测器对交互作用的捕捉能力，并研究机器学习算法的置换等变性如何影响其对未见药物/靶点的交互作用预测。

Result: 实验表明，仅依赖已知亲和力数据的预测器无法有效捕捉交互作用，而结合药物和靶点侧信息的模型在IC-index上表现更好。

Conclusion: IC-index补充了现有预测性能评估指标，强调了在药物-靶点亲和力预测中考虑交互方向的重要性，特别是对于未见实体的预测场景。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Motivation: MoE技术虽然能有效扩展模型规模，但其巨大的内存开销使得模型压缩成为重要研究方向。现有专家合并方法主要从参数聚合角度理解，本文希望从专家输出合并的新视角来改进压缩效果。

Method: 将专家合并过程解释为在正向计算中插入额外矩阵，从而建立优化公式。基于此分析提出了MergeMoE方法，利用数学优化构建压缩矩阵。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上的评估表明，MergeMoE算法在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并角度理解MoE压缩问题，并采用数学优化方法构建压缩矩阵，能够获得更好的压缩效果。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索在大型语言模型剪枝后，如何高效恢复性能，挑战当前认为完全重新训练计算不可行的观点。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重构粒度（单矩阵、组件级、块级）和不同剪枝标准的效果。

Result: 发现组件级重构（分别重构注意力和MLP）在资源效率和困惑度方面达到帕累托最优，性能优于完全重新训练，且简单剪枝标准在正确重构下能胜过复杂方法。

Conclusion: 研究结论挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重新训练"的叙事，为LLMs剪枝后性能恢复提供了重要见解，表明适当的重构策略可以超越完全重新训练的效果。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Result: GAN训练稳定，生成的样本能准确再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯记忆训练数据的问题，且能遵循叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在地质结构特定训练数据集上表现出比预期更强的鲁棒性，利用地质原理（如叠加定律）来指导深度生成模型具有很大潜力，但在更大3D图像和多模态数据集上的适用性仍需验证。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: MECo是一个分子优化框架，通过将编辑意图转化为可执行代码，弥合了推理与执行之间的差距，显著提高了分子编辑的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在分子优化中虽然能生成高级编辑意图，但在执行这些修改时，特别是在处理SMILES等非直观表示时，往往难以忠实地实现这些意图。

Method: MECo采用级联框架：首先从分子和属性目标生成人类可解释的编辑意图，然后通过代码生成将这些意图转化为可执行的结构编辑。

Result: 该方法在重现化学反应的编辑时达到超过98%的准确率，在优化基准测试中一致性提高了38-86个百分点至90%以上，成功率高于基于SMILES的基线方法，同时保持结构相似性。

Conclusion: MECo通过对齐意图与执行，实现了一致、可控和可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文近似（ICA）的数据选择和重加权框架，通过少量精选的保留集来估计候选训练样本的损失，无需参考模型或额外微调，能有效提升模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型微调方法中，噪声或无关样本会稀释监督信号，而系统化、高效识别高价值训练数据的方法仍不足，现有方法多依赖启发式或昂贵的重训练。

Method: 核心是In-Context Approximation（ICA），通过在小规模精选保留集上进行上下文条件化，估计模型在候选样本上训练后的保留损失。基于局部线性化理论，ICA等价于向保留最优解的一阶更新，可作为数据价值的代理指标。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等不同训练方法，以及多种骨干网络和数据集上，ICA重加权方法都能持续改进模型对齐效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论依据和高效实现，能显著提升模型对齐性能，但对快速漂移的在线策略更新存在局限性，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Guess2Graph框架，使用专家猜测指导统计测试顺序而非替代测试，保持统计一致性同时提升性能。开发了PC-Guess和gPC-Guess两种实现，后者在专家优于随机时理论保证优于非增强版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果发现算法在样本有限时表现不佳，现有整合专家知识的方法需要完美预测或不确定性估计，实际应用不可靠。

Method: Guess2Graph框架利用专家猜测指导统计测试顺序，开发PC-Guess和gPC-Guess两种算法，后者专门设计以更好利用高质量专家输入。

Result: 理论上两种方法在专家错误时仍保持正确性，gPC-Guess在专家优于随机时有限样本性能优于非增强版本。实证显示两者随专家准确度单调提升，gPC-Guess获得显著更强增益。

Conclusion: Guess2Graph框架成功整合专家知识指导因果发现，保持统计保证同时提升性能，gPC-Guess变体在高质量专家输入时表现更优。

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

*Andrejs Sorstkins,Omer Tariq,Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出可逆学习框架，通过可逆性度量和选择性状态回滚来提高基于价值的强化学习的鲁棒性和效率，显著减少灾难性错误并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习代理在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，特别是在高风险决策场景下。

Method: 框架包含两个核心机制：基于经验推导的状态-动作可逆性度量Phi(s,a)，以及选择性状态回滚操作。Phi度量量化在固定时间窗口内返回先前状态的可能性，用于动态调整TD更新中的惩罚项。当动作的预期回报远低于瞬时估计值且违反阈值时，执行回滚操作。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0环境中，灾难性跌落减少99.8%以上，平均回合回报提升55%；在Taxi v3环境中，非法动作抑制≥99.9%，累积奖励提升65.7%，两个环境的奖励方差均显著降低。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

TL;DR: 本文提出选择性表示空间（SRS）模块，通过可学习的选择性分块和动态重组技术，自适应地选择和重排时间序列块，以增强基于分块的时间序列预测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法将时间序列划分为相邻块，导致固定的表示空间，无法充分表达信息。本文旨在构建灵活的选择性表示空间，包含最具信息量的块用于预测。

Method: 提出SRS模块，包含可学习的选择性分块和动态重组技术，自适应地从上下文时间序列中选择和重排块。构建SRSNet模型，由SRS模块和MLP头组成。

Result: SRSNet在多个领域的真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能。SRS作为即插即用模块也能提升现有基于分块模型的性能。

Conclusion: 选择性表示空间方法能够有效提升时间序列预测性能，为基于分块的模型提供了新的增强途径。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的严格方法来确定概率张量模型中的秩可识别性，将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，并应用于四种基础张量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量分解中潜在维度（秩）的选择通常依赖启发式方法，缺乏严格的数学基础，需要一种系统化的秩可识别性分析方法。

Method: 通过将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，建立秩可识别性与系统可解性之间的等价关系，并推导出基于观测数据矩的显式闭式秩估计器。

Result: 证明PARAFAC/CP、Tensor Train和Tensor Ring模型的秩可识别，而Tucker模型由于对称拓扑导致系统欠定，秩不可识别。经验验证了估计器的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为张量分解中的秩选择提供了严格的数学框架，对于可识别模型能够仅基于观测数据矩推导出闭式秩估计器。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

TL;DR: 提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过动态熵平衡机制解决代理强化学习中过度依赖熵信号导致的训练崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流代理强化学习算法在熵引导下自主探索高不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖熵信号会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并结合熵感知优势估计优先学习高不确定性token。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上的结果显示，AEPO始终优于7种主流RL算法。仅使用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B结合AEPO在GAIA上达到47.6% Pass@1和65.0% Pass@5，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2% Pass@1和26.0% Pass@5，在WebWalker上达到43.0% Pass@1和70.0% Pass@5。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，有助于可扩展的web代理训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MX+格式，一种基于块浮点数(BFP)的4位低精度格式扩展，通过重新利用异常值的指数域作为扩展尾数来提高精度，在保持存储开销和速度损失可忽略的同时，显著提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超低比特BFP变体由于块中的异常值而难以提供合理的语言模型性能，需要一种成本效益高且非侵入性的解决方案来改进微缩放(MX)格式。

Method: MX+扩展基于关键洞察：异常值不需要使用其元素数据类型中的指数域，因此可以重新利用指数域作为扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: 评估显示MX+相比4位MX格式(MXFP4)实现了显著更高的模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略，为高效LLM推理提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+为块浮点数格式提供了一种有效的异常值处理机制，在4位精度下实现了接近MXFP6的性能，是MXFP4或MXFP6的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 现有图OOD检测方法虽然利用数据为中心的技术提取有效表示，但其性能仍受结构冗余导致的语义偏移影响。

Method: 提出冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，将目标分解为基本信息和无关冗余，通过最小化结构熵来减少解耦的冗余，并提出理论上的上下界进行优化。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验显示，RedOUT在OOD检测方面表现优异，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上显著超越最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT框架通过集成结构熵有效解决了图OOD检测中的结构冗余问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Motivation: Transformer在处理表格数据时存在序列长度的二次复杂度问题，而状态空间模型（SSM）虽然效率更高，但对输入顺序敏感，这在行顺序无意义的表格数据中是不理想的。

Method: 使用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型替代TabPFN中的Transformer，通过双向上下文聚合来减少对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法显著降低了顺序依赖性，预测性能与原TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra作为Transformer的替代方案，在保持高效性的同时，通过双向方法有效解决了SSM对输入顺序敏感的问题，为表格数据的基础模型提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出Conformal Labeling方法，通过控制错误发现率(FDR)来识别AI预测可被证明可信的实例，确保AI分配标签的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在标注大规模数据时因不可避免的标注错误导致标签质量下降的问题，现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI标注质量的理论保证。

Method: 构建每个测试实例的conformal p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例的误标置信度，选择p值低于数据相关阈值的实例，证明AI预测可信。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种任务（图像和文本标注、LLM QA）中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功效。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法提供了AI标注质量的理论保证，能够有效控制标注错误率，提高AI标注的可靠性。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and

standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

TL;DR: LeapFactual是一种基于条件流匹配的新型反事实解释算法，能够生成可靠且信息丰富的反事实解释，即使在真实和学习决策边界不一致的情况下也能工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习和人工智能模型在高风险领域（如医疗保健和科学研究）的应用日益增多，需要不仅准确而且可解释的模型。现有反事实解释方法存在梯度消失、潜在空间不连续以及对学习与真实决策边界对齐过度依赖等关键限制。

Method: LeapFactual采用条件流匹配方法生成反事实解释，遵循模型无关的方法，不限于具有可微分损失函数的模型，甚至可以处理人机交互系统。

Result: 在基准和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，LeapFactual能够生成准确且符合分布的反事实解释，提供可操作的见解。可靠的反事实样本可以作为新的训练数据来增强模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够增强科学知识发现和非专家可解释性。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

Motivation: 解决无监督领域自适应中的分布偏移问题，现有方法通常使用临时相似性度量在嵌入空间中对齐源域和目标域的低阶统计矩，缺乏几何原理支撑。

Result: 在图像去噪和图像分类基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，代码已公开。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼流形距离方法能够更忠实地进行跨域比较，并与目标域误差边界相关联。

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

TL;DR: 提出FedPPA方法解决联邦学习中模型和数据异构性问题，通过渐进式参数对齐和基于熵的加权平均来提升个性化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实联邦学习场景中客户端存在计算资源异构和非IID数据分布，现有个性化联邦学习方法未能同时处理模型和数据异构问题

Method: 渐进式参数对齐(FedPPA)：逐步对齐客户端通用层与全局模型权重，结合基于熵的加权平均策略

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedPPA优于现有联邦学习算法，在个性化适应方面表现优异

Conclusion: FedPPA能有效缓解全局与局部模型不一致性，同时保留客户端本地知识，增强非IID环境下的个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Seesaw方法，通过将学习率乘以1/√2同时加倍批处理大小来替代传统学习率减半策略，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤，加速大语言模型预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批处理大小增加是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于Adam等自适应优化器的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 开发了批处理大小调度的原则性框架Seesaw：当标准调度器要减半学习率时，Seesaw改为将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批处理大小。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下匹配余弦衰减性能，同时减少约36%的挂钟时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw方法为批处理大小调度提供了理论依据，在实践中显著加速训练过程，接近理论最优性能。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

### [206] [Tawa: Automatic Warp Specialization for Modern GPUs with Asynchronous References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14719)
*Hongzheng Chen,Bin Fan,Alexander Collins,Bastian Hagedorn,Evghenii Gaburov,Masahiro Masuda,Matthew Brookhart,Chris Sullivan,Jason Knight,Zhiru Zhang,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动化编译器，能够从高级瓦片化程序系统生成高性能的warp专用代码，通过异步引用抽象简化GPU编程，在H100 GPU上实现优于cuBLAS和Triton的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的专用硬件单元支持高性能异步数据流执行，但传统的SIMT编程模型与这种任务并行硬件不匹配，导致程序可编程性差距。硬件级的warp专业化虽然能实现峰值性能，但需要开发者手动编排复杂的低级通信和软件管道，过程繁琐易错。

Method: 提出Tawa编译器，采用新颖的异步引用IR抽象来表达warp级通信，无需暴露低级硬件细节。自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，并管理复杂的数据流管道，避免开发者进行侵入式内核重写。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估代表性LLM内核，Tawa实现了高达1.1倍于高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核的加速。对于注意力工作负载，Tawa比Triton快1.2倍，并与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核性能相当，但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专用代码生成，成功弥合了GPU编程的可编程性差距，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了开发复杂性。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一个多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO工具，能发现更多独特故障并减少故障发现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的故障场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和Pareto前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理上评估：人形步行者、自动驾驶汽车和停车代理。INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别比INDAGO多发现83%和40%的独特故障，同时在所有代理中减少故障发现时间达67%。

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试有效性，能够发现更多样化的故障场景并加速故障发现过程。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下一词预测(NTP)在长程推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测(MTP)只能捕获短程依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能有效处理长期依赖的方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测(FSP)，训练辅助头来预测长期未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要（如词袋摘要）和学习的摘要（使用从右向左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入）。

Result: 大规模预训练实验（3B和8B参数模型）表明，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试中相比NTP和MTP都有改进。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长期未来的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型的长程推理能力，为改进语言模型的长期依赖建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，证明了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏性在现代GPU上能加速训练和推理，但在准确率上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限。

Method: 为每个层学习一个置换矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块、N:M和对角线三种典型结构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下匹配非结构化基线准确率，同时训练加速1.21倍，推理加速2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构+学习置换的组合在准确率和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在概念漂移和时间偏移两种分布漂移。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，而针对时间序列预测的概念漂移方法研究相对较少，需要设计专门的方法来应对这两种漂移。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过统一处理时间偏移和概念漂移，有效提升了时间序列预测模型的性能，证明了同时解决两种分布漂移的重要性。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖特征工程，神经网络能自动学习表示但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。希望找到既能自动学习有用表示又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 使用LLM合成特征函数代码，结合决策树构建LeaPR模型。提出两种算法：FunSearch的改进版本学习特征，以及ID3算法的变体在分裂节点时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务上，LeaPR模型学习到高质量的非神经网络预测器，性能与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一种灵活的可解释端到端学习范式，特征和预测结果都可以被直接检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Motivation: 揭示SSMs在真正长序列生成任务中的理论局限性，并探索通过工具增强来克服这些限制的方法。

Method: 允许SSMs交互式访问外部工具，结合问题相关的训练数据，使SSMs能够学习解决任何可处理问题。

Result: 工具增强的SSMs在算术、推理和编程任务上实现了显著的序列长度泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSMs在交互式工具和智能体场景中，是Transformers的高效替代方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Motivation: 6G多RAT网络中，蜂窝和WiFi共存需要可靠的移动性决策，但现有切换机制反应式、基于瞬时测量，无法应对快速信道动态和异构覆盖。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Conclusion: 该方法在遗忘效果和干净准确率权衡方面始终优于现有最先进防御方法，证明了后门与良性任务在权重空间中的解耦特性为安全防御提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Motivation: 研究真实数据集上的核回归学习曲线预测问题，旨在建立从数据集结构直接映射到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出Hermite特征结构假设(HEA)，通过数据协方差矩阵和目标函数的经验多项式分解来近似核的特征值和特征函数，从而预测学习曲线。在Gaussian数据上证明HEA，并在真实图像数据上验证其有效性。

Result: HEA在CIFAR-5m、SVHN和ImageNet等真实图像数据集上表现良好，能够准确预测学习曲线。此外发现MLP在特征学习阶段也按照HEA预测的顺序学习Hermite多项式。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端学习理论是可行的，为非平凡学习算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

Motivation: 在高风险AI应用中，标准赌博机算法的激进探索可能导致不可逆损害。现有方法依赖导师帮助，但导师不一定总是可用。

Method: 提出两动作上下文赌博机模型，包含弃权选项。设计基于谨慎的算法，只在可信区域内执行任务策略，避免在证据不足时冒险。

Result: 在i.i.d.输入假设下，建立了次线性遗憾保证，证明谨慎探索在高风险环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够安全部署学习智能体，避免不可逆错误，同时保持学习效率。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、策划数据集或验证器，在不易验证的领域具有广泛适用性，表明基础模型本身就具备强大的推理潜力

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Method: 开发了一种新的扩散强制采样器，在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现高达5倍的加速。

Conclusion: 循环深度模型可以自然地被视为强大的连续（尽管是因果的）扩散语言模型，为在推理时并行化额外计算提供了高效机制。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

Motivation: 传统IRT方法使用logistic链接函数会引入曲率破坏数据的可加性结构，而TVD-MI的二元比较数据平均后产生具有可加性结构的中心概率分数，更适合使用恒等链接函数。

Method: 从Gini熵最大化推导出剪裁线性模型，采用箱约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题，使用恒等链接函数而非非线性转换来保持TVD-MI的几何结构。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下实现保持集RMSE 0.117±0.008，同时保持代理排名（Spearman ρ=0.972±0.015），评估次数比全密集评估减少三倍。不同评委间在代理排名上表现出强一致性（ρ=0.872）。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何结构通过恒等映射得到最佳保持，为高效LLM评估提供了有效方法，并适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合数千个SNP与多组学数据及先验生物知识，显著提高了预测准确性并揭示了非线性生物学关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型依赖直接映射，准确性有限，育种者需进行大规模田间试验。整合中间分子表型如基因表达的模型虽能提高预测拟合度，但在部署时不可行。BINNs旨在克服这一限制。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，在训练时利用多组学数据，在推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，并在合成代谢组学基准测试中使用完整领域知识。

Result: 在稀疏数据条件下，BINN将排名相关准确性提高了56%，非线性识别了GWAS/TWAS未能发现的基因。在合成代谢组学基准中，相对于传统神经网络将预测误差降低了75%，并正确识别了最重要的非线性通路。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性的框架，揭示了可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先级的非线性生物学关系。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为，实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

### [228] [Debiased Kernel Estimation of Spot Volatility in the Presence of Infinite Variation Jumps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14285)
*B. Cooper Boniece,José E. Figueroa-López,Tianwei Zhou*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的截断核基估计器及其去偏变体，用于估计具有无界变化跳跃的Itô半鞅的瞬时波动率，将跳跃活动指数的效率边界从Y<4/3提升到Y<20/11，几乎覆盖了所有允许范围Y<2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融计量经济学中波动率估计在跳跃活动较高时变得特别具有挑战性，这在高度交易的金融证券中经常观察到。

Method: 构建了截断核基估计器和去偏变体，使用无界核函数，在更灵活的模型假设下具有更广泛的适用性。

Result: 新方法通过使用无界核函数获得了更小的渐近方差，实现更简单，并在有限样本中显著优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的估计器扩展了瞬时波动率估计的效率边界，几乎覆盖了整个允许的跳跃活动范围，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Volatility estimation is a central problem in financial econometrics, but
becomes particularly challenging when jump activity is high, a phenomenon
observed empirically in highly traded financial securities. In this paper, we
revisit the problem of spot volatility estimation for an It\^o semimartingale
with jumps of unbounded variation. We construct truncated kernel-based
estimators and debiased variants that extend the efficiency frontier for spot
volatility estimation in terms of the jump activity index $Y$, raising the
previous bound $Y<4/3$ to $Y<20/11$, thereby covering nearly the entire
admissible range $Y<2$. Compared with earlier work, our approach attains
smaller asymptotic variances through the use of unbounded kernels, is simpler
to implement, and has broader applicability under more flexible model
assumptions. A comprehensive simulation study confirms that our procedures
substantially outperform competing methods in finite samples.

### [229] [Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: A Continuous Functional Framework from Navier-Stokes Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14409)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程的动态空间处理效应边界理论框架，将处理强度定义为时空连续函数，建立了具有自相似解的处理效应标度律，并通过卫星观测数据验证了方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散处理效应估计方法无法充分捕捉空间处理效应的传播动态和边界演化，需要建立连续函数框架来统一分析处理效应的时空动态特性。

Method: 基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程建立连续函数框架，利用Kummer合流超几何函数和修正贝塞尔函数获得精确自相似解，通过4200万TROPOMI卫星观测数据和蒙特卡洛模拟进行实证验证。

Result: 实证显示NO2污染呈现强指数空间衰减（κs=0.004/km，R²=0.35），检测边界达572km。蒙特卡洛模拟显示在边界检测和假阳性避免方面优于离散参数方法（94% vs 27%正确拒绝）。区域异质性分析验证了诊断能力。

Conclusion: 连续函数视角统一了空间计量经济学与数学物理，为环境经济学、银行和医疗等领域的边界检测、暴露量化和政策评估提供了理论基础方法。

Abstract: I develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for dynamic spatial treatment
effect boundaries using continuous functional definitions grounded in
Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment
effect estimators, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as a
continuous function $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous
analysis of propagation dynamics, boundary evolution, and cumulative exposure
patterns. Building on exact self-similar solutions expressible through Kummer
confluent hypergeometric and modified Bessel functions, I establish that
treatment effects follow scaling laws $\tau(d, t) = t^{-\alpha} f(d/t^\beta)$
where exponents characterize diffusion mechanisms. Empirical validation using
42 million TROPOMI satellite observations of NO$_2$ pollution from U.S.
coal-fired power plants demonstrates strong exponential spatial decay
($\kappa_s = 0.004$ per km, $R^2 = 0.35$) with detectable boundaries at 572 km.
Monte Carlo simulations confirm superior performance over discrete parametric
methods in boundary detection and false positive avoidance (94\% vs 27\%
correct rejection). Regional heterogeneity analysis validates diagnostic
capability: positive decay parameters within 100 km confirm coal plant
dominance; negative parameters beyond 100 km correctly signal when urban
sources dominate. The continuous functional perspective unifies spatial
econometrics with mathematical physics, providing theoretically grounded
methods for boundary detection, exposure quantification, and policy evaluation
across environmental economics, banking, and healthcare applications.

### [230] [Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique): Finding Model Validity Through Decision-Maker Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13858)
*Raheleh Biglari,Joachim Denil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策一致性的模型有效性验证方法DOTechnique，通过评估替代模型是否与高保真模型产生相同决策来确定有效性区域，无需预定义有效性边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型有效性验证方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分。需要一种更灵活的方法来确定模型在决策支持中的有效性。

Method: 开发了决策导向技术(DOTechnique)，通过比较替代模型与高保真模型的决策一致性来识别有效性区域，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域，证明了该技术在识别模型有效性方面的潜力。

Conclusion: DOTechnique通过决策者上下文支持模型有效性发现，提供了一种基于决策一致性而非输出相似性的模型有效性验证新方法。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合视觉信息（特别是演示幻灯片）的多模态自动语音识别方法，相比仅使用音频的基线模型，在领域特定术语识别上实现了35%的相对词错误率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SOTA ASR系统主要依赖音频信息而忽略多模态上下文，但视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要。特别是在科学演示场景中，演示幻灯片能为领域特定术语识别提供重要上下文。

Method: 1. 创建多模态演示基准数据集，包括领域特定术语的自动分析；2. 探索用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法；3. 通过数据增强方法解决缺乏配套幻灯片数据集的问题；4. 使用增强数据集训练模型。

Result: 训练得到的模型在所有词汇上实现了约34%的相对词错误率降低，在领域特定术语上实现了35%的相对词错误率降低，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 集成演示幻灯片等视觉信息能显著提升ASR系统性能，特别是在领域特定术语识别方面，证明了多模态方法在科学演示场景中的有效性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在零相关情境下会系统性地产生因果错觉，错误推断不存在的因果关系，这支持了LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究因果学习中的认知偏差——因果错觉，并检验大型语言模型是否也会出现这种偏差，特别是在需要准确因果推理的领域中。

Method: 构建了1000个医疗情境下的零相关场景数据集，使用LLMs评估潜在原因的效力，基于经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果错觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，对在需要准确因果推理的领域中使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

### [233] [GammaZero: Learning To Guide POMDP Belief Space Search With Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14035)
*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero提出了一个基于动作中心图表示的学习框架，用于在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中指导规划。该方法通过图神经网络学习小规模问题的启发式函数，并能零样本泛化到更大规模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在开发一个统一的图表示框架，实现跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器-解码器架构从小规模问题中学习价值函数和策略，然后将学到的启发式函数应用于大规模问题的蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了POMDP规划的可扩展性和泛化能力，为复杂决策问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

*Shriyash Upadhyay,Chaithanya Bandi,Narmeen Oozeer,Philip Quirke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种替代性监管方法：要求大型AI实验室发布小型、开放的类比模型，这些模型是从其最大专有模型蒸馏训练而来，作为公共代理，允许广泛参与安全验证和可解释性研究，同时避免披露全尺寸模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿AI模型监管提案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保AI安全又能积极促进创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型、开放访问的类比模型，这些模型以类似方式训练并从其最大专有模型蒸馏而来，作为公共代理。

Result: 研究表明，使用这些较小模型开发的安全和可解释性方法能有效泛化到前沿规模系统，降低监管负担并加速安全进步。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法成本最小，利用可重用资源，显著促进公共利益，通过更深入理解模型来缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者兼得。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

### [235] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标MDP和投票理论的共识声明生成框架，通过随机策略保证事前核心稳定性，或通过搜索算法最大化平等福利，实验证明相比基线方法能改善最差情况下的代理对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识声明生成框架缺乏可证明公平性保证的结构，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时提供公平性证明。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、token级MDP，每个目标对应代理偏好。基于投票理论提出两种方法：1）保证事前核心稳定性的随机生成策略；2）使用搜索算法最大化平等福利生成单一声明。

Result: 实验显示，基于平等福利目标的搜索生成的共识声明相比基线方法（包括Habermas Machine）在代理对齐的最差情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了具有可证明公平性保证的结构化方法，通过结合MDP和投票理论实现了更好的公平性表现。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统面临的三大挑战：空间-时间信息利用不足、缺乏严格安全保证、系统复杂性。

Method: 结合GCN-Transformer融合架构的空间-时间图表示学习框架来捕捉建筑间关系和时间模式，以及集成控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体RL算法。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上，STEMS实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，仅0.13的不适比例保持最佳舒适度。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强大鲁棒性，并在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI智能体系统的行为推理提供了统一的语义基础，解决了当前碎片化协议带来的挑战，为构建安全可靠的智能体AI系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像来预测文化遗产地的退化程度，在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态方法提升43%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境应力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 采用改进的PerceiverIO架构，包含简化编码器（64D潜在空间）和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，鼓励模态互补性而非冗余。

Result: 模型准确率达76.9%，传感器单独为61.5%，图像单独为46.2%，确认了成功的多模态协同效应。超参数研究发现最佳相关性目标τ=0.3。

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的文化遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

Conclusion: RL与行为树的交叉点是一个值得进一步探索的关键节点，尽管在多个研究论文中已被提出，但其实际应用仍然罕见。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

TL;DR: ARM-FM是一个利用基础模型自动生成奖励机器的强化学习框架，能够从自然语言规范自动构建结构化奖励函数，实现任务分解和零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数规范高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。现有方法需要手动设计奖励函数，过程复杂且容易出错。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器（RM），将语言嵌入与RM自动机状态关联，实现跨任务泛化。

Result: 在多个挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，包括展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型的高层推理能力和奖励机器的结构化形式，为强化学习提供了自动化的组合式奖励设计解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个在线骚扰代理基准，包括多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法和混合评估框架。研究发现微调越狱使骚扰成功率大幅提升，封闭源和开源模型表现出不同的升级轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰往往在多轮交互中展开，需要评估LLM代理在多轮交互中的安全性。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（内存、规划、微调）和混合评估框架的基准测试系统。

Result: 微调越狱使骚扰成功率从57.25-64.19%提升至95.78-96.89%（Llama），从98.46%提升至99.33%（Gemini），拒绝率降至1-2%。侮辱和谩骂是最普遍的毒性行为。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，需要开发强大的安全防护措施来确保在线平台的安全和负责任。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为深度研究系统提供了严格的评估基础，识别了当前系统的局限性和未来发展方向，推动了可靠、有洞察力的深度研究系统的进步。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，实现基于LLM的智能体规模化训练。

Method: 提出ASL框架，包含提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型，在共享工具环境和LLM骨干网络中形成任务生成、策略执行和评估的闭环强化学习。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化能够实现可扩展的自改进智能体。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Motivation: 现有评估大模型推理能力的基准测试范围有限，缺乏根据模型推理能力演化而调整难度的灵活性。

Method: 从现有基准和奥林匹克竞赛中收集复杂推理问题，利用模型推理过程中的关键陈述自适应修改问题分析难度，并使用仿真软件生成可动态调整难度的问题。

Conclusion: MorphoBench提高了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为提升大模型推理能力和科学稳健性提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个在微调过程中保护大语言模型安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间来防止安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预处理的奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关部分，并构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的响应。

Result: 在多个下游任务上，GuardSpace优于现有方法，特别是对Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，有害评分从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace框架能有效保护大语言模型在微调过程中的安全对齐，同时保持任务性能，为安全微调提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供快速原型设计、评估和防御迭代的工具，展示了框架在多种攻击场景下的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来快速原型设计、评估和迭代防御措施。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我修正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题时容易受到级联错误的影响，单个错误步骤可能在整个系统中传播并破坏任务轨迹。

Method: 采用历史条件异常评分方法，包括：1）下一执行重建，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；2）原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重建和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC显著优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同MAS框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: MASC的元认知监控和针对性修正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，为多智能体系统提供了有效的错误检测和修正机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和数学大语言模型中的推理相关参数，将其投影到MLLM的子空间进行融合，从而直接提升MLLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的数学推理能力落后于纯文本大语言模型（LLM），作者希望探索能否让MLLM直接从现成的数学LLM中吸收数学推理能力，而无需进行复杂的训练。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间以保持对齐；3）在子空间中合并参数。该方法无需调优，直接调整参数。

Result: 大量实验表明，IP-Merging方法能够在不损害MLLM其他能力的情况下，直接从数学LLM中增强MLLM的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging提供了一种有效的免调优方法，成功地将数学LLM的推理能力迁移到MLLM中，解决了参数空间不对齐的问题，显著提升了MLLM的数学推理性能。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，展示了在复杂移动控制场景中的强大适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著超越MAS性能，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中表现不佳，即使精心设计的提示和先验信息下，GPT-4o在TravelPlanner数据集上仅达7%通过率。多智能体系统虽能改进集体推理，但存在推理成本高、延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理和规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，通过简单的端到端训练，使小规模模型不仅能获得MAS的结构化推理规划能力，还能显著超越其性能。

Result: 使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型，经IMAGINE训练后在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，显著提升了推理规划性能，同时解决了MAS的高成本和训练难题，为复杂任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

### [255] [Eliminating Negative Occurrences of Derived Predicates from PDDL Axioms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14412)
*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制与分层公理集在表达能力上是等价的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能用于直接由动作设置的谓词，而非派生谓词。但文献中常偏离此限制，仅要求公理集可分层。本文旨在证明这两种变体在表达能力上是等价的。

Method: 提出相应的转换方法，通过消除派生谓词的负出现，将包含负出现的公理集转换为符合PDDL标准限制的形式。

Result: 证明了两种变体（PDDL标准限制和分层公理集）能够表达完全相同的查询，即最小不动点逻辑所表达的查询。

Conclusion: 派生谓词的负出现在PDDL公理中可以被消除，PDDL标准限制与分层公理集在表达能力上是等价的。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

TL;DR: Helmsman是一个多智能体系统，通过模拟研发流程自动合成联邦学习系统，包括交互式规划、模块化代码生成和自主评估优化，在AgentFL-Bench基准测试中表现优于人工设计的基线方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习系统设计复杂，需要处理数据异构性和系统约束等多方面挑战，导致解决方案脆弱且定制化。需要自动化工具来简化这一过程。

Method: Helmsman采用三阶段协作方法：1）交互式人机循环规划制定研究计划；2）监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成；3）在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环流程。

Result: 在包含16个多样化任务的AgentFL-Bench基准测试中，Helmsman生成的解决方案与人工设计的基线方案相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步，证明了多智能体系统在联邦学习系统设计中的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望超越简单的文本交互，需要LLM与外部工具交互。但工具数量增加导致提示膨胀，带来高成本、高延迟和工具选择不准确的问题。

Method: 提出JSPLIT框架，将工具组织成层次化分类学，根据用户提示和分类结构识别并仅包含最相关的工具。

Result: JSPLIT显著减小提示大小，在工具数量大幅增加时甚至能提高工具选择准确性，有效降低成本同时提升高复杂度环境中的任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架能有效管理提示大小，解决工具数量增加带来的提示膨胀问题，在保持响应效果的同时降低成本并提升任务成功率。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理能力增强，研究其是否能成为具有自主性的实体，能够规划、设计任务并推理更广泛模糊的目标。

Method: 在开放式实验环境中增强预训练LLM代理，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并与环境广泛互动，进行定性研究。

Result: 代理能可靠执行复杂多步指令、跨运行存储和重用信息、提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感、易产生重复任务、无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究显示了预训练LLM向开放式发展的潜力与当前局限，为未来训练代理管理记忆、有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一个图结构基准测试框架，用于评估移动设备上的复杂长时程任务，支持多有效解决方案验证和原子级能力分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动代理评估方法存在局限：离线静态基准只能验证单一预定义路径，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可复现性，两者都无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过建模真实设备交互中观察到的有限状态，实现动态行为的静态模拟，开发了包含175个任务（74个单应用、101个跨应用）的ColorBench基准，每个任务包含至少两条正确路径和典型错误路径。

Result: 通过在各种基线模型上评估ColorBench，发现了现有模型的局限性，并基于实验结果提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径。

Conclusion: ColorBench框架填补了离线和在线评估之间的差距，提高了测试稳定性，能够更全面地评估移动代理在复杂长时程任务上的能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，将AI对齐问题重新定义为认知治理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且具有情感共鸣，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险。它们实现了规模化系统1认知，但缺乏反思和证伪能力。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维诊断框架：地图vs领土（认识论vs本体论）、直觉vs理性（双过程理论）、冲突vs确认（批判性测试vs相互验证）。

Result: 该框架不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类理解对齐，直觉（无论是人类还是人工的）必须由人类理性来治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估当前研究中对算法偏见的识别、讨论和报告情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具（整合了Cochrane偏见风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表），对35篇同行评审研究进行了系统分析。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据抽样和缺失数据处理记录良好，但大多数研究缺乏明确的公平性框架、亚组分析和潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性导向框架（认知、概念化、应用、报告），为公共卫生ML从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进而非损害健康公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，使用图执行器遍历TITAN本体图检索事实答案和证据，基于MITRE构建双向类型化图谱。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的连接，为网络威胁情报分析提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Conclusion: NAEL为人工智能体提供了一个非人类中心主义的伦理框架，能够产生适应性、情境敏感的伦理行为，克服了传统人类中心主义伦理模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Motivation: COUP算法配置方法主要关注理论保证而忽略了实际性能，本文旨在弥合这一差距，使基于效用的算法配置方法在实际应用中具有竞争力。

Method: 提出了一系列对COUP的改进措施，这些改进在不降低理论保证的前提下提升了算法的实证性能，并通过实验验证了这些改进的效果。

Conclusion: 本文成功将基于效用的算法配置方法提升到了实用水平，为算法配置提供了理论保证和实际性能兼备的解决方案，并展示了如何分析算法选择对效用函数变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，可应用于各种基于任务向量的合并方法，在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构中证明有效

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量，减少冗余冲突，显著提升模型合并性能

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST是一个认知对齐的时空大语言模型框架，通过自然语言接口整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和用户信息，用于下一个兴趣点推荐任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和序列移动模式的理解，且工业级POI推荐需要整合世界知识和人类认知对齐（如季节、天气、假期、用户画像等）来提升用户体验和推荐性能。

Method: CoAST框架包含两个阶段：(1) 通过继续预训练在脱敏用户的丰富时空轨迹数据上获取推荐知识；(2) 使用监督微调和强化学习阶段，通过丰富训练数据将认知判断与人类偏好对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的离线实验和部署在AMAP App首页"猜你想去"的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架能够有效整合世界知识和时空轨迹模式，通过认知对齐提升下一个兴趣点推荐的性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升LLM在结构化输出（如函数调用）任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）方面的应用研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度调用内过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注以提供步骤级奖励；开发ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤；结合细粒度束搜索进行推理扩展。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型；配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提高了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SimKO方法解决RLVR中的过度集中问题，通过不对称设计提升探索能力，改善pass@K性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏向利用而非探索的问题，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降，需要理解并解决这一训练动态问题

Method: 分析RLVR训练动态，发现概率集中效应，提出SimKO方法：对正确响应提升top-K候选概率，对错误响应惩罚top-1候选，特别在高熵token上应用

Result: 在多个数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO显著提升了各种K值的pass@K性能

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解概率过度集中问题，有效改进了RLVR的探索能力，为优化强化学习验证奖励提供了简单有效的方法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个代理系统，通过交互式循环减少LLM处理NL2SQL任务时所需的元信息量，从而显著降低token使用量和处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token使用量大、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理系统设计，使用交互式循环和推理框架，让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上评估，Datalake Agent将LLM使用的token减少高达87%，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过减少元信息使用，实现了显著的成本降低，同时维持了NL2SQL任务的性能。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Motivation: 提升具身代理在长视野操作任务中的推理能力，解决现有视觉语言模型在复杂真实环境中执行长时程操作任务时面临的常识和推理能力限制问题。

Method: 两阶段微调框架：监督训练通过专家序列获取基础知识，然后使用强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足。设计了基于规则的奖励函数，同时考虑长时程性能和动作约束。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练的推理模型，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini 21.33%，并超过其他在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段微调框架有效提升了具身代理的推理能力，在复杂真实环境的长时程操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过提升LLM对提示指令的遵循率来解决多指令冲突问题，在SCALEDIF基准测试中显示对2条指令提升7个百分点，对10条指令提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试（最多10条指令），开发定量冲突评分工具分析指令冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提升指令遵循率，2条指令提升7个百分点，10条指令提升4个百分点；发现性能下降与指令间紧张冲突程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting有效提高多指令场景下的LLM可靠性，冲突评分工具为开发者提供了评估额外指令对模型性能影响的反馈机制。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现中取得进展，但搜索效果依赖于如何将领域先验编码到结构化假设空间中，需要形式化理论来描述和测量这种搜索过程。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，约束在固定安全包络内；通过单参数加权所有可达路径得到覆盖生成函数，诱导出可达性难度度量；提供可测试的推理并通过多数投票实例验证。

Result: 建立了描述LLM辅助迭代搜索的紧凑形式理论，提供了衡量智能体及其搜索空间的操作工具，为迭代搜索提供了几何解释和系统化形式描述。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了可行的语言和操作工具，能够系统地形式化描述和测量智能体在领域先验指导下的搜索过程。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架来解决LLM代理在复杂系统交互中的上下文限制和状态同步问题，通过潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文来提高可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时面临上下文窗口有限和状态不同步的问题，导致不可靠输出、不可预测行为和资源使用效率低下，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，让代理先在低保真度的潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需策略性地请求高保真上下文，所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行中介。

Result: 在软件开发的Sage参考实现中，该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和基于现实的AI代理提供了基础方法学。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的智能体，能够在没有标注数据或模型权重更新的情况下自我改进，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，从而提高企业日志数据模式映射的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成来自多个第三方供应商的日志数据，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配、格式混乱或不完整，导致模式映射面临挑战。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励来迭代优化映射。该方法在推理过程中自我改进，无需标注样本或模型权重更新。

Result: 在将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式的实验中，该方法将映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)，最终达到93.94%(100次迭代后)。同时将需要专家评审的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 这种新方法提供了一种证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为未来行业问题提供了更鲁棒、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作性的解决方案路径。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证不仅是对自一致性的免费升级，也是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过自信问题提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: H-Risk能预测过自信错误，即使系统在形式上稳定；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合影响。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈的混合奖励机制，仅需10%数据量即可在ProcessBench上实现26%相对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：奖励噪声大、事实保真度低、与步骤级推理目标不对齐。传统方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估，或仅从结果推断步骤质量的蒙特卡洛估计，导致监督信号嘈杂且不对齐。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2) 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供基于执行的正确性信号；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万个自动标注样本（最佳PRM所需数据的10%），在ProcessBench上实现高达26%的相对平均性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至优于使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM提供了一种可扩展且可验证的高质量过程级推理路径，通过树引导和保真度感知的自动过程监督，有效解决了现有PRM的核心限制。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

### [282] [A Global Systems Perspective on Food Demand, Deforestation and Agricultural Sustainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14720)
*Moretti Elia,Loreau Michel,Benzaquen Michael*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个全球模型，分析不同政策情景下粮食生产与生态系统的关系，发现单纯供给侧措施会引发补偿性土地扩张，需求侧措施（特别是减少肉类消费）能同时缓解集约化和扩张压力，而综合政策组合效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球人口增长和财富增加带来的粮食需求压力与生态系统保护之间的矛盾，特别关注动物产品需求上升对生态系统的负面影响。

Method: 开发了一个空间明确的全球模型，将外生粮食需求轨迹与作物和畜牧业生产、土地转换以及生态系统完整性反馈联系起来，校准了1960年后的人口、收入、产量、投入和土地利用趋势。

Result: 供给侧措施往往引发补偿性土地扩张，削弱生态收益；需求侧变化（特别是减少肉类消费）能同时缓解集约化和扩张压力；综合政策组合表现优于任何单一措施。

Conclusion: 零散的干预措施难以解决系统层面的权衡问题，只有联合限制土地转换、缓和投入集约化并抑制需求的综合政策组合，才能最有可能将全球粮食供应控制在生态限度内。

Abstract: Feeding a larger and wealthier global population without transgressing
ecological limits is increasingly challenging, as rising food demand
(especially for animal products) intensifies pressure on ecosystems,
accelerates deforestation, and erodes biodiversity and soil health. We develop
a stylized, spatially explicit global model that links exogenous food-demand
trajectories to crop and livestock production, land conversion, and feedbacks
from ecosystem integrity that, in turn, shape future yields and land needs.
Calibrated to post-1960 trends in population, income, yields, input use, and
land use, the model reproduces the joint rise of crop and meat demand and the
associated expansion and intensification of agriculture. We use it to compare
business-as-usual, supply-side, demand-side, and mixed-policy scenarios. Three
results stand out. First, productivity-oriented supply-side measures (e.g.
reduced chemical inputs, organic conversion, lower livestock density) often
trigger compensatory land expansion that undermines ecological gains-so that
supply-side action alone cannot halt deforestation or widespread degradation.
Second, demand-side change, particularly reduced meat consumption, consistently
relieves both intensification and expansion pressures; in our simulations, only
substantial demand reductions (on the order of 40% of projected excess demand
by 2100) deliver simultaneous increases in forest area and declines in degraded
land. Third, integrated policy portfolios that jointly constrain land
conversion, temper input intensification, and curb demand outperform any single
lever. Together, these findings clarify the system-level trade-offs that
frustrate piecemeal interventions and identify the policy combinations most
likely to keep global food provision within ecological limits.

### [283] [Strategic Behavior in Crowdfunding: Insights from a Large-Scale Online Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14872)
*Din Amir,Bar Hoter,Moran Koren*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 通过大规模在线实验验证众筹中的战略行为，发现众筹机制相比投票更易引发风险规避和相互保险行为，信号准确性和参与阈值对行为有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Arieli等人2023年的模型，研究众筹中的战略行为，重点关注信息激励而非动态效应，验证风险规避和相互保险等理论预测。

Method: 使用大规模在线实验，在静态单次众筹游戏中测试风险规避和相互保险行为，比较不同信号准确性和参与阈值下的行为差异。

Result: 验证了关键理论预测：众筹机制相比投票更易引发战略行为；高信号准确性降低风险规避但增加相互保险；提高参与阈值反而增强风险规避，可能与认知约束有关。

Conclusion: 研究确认了信息激励对众筹行为的影响，发现了与标准模型不符的行为偏差，为平台设计和机制优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study examines strategic behavior in crowdfunding using a large-scale
online experiment. Building on the model of Arieli et. al 2023, we test
predictions about risk aversion (i.e., opting out despite seeing a positive
private signal) and mutual insurance (i.e., opting in despite seeing a negative
private signal) in a static, single-shot crowdfunding game, focusing on
informational incentives rather than dynamic effects. Our results validate key
theoretical predictions: crowdfunding mechanisms induce distinct strategic
behaviors compared to voting, where participants are more likely to follow
private signals (odds ratio: 0.139, $p < 0.001$). Additionally, the study
demonstrates that higher signal accuracy (85\% vs. 55\%) decreases risk
aversion (odds ratio: 0.414, $p = 0.024$) but increases reliance on mutual
insurance (odds ratio: 2.532, $p = 0.026$). However, contrary to theory,
increasing the required participation threshold (50\% to 80\%) amplifies risk
aversion (odds ratio: 3.251, $p = 0.005$), which, pending further
investigation, may indicate cognitive constraints.
  Furthermore, we show that while mutual insurance supports participation, it
may hinder information aggregation, particularly as signal accuracy increases.
These findings advance crowdfunding theory by confirming the impact of
informational incentives and identifying behavioral deviations that challenge
standard models, offering insights for platform design and mechanism
refinement.
