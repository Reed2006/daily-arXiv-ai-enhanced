### [1] [Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition using GLiNER-BioMed with Targeted Dictionary-Based Post-processing for BioASQ 2025 task 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08588)
*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioNER任务上的表现，引入基于词典的后处理策略来改善基因和化学实体分类错误，在开发集上取得提升但在测试集上未能泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别中相似实体类型（如基因和化学物质）难以区分的问题，提升模型性能。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见误分类，同时探索了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 后处理策略在开发集上将微平均F1分数从0.79提升到0.83，但在盲测集上反而从0.79下降到0.77，表明存在过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 基于词典的细化方法对预训练BioNER模型有潜力，但需解决开发数据过拟合问题，确保在实际应用中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

### [2] [Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592)
*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) 在候选多样性受限时会产生安全漏洞，RefDiv攻击方法能有效暴露这一弱点，现有安全防护措施对此类攻击防御有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TTS方法中一个未被认识到的失败模式：当候选响应多样性受限时，即使限制程度不大，TTS产生不安全输出的概率也会显著增加。

Method: 提出RefDiv（参考引导的多样性减少协议）作为诊断攻击方法，通过约束候选响应多样性来压力测试TTS流水线。在四个开源模型和两种TTS策略上进行广泛实验。

Result: 限制多样性一致性地提高了TTS产生不安全结果的比率，这种效应通常比直接使用高对抗意图提示更强。现有安全防护分类器无法检测RefDiv生成的对抗性输入提示。

Conclusion: TTS存在基于多样性的通用安全漏洞，需要设计既能有效又能抵御多样性针对性压力测试的鲁棒TTS策略。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [3] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC架构用于语音抑郁症检测，通过多任务学习和跨层注意力整合多层自监督学习特征，在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音抑郁症检测方法难以提取有意义的特征和捕捉稀疏、异质的抑郁线索，现有方法通常只使用SSL模型的最后一层或寻找单一最佳层，容易过拟合且无法充分利用分层结构。

Method: HAREN-CTC包含两个关键模块：分层自适应聚类模块将SSL特征重组为互补嵌入，跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖关系，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督。

Result: 在标准数据划分和五折交叉验证的泛化设置下，模型在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上分别达到0.81和0.82的macro F1分数，优于先前方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过整合多层SSL特征和CTC对齐感知训练，有效提升了语音抑郁症检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

### [4] [Systematic Diagnosis of Brittle Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08595)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数学推理评估框架，通过分析GPT-3.5在GSM8K数据集上的逐步推理，识别出模型在组合推理等复杂模式上的严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估机器学习模型对数学的真正理解程度，超越标准基准测试，诊断具体的失败点。

Method: 使用GPT-3.5生成结构化逐步推理，然后用GPT-4o-mini分析错误并进行无监督聚类，识别不同的推理模式。

Result: 发现模型表现出非人类化的脆弱性：在顺序计算等程序性模式上表现完美，但在需要组合推理的模式上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 通过量化不同推理技能的可靠性，为评估数学理解和开发更可靠的应用提供了更精细的方法和路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [5] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出置信度分数(CS)作为无参考指标，缓解传统基于流畅度指标对创意文本生成的偏见，实验证明CS在评估创意响应方面更平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无参考指标如自困惑度对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要开发更少偏见的替代方案来公平评估现代LLM的创意生成能力。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布推导置信度分数(CS)，通过在gpt-4o-mini上进行实验，比较CS与传统流畅度指标在99个创意提示上的表现差异。

Result: 实验显示流畅度指标在99个创意提示中偏好新颖响应的比例为0%，而CS偏好新颖响应的比例为19%，差异具有统计显著性(95% CI: [11.1%, 27.3%])。CS还能有效区分简单、中等和困难任务。

Conclusion: 置信度分数缓解了传统指标对创意性的偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供了更平衡的评估方法。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

### [6] [Recover-LoRA: Data-Free Accuracy Recovery of Degraded Language Models via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08600)
*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA是一种轻量级、数据集无关的方法，通过合成数据和logit蒸馏来学习选择性层的LoRA适配器，以恢复因量化、剪枝、序列化等优化导致的模型性能退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化（如量化、剪枝、格式转换、模型导出和序列化）可能导致语言模型任务性能的功能性退化。大多数性能恢复工作集中在鲁棒量化技术上，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的来源（如不当的模型序列化）恢复模型精度。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏来学习选择性层的LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小型语言模型（包括MHA和GQA注意力架构）上，Recover-LoRA将模型精度恢复了5-17%。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA是一种有效的轻量级方法，能够从各种模型权重退化源中恢复模型精度，适用于不同注意力架构的小型语言模型。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

### [7] [Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601)
*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一种受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的大语言模型设计，通过图结构存储、记忆过滤和概率召回机制，在纵向医疗对话中显著提升了记忆能力和响应真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆系统要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，无法在资源受限的边缘设备上有效处理长期记忆，特别是在医疗等需要长期跟踪用户状态的场景中。

Method: 采用图结构存储，包含模块化内容和冗余过滤器、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及基于时间衰减和刷新过程的概率召回机制，还引入了从记忆图中高效提取的"核心摘要"来捕捉用户个性和长期细节。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话实验中，Mnemosyne在盲测人类评估中获得65.8%的胜率，显著优于基线RAG的31.1%；在LoCoMo基准测试中，在时间推理和单跳检索方面达到最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二，优于Mem0和OpenAI等常用方法。

Conclusion: Mnemosyne证明了通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以显著改善事实回忆、增强时间推理能力，并产生更自然的用户响应，特别适用于纵向医疗助手等需要长期记忆的应用场景。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

### [8] [Human Texts Are Outliers: Detecting LLM-generated Texts via Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08602)
*Cong Zeng,Shengkun Tang,Yuanzhou Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Wenchao Yu,Xujiang Zhao,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将AI文本检测任务重新定义为离群检测问题，将人类文本视为分布外样本，机器生成文本视为分布内样本，使用单类学习和基于分数的方法实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI文本检测方法将任务视为二元分类问题，但人类文本并不构成统一分布，导致模型记忆OOD特征而非学习'非ID'行为本质，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 使用单类学习方法（DeepSVDD和HRN）和基于分数的学习技术（如基于能量的方法），构建离群检测框架。

Result: 在DeepFake数据集上达到98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，FPR95仅为8.9%。在多语言、受攻击、未见模型和领域文本设置下均表现出鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为OOD检测问题能显著提升检测性能，特别是在面对多样化人类文本时具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

*Deshui Yu,Yizhi Wang,Saihui Jin,Taojie Zhu,Fanyi Zeng,Wen Qian,Zirui Huang,Jingli Ouyang,Jiameng Li,Zhen Song,Tian Guan,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: YpathRAG是一个面向病理学的RAG框架，通过双通道混合检索和证据判断模块，显著提升了病理学领域的检索质量和事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在病理学等高门槛领域仍存在幻觉问题，现有方法依赖领域微调但无法扩展知识边界或实施证据约束。

Method: 构建包含28个子领域153万段落的病理学向量数据库，采用BGE-M3密集检索与词汇引导稀疏检索的双通道混合检索，以及基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块。

Result: 在YpathR基准上Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M基准上，通用和医疗LLM准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了检索质量和事实可靠性，为面向病理学的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

### [10] [LatentBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Latent Space Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08604)
*Raffaele Mura,Giorgio Piras,Kamilė Lukošiūtė,Maura Pintor,Amin Karbasi,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LatentBreak攻击方法，通过语义替换生成低困惑度的对抗性提示，能够绕过基于困惑度的防御机制，在多个安全对齐模型上优于现有攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击通常通过添加高困惑度的对抗后缀或长模板来解锁模型响应，但这些攻击容易被基于困惑度的简单过滤检测到。

Method: LatentBreak采用白盒攻击，通过将输入提示中的单词替换为语义等效的词，最小化对抗提示与无害请求在潜在空间中的距离，从而生成自然且低困惑度的对抗性提示。

Result: 评估显示LatentBreak生成的提示更短且困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上能够有效绕过基于困惑度的过滤器，优于其他越狱算法。

Conclusion: LatentBreak证明了通过语义替换生成低困惑度对抗提示的有效性，为绕过基于困惑度的防御机制提供了新方法。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了数字平台上错误信息的对抗性攻击，特别是语言切换、查询长度膨胀和结构重构等变换方式，并提出了一个多语言、多智能体的大语言模型框架，可作为网页插件部署到在线平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台上错误信息的快速传播威胁公共话语、情感稳定和决策制定。虽然先前工作探索了错误信息检测中的各种对抗性攻击，但本文研究的特定变换尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 开发了一个多语言、多智能体的大语言模型框架，结合检索增强生成技术，可部署为在线平台的网页插件。研究了跨英语、法语、西班牙语、阿拉伯语、印地语和中文的语言切换及翻译，查询长度膨胀后的摘要生成，以及重构为选择题的结构变换。

Result: 展示了基于插件部署的可行性，为现实世界网页应用提供了解决方案。

Conclusion: 强调了AI驱动的错误信息检测在保护在线事实完整性免受多样化攻击方面的重要性，同时展示了插件部署在现实世界网页应用中的可行性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于情感热点的统一模型，通过检测文本、音频和视频中的情感热点，使用热点门控融合和路由混合对齐器来改善多模态情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的情感识别具有挑战性，因为判别性证据稀疏、局部化且跨模态异步。现有方法难以有效处理这些特征。

Method: 检测每个话语在文本、音频和视频中的情感热点，通过热点门控融合将热点与全局特征融合，使用路由混合对齐器对齐模态，并通过跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中表现优于强基线模型，消融实验证实了热点门控融合和混合对齐器的贡献。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明热点中心视角可以为未来多模态学习提供信息，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA是一个评估大语言模型在亚洲文化背景下文化意识的综合框架，包含多语言多模态对齐的基准数据集和五维评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在非西方、低资源环境下的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要专门评估其在亚洲文化背景下的表现。

Method: 构建包含27,000个问题的多语言多模态基准数据集，覆盖8个亚洲国家和10种语言；提出五维评估协议和文化意识接地验证模块；使用比较模型分析、注意力追踪和视觉消融前缀重放方法。

Result: 创建了首个在文本、图像和语音三个模态输入对齐的数据集，79%的问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建文化可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了可操作的见解，揭示了模型在不同语言和模态间的差异原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct

innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost是一个统一框架，将神经元激活及其信号传播表示为图，用于解释LLMs如何从序列输入中捕获结构语义并通过结构一致机制生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。需要理解LLMs如何捕获结构语义并生成输出。

Method: 引入GraphGhost框架，将神经元激活和信号传播建模为图，使用PageRank等图算法分析LLMs特性，并通过结构干预评估关键神经元节点。

Result: 揭示了跨不同数据集的共享和模型特定的推理行为，证明对关键神经元节点的编辑会触发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预和最终理解LLMs推理结构基础的有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中对患者性别相关性的判断存在显著不一致性，特别是在性别相关性判断方面，这可能影响LLM在临床实践中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用前景广阔，但其对偏见的敏感性令人担忧。性别长期以来影响医生行为和患者结果，因此需要评估LLM在扮演类似人类角色时是否会复制或放大性别相关偏见。

Method: 使用《新英格兰医学杂志挑战赛》的案例研究，为多个开源和专有LLM分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估它们在LLM性别分配下的响应一致性，包括基于LLM的诊断以及模型对患者性别临床相关性或必要性的判断。

Result: 大多数模型的诊断在不同LLM性别下相对一致。但在患者性别相关性和必要性判断方面，所有模型都表现出显著的不一致性，特别是在相关性判断方面。某些模型在解释患者性别时甚至显示出系统性的女性-男性差异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了一种未被充分探索的偏见，可能削弱LLM在临床实践中的可靠性，强调在与LLM交互时需要常规检查身份分配一致性，以确保可靠和公平的AI支持临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用LLMs自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，保持原问题解不变，减少人工标注成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，缺乏有干扰条件的问题。现有干扰条件数据集难度低、表达不自然，且添加干扰条件后需要大量人工检查答案，限制了可靠评测

Method: 设计迭代框架，使用LLMs从多个角度和认知层次修订数学应用题，生成有意义的干扰条件，同时明确指导LLMs保持原问题解不变

Result: 框架高效易部署，显著减少了生成含干扰条件数学应用题的工作量，同时保持高质量数据

Conclusion: 该框架为评估LLMs在复杂数学推理场景下的表现提供了更可靠的基准，解决了现有数据集的局限性

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过重新评估模型在基准问题的改写版本上的表现，发现LLMs在改写问题上的准确性显著下降，表明基准分数可能因记忆测试项目而虚高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型基准分数是否因记忆测试项目或近似重复项而虚高，验证模型是否真正理解问题而非依赖表面形式捷径。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上，通过生成改写版本的问题并比较原始问题与改写问题的准确性差异。

Result: 改写问题导致准确性显著下降（原始vs改写），与先前关于污染和脆弱表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准分数确实可能因记忆而虚高，模型表现对问题表面形式敏感，表明需要更严格的评估协议来测试真实泛化能力。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心化语言模型，采用上扩增策略从英语模型扩展参数空间来整合泰语知识，避免了现有方法导致的知识侵蚀问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型通常基于开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法可能在注入泰语知识时侵蚀模型的原有知识，因为优化参数可能与新语言需求冲突。

Method: 从较小的高性能英语开源LLM开始，扩展其参数空间，利用新增容量系统整合泰语知识。预训练使用1.5万亿token（含3000亿泰语token），后训练阶段使用60万指令示例进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心化基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）上表现优于Typhoon2-70B模型。

Conclusion: 上扩增和知识整合框架有效，既保留了原始模型的通用智能，又建立了独特的架构，支持未来的可扩展增强。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Motivation: 随着智能对话模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟器研究来调整有效的对话策略，特别是在销售导向的对话系统中。

Method: 引入基于用户职业的轻量级条件策略，引导代理优先选择与用户偏好一致的对话意图。

Result: 职业条件策略产生了更短且更成功的对话，年龄和性别影响整体性能，但职业对对话意图差异影响最显著。

Conclusion: 丰富的模拟器用户画像很重要，简单的基于人物特征的策略可以显著提升销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Text2Stories任务和指标，用于量化需求（用户故事）与利益相关者实际需求的匹配程度，包括正确性和完整性两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否真实反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工任务。

Method: 将访谈记录分段为文本块，将对齐问题实例化为文本块与用户故事之间的匹配问题，使用基于LLM的匹配器进行实验。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验显示，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏F1分数，而仅使用嵌入模型效果较差但可用于有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories指标能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成vs自动生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、源可信的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动化优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升了从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、频繁产生幻觉，以及当模式包含模糊或不完整规范时代理行为不可靠

Method: 开发PARSE系统，包含ARCHITECT组件（自主优化JSON模式）和SCOPE组件（基于反射的提取方法，结合静态和LLM防护机制）

Result: 在三个数据集上评估，在SWDE上提取准确率提升64.7%，整体框架改进达到10%，首次重试减少92%的提取错误，同时保持实用延迟

Conclusion: PARSE通过将JSON模式视为可解释和改进的自然语言理解合约，显著改善了结构化信息提取的性能和可靠性

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现评估导向的提示会夸大LLM性能，导致更长的推理链和格式合规性提升，但实际能力提升有限，建议采用中性措辞和双重框架检查来确保基准测试反映真实部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试使用评估导向的提示（如要求显式推理和严格格式），而实际部署需要简洁、契约约束的回答，这种"评估气味"可能夸大性能测量而无法反映真实能力。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型进行六组A/B测试，固定任务内容和解码，变化框架（评估导向vs真实世界）和推理深度，涵盖数学、代码修复、引用生成、激励翻转、推理链可见性和多语言场景，使用确定性验证器计算准确性、合规性等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加推理链长度（数百到1000+字符），降低仅回答合规性，准确性提升有限或不一致；在结构化输出中改善格式包装但未提升实质内容；激励措辞改变错误构成，谨慎激励在高推理时略微提升准确性，能力激励产生更简洁但风险更高的输出；乌尔都语标题重现这些模式。

Conclusion: 评估导向提示会夸大性能测量，建议采用中性措辞、双重框架检查、契约感知评分、风格差异报告、置信度治理和多语言仪表板，确保基准测试收益反映可部署能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

TL;DR: PULSE框架使用小型语言模型生成的rationales作为监督信号，结合用户交互历史，在Thought Space中联合建模用户行为及其语义驱动因素，解决了LLM推理成本高和SLM推理能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推荐系统中推理能力强但推理成本高，小型语言模型效率高但推理能力未被充分探索。现有系统未能充分利用自然语言rationales作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的rationales作为直接学习信号，与用户交互历史一起监督，在Thought Space中联合建模用户行为（what）和语义驱动因素（why）。

Result: PULSE在多个基准数据集上优于领先的ID、协同过滤和基于LLM的顺序推荐模型，在跨域推荐中表现出更好的可迁移性，并在推理导向问答等下游任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将rationales作为一等信号处理，产生了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入，为高效且有效的推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

TL;DR: ExPO-HM提出了一种新的仇恨表情包检测方法，通过结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵奖励，在检测精度、细粒度分类和推理质量方面都达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，只能提供二元预测，缺乏上下文和解释。而现有的解释-检测方法性能不如简单SFT基线，主要问题是模型未能假设政策相关的线索（如目标和攻击类型），且二元奖励信号不足以指导推理。

Method: ExPO-HM结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵（CDE）作为推理质量的度量和奖励，灵感来源于人类标注者的训练和评估过程。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面都达到了最先进性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线分别提升了15%和17%的F1分数。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单的二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供了准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

TL;DR: HDLM是一种新型的离散扩散语言模型，通过分层词汇表实现从粗粒度到细粒度的语义生成过程，在文本生成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在生成过程中缺乏层次化的语义控制，HDLM旨在通过分层扩散过程实现更可控和高效的文本生成。

Method: 构建分层词汇表，前向过程将细粒度token扰动为粗粒度祖先token，反向过程逐步预测更详细的语义，实现时间变化的语义尺度预测。

Result: HDLM在文本生成实验中验证了有效性，相比基线模型展现出更低的验证困惑度和生成困惑度。

Conclusion: HDLM为语言建模提供了一个通用的分层扩散框架，能够灵活实现并超越现有方法，在文本生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

TL;DR: UCoT是一种高效的推理框架，通过前期思想嵌入实现CoT压缩，使用小型模型作为压缩器生成富含推理信息的嵌入，大型模型作为执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理，在保持强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链式思维(CoT)虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但由于自回归特性导致计算成本高、延迟大。现有CoT压缩方法要么需要繁琐的离散提示设计，要么构建外部压缩数据集但牺牲关键推理细节。

Method: UCoT采用协作工作流：第一阶段训练小型压缩器生成富含推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化大型执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理，使用奖励机制确保正确性。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的token使用量减少50%，性能比最先进方法高出3.08%，同时保持强大的推理能力。

Conclusion: UCoT通过自动化CoT压缩有效解决了长CoT推理效率问题，在显著减少输出长度的同时维持甚至提升推理性能，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

Motivation: 个人叙事是作者构建意义的重要方式，风格对传达主观体验至关重要，但目前缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析序列模式。

Result: 应用于数百个梦境叙事，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 语言选择模式与心理状态之间存在明确关系，该框架为系统分析个人叙事风格提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 该研究利用LLM处理定性文本数据，结合传统评分量表创建增强测试，在抑郁症评估中显著提高了测量精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估主要依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息，需要一种方法来整合定性数据。

Method: 开发了一个结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的新概念框架，在真实世界样本(n=693)和合成数据集(n=3,000)上进行评估，基于项目信息计算经验性地选择最有信息的LLM评分指令。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计显著改进，LLM项目的信息增益相当于在原19项测试中增加6.3-16.0个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的方法来利用转录文本增强传统心理测量工具，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效可扩展的扩散大语言模型推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现显著加速，比现有系统快10倍，甚至比优化后的自回归模型快2-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案具有并行生成优势，但缺乏标准化高效的推理框架限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件（模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略、KV缓存管理器），结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval达到1100+ tokens/秒，六个基准测试平均800+ tokens/秒；比Fast-dLLM快10倍，比优化后的QWen2.5-3B快2-3倍。

Conclusion: dInfer为扩散大语言模型提供了高效推理解决方案，通过算法创新和系统优化实现了显著性能提升，推动了dLLM的广泛应用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首次对代码LLM的缩放定律进行大规模实证研究，发现代码比自然语言更数据饥渴，需要更高的数据-参数比，且Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言存在严格语法等根本差异，不清楚这些定律是否直接适用于代码LLM。

Method: 进行117次实验，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合Chinchilla定律和Farseer定律，并进行代码-自然语言混合实验。

Result: 代码LLM能有效随模型规模扩展，但代码是更数据饥渴的体系，需要比自然语言高得多的数据-参数比；Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确；资源受限时自然语言有益，但高计算预算时成为不利因素。

Conclusion: 代码LLM的缩放定律与自然语言不同，需要专门针对代码的缩放指导，特别是在数据需求和模型规模扩展方面。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三阶段推理框架来评估大语言模型在法律案例推理中的表现，发现模型在表层推理表现良好，但在层次推理和综合分析任务中性能显著下降，且错误回答消耗更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 案例推理是美国法律实践的核心，需要专业人士通过类比和区分先例来论证当前案例。虽然大语言模型展现出强大能力，但在这个复杂、微妙的推理形式中的熟练度仍需进一步研究。

Method: 提出了一个正式框架，将识别案例间显著区别的过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用称为因素的事实谓词建模案例，将其组织到法律知识层次结构中，并定义可验证的规则来识别区别、分析其论证支持并评估其重要性。

Result: 评估显示模型在表层推理（任务1）达到高准确率，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）中性能下降。最显著的是，模型在错误回答上比正确回答消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂领域中大语言模型推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法学，并揭示了构建稳健可信赖法律AI必须解决的基本限制。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准存在计算成本高、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误而非罕见关键故障的问题，需要找到最小错误代码集来表示整个错误空间以及最小测试用例集来区分它们。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二进制代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基础，矩阵的秩指定了独立错误模式的最小数量，并提出了WrongSelect算法来选择最大多样性的错误代码。

Result: 构建了TC-Bench基准，实验显示即使最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗分数膨胀的基准，显著提高了对测试用例生成方法诊断能力的评估效果。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Luoberta/TC-Bench and our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中全基准测试时间成本过高的问题，评估微基准测试能否像完整基准测试一样一致地排名模型。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准测试在不同模型性能差异下的排名一致性，比较不同样本选择方法的效果。

Result: 发现现有微基准测试方法无法一致地排名MMLU-Pro上3.5分差异或BIG-bench Hard上4分差异的模型对，需要250个样本才能可靠比较相似性能模型。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要更多样本才能保证排名一致性，为微基准测试用户和开发者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Motivation: 地理编码是将位置引用链接到实际地理位置的任务，对非结构化文本的下游分析至关重要。本文探索组合位置引用地理编码这一具有挑战性的场景。

Method: 基于LLM对地理空间数据的推理能力评估，提出基于LLM的组合位置引用地理编码策略，使用相对较小的微调LLM。

Result: 该方法提高了地理编码任务的性能，较小的微调LLM能够与更大的现成模型达到可比性能。

Conclusion: LLM在地理编码任务中展现出强大的潜力，通过适当的策略和微调，小型模型也能实现与大型模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要理解和保护其多语言响应，确保在不同语言和文化背景下的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和法官LLM，评估模型在五个维度上的多语言响应表现。

Result: GPT-5在各项类别中平均表现最佳，特别是在同意与自主权、伤害预防与安全类别中得分最高（3.56和4.73），而Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最差（1.39和1.98）。

Conclusion: 需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并改进这些领域的表现。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention机制，通过概率性、分层token选择在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，解决Transformer注意力O(n²)复杂度问题，保持95%性能的同时减少35-45%内存消耗并提升1.8倍吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制随序列长度呈二次方增长(O(n²))，限制了长上下文应用，需要一种高效的token选择方法来降低计算和内存开销。

Method: 使用Bernoulli门通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛进行训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，实现可微分且可直接替代标准编码器的token选择机制。

Result: 在分类、抽取式问答和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token即可保持≥95%的全模型性能，峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提升最高约1.8倍。

Conclusion: Adaptive Retention提供了一种架构无关的实用长上下文效率解决方案，无需修改基础注意力机制或任务头。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Conclusion: CCMOR基准有效揭示了LLM在中文常识推理中的不足，检索增强是提升性能的有效策略，为中文LLM评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Motivation: 科学编程任务需要严谨的算法、深度领域知识和特定推理，传统方法难以处理需要分解为子问题的复杂科学工作流。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含专门设计的智能体进行自我反思、创建推理、编码和调试，使用学生-教师范式，结合统一上下文窗口(CCW)减少幻觉。

Result: 在科学编程基准测试中，MOSAIC在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架能有效解决复杂的科学编程任务，通过智能体协作和上下文管理提升科学代码生成的质量。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多语言应用中处理敏感数据，但其规模和语言变异性带来重大隐私风险，目前主要针对英语评估，需要研究语言结构对隐私泄露的影响。

Method: 量化六个语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取、反事实记忆和成员推断，基于英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语医疗语料库训练的LLMs。

Result: 隐私漏洞与语言冗余和分词粒度成正比：意大利语泄露最强，英语成员分离性更高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂性更抗攻击。

Conclusion: 首次提供量化证据表明语言在隐私泄露中起重要作用，强调在LLM部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

TL;DR: 提出Search-on-Graph框架，通过单一搜索函数让LLM在知识图谱上进行迭代导航，解决多跳问答问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多跳知识密集型问题上不可靠，存在长尾事实缺失、幻觉和知识滞后问题；现有KGQA方法在查询编译、子图检索和搜索空间扩展方面存在根本性权衡。

Method: 采用"观察-导航"原则的迭代图导航框架，LLM在每一步检查当前实体的可用关系后再决定下一跳，通过自适应过滤处理高度节点，无需预规划路径或检索大子图。

Result: 在Freebase和Wikidata的六个KGQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在Wikidata基准上比之前最佳方法提升16%，在Freebase基准上也有持续改进。

Conclusion: SoG框架简单有效，无需微调即可适应不同KG模式，通过迭代知情图导航显著提升多跳问答性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，且对话模式与模型脆弱性之间的关系研究不足。

Method: PE-CoA框架包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建多轮越狱攻击。

Result: 在12个LLM和10个危害类别上实现了最先进的攻击性能，发现模型具有不同的脆弱性特征，对一种对话模式的鲁棒性不能推广到其他模式，且模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

### [42] [Quality Estimation Reranking for Document-Level Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08870)
*Krzysztof Mrozinski,Minji Kang,Ahmed Khota,Vincent Michael Sutanto,Giovanni Gatti De Giacomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了质量估计重排序在文档级机器翻译中的应用，发现使用SLIDE和GEMBA-DA等质量评估指标能显著提升翻译质量，特别是在使用更多候选翻译时效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，本文旨在探索其在文档级翻译中的表现。

Method: 使用各种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量评估指标（如SLIDE和GEMBA-DA），在文档级翻译任务中对生成的翻译候选进行评分和选择。

Result: 使用最佳学习型指标SLIDE时，BLEURT-20分数在2个候选翻译时提升+2.00，在32个候选时提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，分别提升+1.63和+4.30。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，能以最小的运行时开销显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个面向财务审计任务的基准测试，评估LLMs在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力，包含语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性三个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使财务审计难以自动化验证，而LLMs在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于真实US-GAAP合规的XBRL文件构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务：FinSM（语义一致性）、FinRE（关系一致性）和FinMR（数值一致性），并提出统一的评估框架。

Result: 对13个最先进LLMs的零样本实验显示，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，在处理分层多文档结构时准确率下降60-90%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代LLMs在基于分类法的财务推理中的系统性局限，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知且符合监管的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 现有方法通常限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段明确促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 在采样过程中为不同token类型应用不同的温度设置：对推理token使用较高温度以鼓励探索，对知识token使用较低温度以保持事实正确性。系统研究了多种多温度调度策略及其在强化学习中的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过为不同token类型应用差异化温度设置，在强化学习框架中有效提升了语言模型的推理能力，同时保持了知识准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC)方法，通过直接选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免了传统基于自编码任务的上下文压缩方法存在的任务不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前上下文压缩方法主要依赖自编码任务训练与上下文无关的压缩token，但这种方法存在根本性不匹配：模型被优化用于重建任务，这与实际下游任务不同，削弱了对实际使用更有益的特征。

Method: SAC直接从原始上下文中选择锚点token，并将上下文信息聚合到其键值(KV)表示中。包含两个关键设计：(1) 锚点嵌入使压缩器能够识别关键token；(2) 双向注意力修改允许锚点token捕获整个上下文的信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SAC在各种压缩比下始终优于现有上下文压缩方法。在MRQA的分布外评估中，SAC在5倍压缩下比强基线提高1个EM分数，在更高压缩比下优势更加明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过直接利用锚点token的架构设计，消除了自编码训练的需求，在上下文压缩任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM内部表示中类似人类印象和刻板印象的人工印象模式，使用刻板印象内容模型进行线性解码分析，发现这些印象能预测模型回答质量和模糊语使用，并探讨了提示内容特征对印象的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM内部表示中是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的模式，以及这些人工印象如何影响模型的下游行为表现。

Method: 使用刻板印象内容模型(SCM)的二维框架，在LLM生成的提示上拟合线性探针来预测印象，分析隐藏表示中的线性可解码性，并研究提示内容、风格和方言特征对印象的影响。

Result: 发现LLM在提示时不一致地报告印象，但从隐藏表示中能更一致地线性解码印象；人工印象能预测回答质量和模糊语使用；特定内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM印象。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些印象与模型行为相关，提示特征会影响印象形成，为理解LLM社会偏见提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估LLMs的指令遵循和决策能力，但在涉及复杂标准操作流程的业务场景中，LLMs的能力评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实业务数据构建SOP-Maze基准，将任务分为横向根系统（宽选项任务）和心根系统（深度逻辑推理任务）两类。

Result: 几乎所有最先进的模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三个关键错误类别：路径盲区、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进模型在复杂业务流程中的能力提供了新见解，并开源了相关工作。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Motivation: 研究开源社区如何通过版本控制的治理文档描述参与和控制机制，为评估AI工作流是否集中或重新分配权力提供基线。

Method: 使用710个项目的配对快照，将文本解析为参与者、规则、行动和对象，通过熵、丰富度和Jensen-Shannon散度测量变化。

Result: 项目随时间定义了更多角色和行动，分布更加均匀，而规则组成保持稳定。治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而增长。

Conclusion: 治理在扩展参与类别的同时保持规则稳定性，为评估AI工作流对权力分配的影响提供了可复现的基线。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的RLVR方法采用静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的变化，导致训练在不同难度级别上失衡，阻碍整体性能提升。

Method: 提出DARO方法，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献，解决损失尺度问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线，收敛速度更快且最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态难度感知的权重调整机制，有效解决了RLVR训练中的损失尺度不平衡问题，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

TL;DR: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, serving as cost-efficient safety patches that decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment is crucial for trustworthy AI but challenging to implement without degrading general performance. Current methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions, incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: Using LoRA-based Refusal-training trained solely on safety data, which effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space.

Result: Demonstrates that LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches that enhance safety without interfering with inherent capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA-based approach provides a practical solution for safety alignment that preserves model performance while being computationally efficient and easily deployable.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的Text-to-SQL方法依赖专有模型，存在部署可行性和数据隐私问题，需要开发更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 包含两个组件：(1)模式检索器使用预计算模式嵌入的向量数据库进行高效模式链接；(2)SQL生成器采用两阶段微调：监督微调后接执行引导的强化学习，实现自我修正而无需昂贵的多候选生成。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%，性能与LLM方法相当或更优，但参数数量减少2倍到30倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用轻量模型可以实现高质量的Text-to-SQL生成，为隐私敏感和资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源印地语系语言Chakma构建了首个经过人工验证的孟加拉语转写Chakma语料库，并通过微调多语言Transformer模型在掩码语言建模任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为一种印地语系语言，由于可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性严重不足。研究旨在解决这一低资源语言的处理问题。

Method: 从Chakma文学作品中收集语料，经母语者验证后构建孟加拉语转写的Chakma语料库。使用该数据集对6种编码器型多语言Transformer模型进行掩码语言建模任务的微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在处理孟加拉语转写的Chakma时表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 研究表明孟加拉语转写的Chakma对于该语言的迁移学习非常有效，并发布了手动验证的单语数据集以促进低资源语言的多语言建模研究。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs无法通过内部状态可靠地区分事实和幻觉，因为基于主体知识的幻觉与正确回答使用相同的内部召回过程，而脱离主体知识的幻觉才能被检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs内部表示是否能可靠区分事实和幻觉输出，因为虽然LLMs编码事实性信号，但也会产生基于捷径或虚假关联的幻觉。

Method: 对LLMs处理事实查询进行机制分析，比较基于主体知识依赖程度的两种幻觉类型，分析隐藏状态几何结构。

Result: 基于主体知识的幻觉与正确回答具有重叠且不可区分的隐藏状态几何结构，而脱离主体知识的幻觉产生可检测的聚类表示。

Conclusion: LLMs内部状态不编码真实性，只编码知识召回模式，表明LLMs实际上不知道它们不知道什么。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct，一个多语言乌尔都语-英语模型，通过改进的自指导技术生成高质量合成数据集，在低预算下显著提升乌尔都语任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发大语言模型面临的挑战：高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有方法通过翻译大量数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术生成高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本地链式推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B等领先多语言LLM，训练预算低于100美元。

Conclusion: 通过改进的自指导方法，可以高效开发高性能、文化对齐的低资源语言LLM，证明了在有限预算下实现高质量多语言模型的可能性。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne是一个训练框架，通过监督微调和GRPO结合，提升推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，而不仅仅是准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链思维推理研究过于关注准确性和效率，忽视了可信赖性的关键方面。可用的推理系统必须具有可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型：生成结构化标签化推理轨迹，显式披露决策信息，提供自我评估的置信度。

Result: 在Qwen3模型上实验显示：推理轨迹清晰度提升44.0%，忠实性提升18.8%，可靠性提升42.4%。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应关注可信赖性的更广泛维度，这是一个被忽视但重要的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于因果语言模型(CLM)的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程获取框架嵌入表示，结合上下文学习和深度度量学习提升性能，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型(CLM)在多种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。研究者希望探索CLM在此任务上的潜力，特别是对于框架资源匮乏的语言如日语。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1) 使用提示工程让CLM输出代表给定情境的框架名称标签；2) 结合上下文学习(ICL)和深度度量学习(DML)获取更适合框架归纳的嵌入表示；3) 对得到的嵌入进行聚类完成框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的框架归纳方法。特别是对于日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: CLM在语义框架归纳任务上具有强大潜力，FrameEOL方法为框架资源匮乏的语言提供了有效的解决方案，仅需少量示例即可获得良好性能。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速变化的信息和领域特定查询。RAG通过结合外部检索机制来解决这一限制，让LLM能够访问最新和上下文相关的知识。

Method: 通过综述分析RAG的整体目标、核心组件、关键挑战和局限性，展示RAG与LLM结合的应用场景。

Result: 识别了RAG框架中的关键弱点，展示了在LLM单独表现不足但结合RAG能显著提升效果的多个应用场景。

Conclusion: RAG仍然是增强LLM能力的重要技术，需要重新思考其角色并开发下一代RAG系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译基准主要依赖表层指标，无法准确评估网络小说翻译的特点，需要专门针对该领域的评估框架。

Method: 构建DITING评估框架，包含成语翻译、词义消歧、术语本地化、时态一致性、零代词解析和文化安全六个维度，包含18K专家标注的中英句子对。提出AgentEval多智能体评估框架和MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 评估了14个开源、闭源和商业模型，发现中文训练的LLM表现优于更大的国外模型，DeepSeek-V3在忠实度和风格一致性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 为基于LLM的网络小说翻译研究建立了新范式，提供了公开资源推动未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Motivation: 期望通过思考话语增强的数据训练的'个性LLM'能更好地模仿说话者的个性特征。

Method: 使用思考话语增强对话数据训练LLM，并基于大五人格框架评估模型性能。

Result: 使用思考话语增强数据训练的LLM在宜人性和神经质两个维度上更接近说话者的真实人格特征。

Conclusion: 思考话语增强能提升LLM模拟个体个性的能力，且增强质量影响模型性能。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本去标识化方法难以评估其实际保护效果，需要更强的重标识攻击来测试去标识化技术的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 分析PII跨度重标识顺序的重要性，通过聚合多个顺序的预测来改进结果；2. 使用推理模型提升重标识性能，特别是在攻击者拥有广泛背景知识的情况下。

Result: 提出的两种策略能够构建更强的重标识攻击，有效评估去标识化方法的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多顺序预测聚合和推理模型是评估文本去标识化鲁棒性的有效方法，特别是在攻击者具备丰富背景知识时表现更佳。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译增强方法，通过指令模型和层选择性调优，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，而专门优化的翻译模型又缺乏推理能力。需要一种方法能同时兼顾推理和翻译性能。

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据对特定层进行选择性调优，提出了Qwen3-XPlus模型。

Result: 在高低资源语言翻译上都取得显著提升，低资源语言如斯瓦希里语达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet。仅用少量平行数据就在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，同时在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂度并提高了更多语言的可访问性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理过程而忽视详细的输出格式要求，而通过监督数据集进行微调成本高昂且参数访问受限。

Method: DICE采用两阶段方法构建结构化链式思维适应数据集，并通过双重调优策略微调小语言模型，以分析-回答模式生成结构化输出。

Result: 实验表明DICE将大语言模型输出的格式准确率和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保留大语言模型广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，提供了一种高效的结构化输出优化方案。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Motivation: 传统因果发现方法面临数据收集成本高、对已知关系重复计算、假设不现实等挑战，而现有的LLM方法只能发现已知关系，无法揭示新的因果关系。

Method: IRIS采用混合方法，结合统计算法和LLM方法，通过迭代检索和集成系统自动收集相关文档、提取变量，并包含缺失变量提议组件来扩展因果图。

Result: 该框架能够从初始变量集出发，实现实时因果发现，无需预先存在的数据集，并能发现已知和新的因果关系。

Conclusion: IRIS解决了传统因果发现方法的局限性，提供了一个能够发现新颖因果关系的实时发现框架。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Self-Critique方法，专门用于检测LLM在强化学习后训练阶段的数据污染问题，通过检测模型输出熵分布的崩溃来识别污染样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着强化学习后训练在提升LLM推理能力中变得日益重要，当前缺乏针对该阶段的数据污染检测方法，这构成了关键的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出Self-Critique方法，基于观察到RL后训练会导致LLM输出熵分布崩溃为特定稀疏模式的特性，通过探测底层策略崩溃来检测数据污染。同时构建了RL-MIA基准来模拟该污染场景。

Result: 实验表明Self-Critique在多个模型和污染任务中显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%，而现有方法在RL阶段污染检测中接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: Self-Critique方法首次使RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测成为可能，填补了该领域的重要研究空白。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: CFVBench是一个大规模多模态检索增强生成基准，包含599个视频和5360个开放QA对，覆盖图表报告、新闻广播等密集格式领域。研究发现当前MLLMs难以捕捉细粒度多模态细节，并提出自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面有限，通常关注单模态或有限模态任务，或粗粒度场景理解。需要更全面的基准来评估模型在检索和生成阶段的能力。

Method: 提出CFVBench基准，包含599个公开视频和5360个手动验证的开放QA对。提出自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架，自适应增加帧采样密度并在必要时选择性调用外部工具。

Result: 系统评估了7种检索方法和14个常用MLLMs，发现当前模型（包括GPT5和Gemini）难以捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节。AVR框架在所有评估的MLLMs中一致提升了细粒度多模态理解和性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度多模态细节的捕捉是当前MLLMs的关键瓶颈，AVR框架通过自适应视觉优化有效缓解了这一问题，为多模态检索增强生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs评估主要依赖静态医学考试基准，高估模型性能且忽略真实临床实践中模糊多变的情况，需要更贴近真实临床实践的动态评估框架。

Method: 提出DyReMe动态基准，生成新鲜咨询式病例，引入鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素等干扰，采用多样化表达风格，评估准确性、真实性、帮助性和一致性四个维度。

Result: 动态评估方法产生更具挑战性和真实性的评估结果，揭示了最先进LLMs与真实临床实践之间的显著不匹配。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为更真实的LLMs医疗诊断评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，标准基于结果的强化学习在多项选择题上存在风险，可能损害推理质量如逻辑一致性，而现有解决方案如大规模过程奖励模型成本过高。

Method: 提出CLARity框架：集成一致性感知奖励机制、两阶段精炼-监控训练流程，以及动态数据重构策略，仅使用小型通用LLM来增强推理一致性。

Result: 实验显示CLARity相比基线方法将响应一致性提升16.5%，准确性提升7.5%。人工评估进一步证实了连贯性和专业性的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使小型模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型，在数据稀缺领域实现高质量训练。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

TL;DR: DualCSE是一种句子嵌入方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，以克服传统单向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法为每个句子只分配单个向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，这些嵌入在共享空间中并存。

Result: 实验结果表明DualCSE能有效编码显式和隐式含义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双向量表示方法成功克服了传统句子嵌入的局限性，能够更好地捕捉句子语义。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

Motivation: LLM预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，掩盖了真实学习动态，这阻碍了LLM研究的进展

Method: MaP框架结合检查点合并（平滑参数空间）和Pass@k指标（提供低方差统计估计），共同应对参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性

Result: 实验表明MaP能产生更平滑的性能曲线、减少运行间方差、确保更一致的模型排名

Conclusion: MaP为观察LLM训练动态提供了更可靠和真实的视角，为LLM研究奠定了关键的经验基础

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成可能限制性能。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成上达到58.5 BLEU-1，在罪名预测上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏F1值。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使是一个小型大语言模型，在高质量领域特定数据上训练后，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个专为扩散大语言模型设计的训练无关缓存淘汰框架，通过掩码查询引导的评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，显著减少KV缓存内存占用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力缓存机制需要大量内存，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存淘汰策略为自回归模型设计，忽视了dLLMs的独特特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: MaskKV包含两个关键创新：1）掩码查询引导的评分机制，利用注意力权重识别并淘汰每个注意力头中不太重要的提示词；2）自适应缓存预算策略，减少中间层的缓存分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的头中。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，将KV缓存压缩至仅256对（少于5%的token），在LongBench上保留了94%的全缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现了高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了dLLMs的缓存内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，为资源受限环境下的长上下文处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法（黑盒或灰盒）对计算失败原因提供有限洞察，需要一种能深入理解推理错误本质的白盒方法。

Method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV)：将正确CoT步骤的归因图视为潜在推理电路的执行轨迹，训练分类器识别这些图的结构特征差异。

Result: (1) 错误的结构特征具有高度预测性；(2) 这些特征具有高度领域特异性；(3) 通过针对性干预能成功纠正模型的错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过审视模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层次因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数庞大难以在资源受限硬件上部署，现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩比会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳。

Method: 提出细粒度低秩压缩器(FLRC)，为每层高效确定最优秩分配，并引入渐进低秩解码机制来维持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC相比最先进的低秩压缩方法在摘要任务上ROUGE-L指标提升高达17%。

Conclusion: FLRC建立了一个更鲁棒高效的框架来改进LLM推理，在压缩率和性能之间取得了更好平衡。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C2C平台上的个人卖家在二手产品定价方面面临挑战，现有静态回归模型泛化性能差且无法捕捉市场动态变化。

Method: LLP框架：1) 检索相似产品；2) 利用LLM理解自由文本中的定价信息；3) 两阶段优化(SFT+GRPO)；4) 置信度过滤机制。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下，静态采用率从40%提升至72%，在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采用率。

Conclusion: LLP框架显著优于现有方法，能很好泛化到未见类别，成功解决了二手产品动态定价的挑战。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: ReTraceQA是一个新的基准测试，通过过程级评估揭示SLMs在常识推理任务中即使给出正确答案，其推理过程也存在缺陷，表明仅关注最终答案的评估方法会高估SLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对小型语言模型(SLMs)的评估主要依赖最终答案的准确性，而忽视了导致这些答案的推理过程的有效性。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试，采用专家标注的数据集，并使用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为自动评判者进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现14-24%的情况下SLMs给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用LLMs进行推理感知评估时，SLMs在所有模型和数据集上的性能显著下降，得分最多降低25%。

Conclusion: 仅比较最终答案与真实答案的评估指标会高估SLMs的能力，需要进行过程级评估以更准确地衡量模型的推理能力。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

Motivation: 大型推理模型通常需要额外训练才能实现长链推理能力，本研究旨在探索是否可以在不训练的情况下激发这种能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit解码时方法，利用logit算术调整目标大模型的输出，使用小推理模型作为指导器；进一步提出ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练指导器模型。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别实现了24.5%和29.1%的相对准确率提升，使用21倍小的指导模型指导Qwen2.5-32B模型。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效且灵活，适用于不同模型家族，与后训练方法正交，为无需昂贵后训练即可解锁大规模模型长推理能力提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

TL;DR: NL2GenSym框架将大语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，通过执行导向的生成器-评判器机制，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，在Water Jug Problem上取得了86%的成功率，并能生成启发式规则大幅提升决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编写规则，过程繁琐；大语言模型具有生成规则的潜力，但现有研究缺乏实验验证。本文旨在填补这一空白，实现从自然语言自动生成符号规则。

Method: 提出NL2GenSym框架，包含基于LLM的生成器（使用RAG访问自演进领域知识库）和评判器，通过执行验证和迭代优化机制生成规则。

Result: 在Water Jug Problem数据集上，框架达到86%以上的规则生成成功率，生成的启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。小参数模型也能获得优于大模型的性能。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym成功实现了从自然语言自动生成符号规则，显著提升了SOAR的实用性，为认知架构与LLM的融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大型医学语言模型中的领域特定微调，发现微调仅修改表示子空间的一小部分，提出调优向量框架来捕捉参数变化方向，并揭示这些向量主要在MLP层写入新方向信息，在注意力头中放大现有方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解领域特定微调如何重塑LLM参数空间的机制，目前主要研究集中在自回归或通用指令模型，领域专业化LLM研究不足。

Method: 提出调优向量框架（受任务向量启发），系统分析医学领域LLM微调，研究参数变化方向和子空间修改。

Result: 微调仅修改小部分表示子空间，调优向量能提升指令遵循和生成质量，跨领域组合调优向量可改善泛化能力，MLP层写入新方向信息，注意力头放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 为LLM适应提供新见解，并提供了分析大型语言模型专业化的通用可解释框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO等方法在链式思维推理中面临稀疏token奖励的挑战，现有的熵正则化方法常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出TEPO框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与token级聚合相结合，实现token级别的优化。

Result: TEPO在关键指标（包括@k和准确率）上持续超越现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新的SOTA，并显著提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO通过token级框架有效解决了GRPO的熵崩溃问题，为LLM推理能力提升提供了新方法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

TL;DR: 本文研究人机交互中的目标共享问题，特别关注数据可视化领域自然语言歧义对代码生成的影响，提出歧义分类体系和量化指标，并通过多轮对话策略减少歧义、提高代码准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人机通信中建立共享目标至关重要，但自然语言歧义会导致看似正确但不符合用户意图的输出。数据可视化领域特别适合研究此问题，因为它包含多种上下文视图（如图表意图和代码实现）。

Method: 开发了歧义类型分类法并提出量化指标；使用DS-1000数据集中的Matplotlib问题验证指标；探索三种语用模型（Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论、问题讨论框架）的多轮对话策略；通过模拟用户研究评估效果。

Result: 提出的歧义指标比不确定性基线更符合人工标注；多轮语用对话能有效减少歧义，显著提高代码准确性，使生成代码更好地匹配用户目标。

Conclusion: 多轮对话在代码生成中具有重要价值，通过语用策略减少歧义可以显著改善人机通信效果，使AI输出更准确地反映用户意图。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多尺度图思维链（MSGCOT）提示框架，将多尺度结构信息融入图提示中，解决了现有单粒度图提示方法忽略图数据多尺度结构信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图提示调优方法局限于单粒度（如节点级或子图级）提示生成，忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级低秩粗化网络来高效捕获多尺度结构特征作为提示生成的层次基向量，并模拟人类从粗到细的认知过程，在每个推理步骤动态整合多尺度信息，形成渐进式的粗到细提示链。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示中能有效提升图提示调优的性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM评估方法需要完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂。需要一种能够在有限标注下高效识别最佳LLM的方法。

Method: 提出主动模型选择框架，自适应选择信息量最大的查询进行标注，并利用基于评判者的标注模型进一步降低成本。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，LLM SELECTOR在选择最佳和接近最佳LLM时，标注成本降低了高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR提供了一种高效且成本效益高的LLM选择方法，显著减少了模型评估所需的标注工作量。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型内部如何表示命名实体，因为实体是文本知识的基本构建块，但现有研究主要关注显式关系，对实体表示本身了解甚少。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLM隐藏状态中一致生成多标记实体提及，扩展logit-lens为Entity Lens来预测多标记提及。

Result: 发现LLM开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多标记实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: LLM具有实体特定的内部表示机制，能够编码和操作多标记实体，这为理解模型内部知识表示提供了新证据。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Motivation: 研究如何有效管理口语对话中的上下文信息，以提升口语对话状态跟踪的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种策略：传统多模态上下文（文本历史+当前口语轮次）、完整口语历史、压缩口语历史（使用注意力池化）。

Result: 在SpokenWOZ语料库上的实验表明，完整口语历史输入在相似规模模型中表现最佳，显著超越先前方法；压缩方法在保持竞争力的准确性的同时减少了上下文大小。

Conclusion: 改进主要源于更有效的上下文利用，完整口语历史和压缩口语历史都是有效的上下文管理策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

Motivation: 针对非英语语言（特别是韩语）资源匮乏的问题，探索使用合成数据构建完全开放的双语大语言模型，为低资源语言环境提供可复现的开发框架。

Method: 从零开始训练10.8B参数的KORMo-10B模型，使用韩英双语语料库，其中68.74%的韩语部分是合成数据，采用平衡语言覆盖和多样化指令风格的精心策划方法。

Result: 模型在推理、知识和指令跟随等广泛基准测试中达到与当代开源多语言基线相当的性能，证明了合成数据可以可靠支持长期预训练而不会导致模型崩溃。

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Conclusion: 该索引系统可作为LLM安全工具，确保之前无法实现的越狱无关LLM安全，并为其他团队的大规模数据索引提供参考，促进向绿色计算的转型。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Method: 使用三段论作为基准测试LLMs的逻辑泛化能力，并提出结合符号推理与神经计算的混合架构。

Result: LLMs在递归性方面表现良好，但在组合性方面存在显著困难。混合架构在保持高效率的同时实现了稳健推理。

Conclusion: 混合模型能有效解决神经推理系统中的关键泛化障碍，为构建可靠的逻辑证明器提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 这是首个关于多模态策略内化的工作，提供了数据集、训练方法和全面评估，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our

*Veronica Rammouz,Aaron Gonzalez,Carlos Cruzportillo,Adrian Tan,Nicole Beebe,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了无标签情况下评估NLP模型跨域性能排名的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比漂移基线和零样本基线产生更准确和一致的排名相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化到新领域时，无需标签的性能估计很重要，但现有方法在跨域排名可靠性方面仍不明确。

Method: 使用四类基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集的15个领域上进行两步评估。

Result: 大语言模型错误预测器在真实准确率排名相关性上表现更强更一致；排名可靠性在领域间性能差异大、错误预测与基础模型真实失败模式一致时更高。

Conclusion: 明确了性能估计方法何时可信，为跨域模型评估提供了使用指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变的ASR框架，通过集成口音分类和频谱图掩蔽数据增强，提高ASR模型对英语和波斯语口音变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练Transformer模型在ASR中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率升高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，掩蔽对预测影响最大的区域，使用掩蔽后的频谱图进行数据增强。

Result: 在Whisper模型上的实验显示，该方法在英语和波斯语设置中均显著降低了词错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了多语言ASR系统对口音和方言多样性的鲁棒性发展，并为低资源语言研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

TL;DR: 提出Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP)方法，通过步骤级监督来平衡推理模型的效率和准确性，解决过度思考问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法在减少推理模型token消耗时往往损害模型性能，这是由于token级监督过于简单。

Method: 设计了GRSP方法，利用推理片段与token消耗和模型性能的强相关性，构建基于片段聚类的长度感知加权机制。

Result: 实验表明GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提升token效率，特别是在困难问题上优势明显，且能稳定强化学习训练并有效扩展到不同模型规模。

Conclusion: 监督的粒度在平衡推理模型效率和准确性中起关键作用，GRSP通过步骤级正则化实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了18个开源LLM在5个下游任务中对拼写错误的鲁棒性，发现错误会降低性能，特别是生成式和推理任务，且不同语言间鲁棒性存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试假设输入干净，但实际应用中用户输入常包含拼写错误，LLM在多语言环境下对拼写错误的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 开发MulTypo算法模拟基于语言特定键盘布局和打字行为的人类拼写错误，评估18个开源LLM在语言推理、多选问答、数学推理和机器翻译等5个任务上的表现。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，生成式和推理任务受影响最严重；指令调优提高干净输入性能但可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒，从英语翻译比翻译成英语更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，通过使用真实对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)因其并行解码能力而成为自回归模型的高效替代品，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好或任务特定奖励的对齐

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比之前基于ELBO或一步估计的方法提供了更准确的近似

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基线方法：GSM8K准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%

Conclusion: SPG方法有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个推理任务上取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

TL;DR: 本文识别了扩散大语言模型中的并行-顺序矛盾，分析了该矛盾对推理能力的影响，并提出了缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然提供高吞吐量和有效顺序推理，但其并行解码与因果推理顺序存在冲突，限制了模型的推理深度和探索广度。

Method: 通过行为分析识别并行-顺序矛盾，引入三个扩展维度（并行、扩散、顺序），并提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现扩散大语言模型仅在直接可判定输出时表现真正并行性，随着任务难度增加会回归自回归行为，并行扩展带来持续改进但扩散和顺序扩展受限于并行-顺序矛盾。

Conclusion: 并行-顺序矛盾是扩散大语言模型的核心限制因素，提出的缓解策略能减少其导致的效果低下和效率问题。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统要么将长视频压缩为粗糙嵌入，要么进行细粒度匹配时成本过高，需要解决多语言医学视频档案中复杂多跳问题的检索挑战。

Method: 将视频字幕分成语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实增强，构建分层树结构，使用语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入，通过粗到细树搜索剪枝无关分支，最后用轻量级LLM对排名靠前的块进行重评分。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上实现了最先进的性能，消融研究证实了知识图谱增强、分层索引和针对性LLM重排序的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型依赖思维链推理来提高任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间思维轨迹本身仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过测量语言合规性、答案准确性和一致性，评估跨语言思维轨迹的一致性，并采用截断和错误注入等扰动技术来探测思维轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 研究发现LRMs具有强烈的语言偏好，不同语言的性能存在差异；思维轨迹的质量和有效性因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对思维轨迹的依赖程度不同。

Conclusion: 多语言思维链推理在不同语言间存在显著差异，需要更深入的研究来理解这些差异，并发布了代码和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 创建包含8,880个刺激项的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估17个不同规模和训练方案的语言模型在新实体推理任务上的表现。

Result: 对语言模型进行推理行为调优能显著提升大多数连接词类型的表现，但所有模型在表达让步意义的连接词上都存在系统性困难。

Conclusion: 研究为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用铺平了道路，揭示了连接词类型对模型性能的重要影响。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI在数学和编程领域表现出色，但在长时程交互任务中表现不佳，需要引入人类认知中的"替代性试错"能力

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段ReSim通过真实环境交互生成结构化推理轨迹；第二阶段Dyna-GRPO使用在线强化学习优化决策

Result: 在Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld基准测试中有效提升了代理的模拟和决策能力

Conclusion: 模拟能力对于AI代理在复杂环境中进行有效推理、规划和行动至关重要

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Conclusion: MPS有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，实现了实时语音模型的高保真推理

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

Motivation: 传统方法需要大量人工标注的推理数据集，成本高昂且资源密集。P-TTS旨在通过少量示例和推理时数据增强来低成本地提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用仅90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统化改变提示强度在推理时合成多样化推理轨迹上下文，然后对Qwen-2.5模型进行微调。

Result: P-TTS-7B和32B模型在AIME2024、AIME2025等数学推理基准上显著超越基线，在AIME'24上分别获得+26.66%和+30.00%的绝对准确率提升。同时增强了在零样本泛化任务上的表现。

Conclusion: P-TTS通过推理时扩展有效探索推理模式的潜在空间，以最小标注成本放大LLM问题解决能力，为资源受限或快速发展的领域提供实用的低成本LLM推理激发方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit

TL;DR: 本文提出EDS框架，通过训练轻量级能量模型在推理时动态干预LLM，降低误拒率同时保持安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全对齐技术过度关注有害提示，导致LLM变得过度谨慎，拒绝回答良性提示，需要同时提升安全性和减少误拒

Method: 训练外部能量模型，在推理时根据LLM内部激活映射能量景观，使用能量函数梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能

Conclusion: EDS为构建低误拒率和高安全性的LLM提供了有效范式

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

### [111] [Inverse-Free Wilson Loops for Transformers: A Practical Diagnostic for Invariance and Order Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08648)
*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个轻量级后处理诊断套件，通过检测Transformer模型内部表示对输入顺序和循环变化的敏感性，来识别模型的不稳定性问题，帮助在部署中预防故障并批准安全优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在实际应用中存在输出不稳定的问题：RAG输出会因段落重排序而翻转，微调会削弱预训练学到的恒定性，推理路径依赖提示顺序，编译器优化会扰动决策边界附近的logits。这些违反预期不变性的故障会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了两种诊断方法：1）基于JVP和Hutchinson探针计算的无逆曲率映射，分析各层和位置的敏感性；2）激活级交换子检测重排序风险。这些信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，输出为阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，以及在部署中控制融合和重排序操作。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量能够在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下共同提升。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareNet是一个基于子图的图神经网络，仅需患者表型数据就能识别最可能的致病基因，为罕见遗传病诊断提供高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大等挑战，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当，特别是在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 使用基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅依赖患者表型数据来识别致病基因，可作为独立方法或与其他候选基因优先排序方法的预处理/后处理过滤器。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂遗传分析，为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的欠服务人群提供了民主化的诊断工具。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种点级方法LD和LCD来处理时间序列预测中的内部实例分布偏移问题，通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入输出分布或预测输出缩放系数来消除内部差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，会导致分布偏移，现有实例归一化技术未能处理单个实例内部的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出两种点级方法：学习分布(LD)通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入输出分布来消除内部差异；学习条件分布(LCD)利用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中使用不同骨干模型评估了两种方法的性能，通过对比实验证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效处理时间序列预测中的内部实例分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对语言赋能基础模型的鲁棒性认证少样本分类器LeFCert，通过双重修剪均值原型和自适应混合机制，在中毒攻击下提供可证明的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言赋能基础模型在少样本学习中依赖开放环境收集的小型支持数据集，容易受到中毒攻击，而现有防御方法缺乏形式化保证且对未知和自适应攻击脆弱。

Method: LeFCert整合文本和特征嵌入，采用自适应混合机制，提出双重修剪均值原型，推导分类分数的可证明上下界。还扩展了LeFCert-L（随机平滑）和LeFCert-C（集体认证）两个变体。

Result: 实验表明LeFCert实现了最先进的性能，在干净准确率和认证准确率上相比现有基线均有显著提升，同时计算效率高，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: LeFCert为语言赋能基础模型的少样本分类提供了首个可证明鲁棒性的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时具备形式化安全保证。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标（归一化应力和KL散度）对尺度变化的敏感性，并提出了一种简单方法使这些指标具有尺度不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会真正改变投影的本质特性，这影响了降维技术评估的准确性。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度对应力和KL散度的影响，提出了一种简单的技术使这两个指标具有尺度不变性。

Result: 研究表明应力和KL散度值会显著受尺度变化影响，而提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中能准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 尺度敏感性会影响降维技术评估，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估可视化投影质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CATS-Linear模型，通过分类辅助通道独立机制动态路由时间序列实例到专用预测器，结合趋势-季节性解耦架构，在固定超参数下达到SOTA精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示线性模型能达到与复杂架构相当的预测性能，但增强线性模型的方法仍待探索。假设不同时间序列实例可能遵循异质线性映射

Method: 使用分类辅助通道独立(CACI)动态路由实例到专用预测器，重新设计趋势-季节性分解架构，添加解耦-线性映射-重耦合框架处理趋势分量，使用复数域线性投影处理季节性分量

Result: 在固定超参数下达到与超参数调优基线相当的SOTA精度，相比固定超参数对应方法提供SOTA精度

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过动态实例路由和重新设计的分解架构，有效提升了线性模型的预测性能

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

TL;DR: DPCformer是一种结合卷积神经网络和自注意力机制的深度学习模型，用于基因组选择，在多种作物性状预测中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因组选择方法在处理复杂性状和大数据集时预测精度不足，需要更有效的模型来捕捉基因型与表型之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用8维one-hot编码处理SNP数据，按染色体排序，采用PMF算法进行特征选择，结合CNN和自注意力机制构建DPCformer模型。

Result: 在5种作物的13个性状上测试，玉米性状预测精度提升最高2.92%，棉花纤维性状提升8.37%，番茄小样本场景PCC提升57.35%，鹰嘴豆产量相关性提升16.62%。

Conclusion: DPCformer在精度、小样本鲁棒性和可解释性方面表现优异，为精准育种和应对全球粮食安全挑战提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，对低频分量直接重用，对高频分量使用二阶Hermite插值预测，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量相似性高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似性差，这促使提出频率感知的缓存策略。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：1) 基于相似性直接重用低频分量特征；2) 使用二阶Hermite插值器预测波动的高频分量；3) 缓存累积残差特征(CRF)而非所有层特征，减少99%内存占用。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit上的广泛实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存通过区分处理不同频率分量的动态特性，有效降低了扩散变换器的推理成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LENS方法改进GRPO算法，通过利用负样本组（无正确答案的组）来提高强化学习效率，在MATH基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRPO算法在负样本组中浪费大量计算资源，因为这些组中无正确答案导致零优势和零梯度，需要找到利用这些负样本组的方法。

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出等价于修改价值函数的策略梯度，该价值函数对错误回答添加置信度加权的惩罚，形成LENS方法。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中使用Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-3B模型，LENS方法持续优于GRPO基线，在更难的项目上获得显著提升。

Conclusion: LENS提供了一种原则性和实用的方法来"拯救"负样本组，提高了RLVR的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于上下文学习(ICL)的均衡器在非平稳时变信道中的适应能力，提出了受经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制设计框架，显著提升了动态环境下的性能和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳时变信道的适应能力。本文旨在探索ICL在非平稳问题中的潜力，特别是时变信道均衡场景。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效的注意力机制，借鉴自适应信号处理算法（如LMS、LRMS）来指导更好的设计，包括多步梯度更新以改善长期跟踪能力。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，受经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制能显著提升动态环境下的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用价值，受自适应算法启发的注意力机制设计为开发具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的下一代无线基础模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 通过将每个实例视为独立类别，鼓励模型学习对变换不变的表示，从而在没有人工标注的情况下获得有意义的特征表示。

Method: 对每个实例应用随机变换生成两个不同视图，然后训练模型将这些视图的表示拉近，同时将不同实例的表示推远。

Result: 模型能够学习到对变换具有不变性的表示，这些表示可以用于下游任务。

Conclusion: 实例判别是一种有效的自监督学习方法，能够通过简单的实例级对比学习获得高质量的表示。

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)方法，通过对称化保护属性干预的符合度分数，在保持边际覆盖性质的同时生成反事实公平的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然点预测器的反事实公平性已有充分研究，但预测集的反事实公平性（在不确定性下进行公平决策的关键）仍未被充分探索。同时，保形预测能提供有效的预测集但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预的符合度分数，开发了CF-CP方法，在保持保形预测的边际覆盖性质的同时确保反事实公平性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，CF-CP在回归和分类任务中都能实现所需的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径来实现反事实公平的不确定性量化。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 本文为语言模型推理时内部状态干预技术提供了理论基础，解释了这些技术如何从Transformer架构的基本计算中产生，并提出了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的原则性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术虽然有效，但通常基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些干预技术提供理论基础。

Method: 基于Dherin等人的研究成果，将理论推广到深度多块Transformer架构，分析用户提示信息在内部的表示和组合方式，推导出将信息压缩为token无关的思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 提出了理论解释现有基于向量和矩阵的模型编辑技术，并提供了将文本输入直接转化为可重用权重更新的计算方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为语言模型内部状态干预提供了理论基础，揭示了文本输入如何通过Transformer计算转化为可重用的权重更新，为模型控制技术提供了更坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable

### [124] [SHAP-Based Supervised Clustering for Sample Classification and the Generalized Waterfall Plot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08737)
*Justin Lin,Julia Fukuyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过聚类SHAP值来解释黑盒模型预测的方法，能够识别样本获得相同预测的不同路径，并在阿尔茨海默病案例中验证了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型在关键应用中缺乏可解释性的问题，使模型预测过程更加透明可信。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化特征贡献度，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，识别样本获得相同预测的不同原因路径，并提出了多分类瀑布图的新泛化方法。

Result: 在模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究中验证了该方法的有效性，能够揭示样本获得相同预测的不同机制。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类是一种有效的可解释AI方法，能够增强对复杂模型预测过程的理解，特别适用于高风险决策场景。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

*Yikai Zhao,Jiekai Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个双方法框架，通过代理模型解释和频谱可预测性分析来解决复杂时间序列集成模型的解释性和可预测性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖AutoML系统生成的复杂集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 使用LightGBM训练代理模型来模仿AutoGluon的预测，实现稳定的SHAP特征归因；2. 集成频谱可预测性分析，通过比较时间序列与纯噪声基准的频谱可预测性来量化预测置信度。

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估显示，更高的频谱可预测性不仅与改进的预测精度强相关，还与代理模型和原始模型之间的更高保真度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时为用户提供了可预测性指标，作为预测及其解释的可靠性指标。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

*Gang Liu,Jie Chen,Yihan Zhu,Michael Sun,Tengfei Luo,Nitesh V Chawla,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DemoDiff是一个基于演示条件的扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例来定义任务上下文，用于分子设计。该方法在33个设计任务中表现优于大100-1000倍的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大模型上下文学习在分子设计中效果有限，且每个属性的标记数据稀缺。ChEMBL等数据库包含数百万生物检测的分子属性，但每个属性的标记数据仍然不足。

Method: 开发了演示条件扩散模型(DemoDiff)，使用少量分子-评分示例而非文本描述来定义任务上下文。采用Node Pair Encoding的新分子分词器，在基序级别表示分子，节点数减少5.5倍。在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练了7亿参数模型。

Result: 在6个类别的33个设计任务中，DemoDiff匹配或超越了比其大100-1000倍的语言模型，平均排名为3.63，而领域特定方法的排名为5.25-10.20。

Conclusion: DemoDiff作为分子基础模型，在上下文分子设计中表现出色，为分子设计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our
code is available at https://github.com/liugangcode/DemoDiff.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RFOD框架，一种基于随机森林的表格数据异常检测方法，通过特征级条件重构处理混合类型数据，结合调整后的Gower距离和不确定性加权平均实现精确且可解释的异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理混合类型表格数据时存在语义信息丢失和可解释性不足的问题，在网络安全、金融欺诈检测和医疗等高风险领域需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: RFOD将异常检测重新定义为特征级条件重构问题，为每个特征训练专门的随机森林模型，结合调整后的Gower距离进行单元格级评分，并使用不确定性加权平均聚合为行级异常分数。

Result: 在15个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，RFOD在检测准确性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法，同时对混合类型表格数据具有更好的鲁棒性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Conclusion: RFOD框架成功解决了混合类型表格数据异常检测中的关键挑战，提供了一种准确、鲁棒且可解释的解决方案，特别适用于高风险应用领域。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种控制优化确定性等价(OCE)风险的方法，扩展了传统的保形风险控制框架，能够处理尾部风险，并引入了端到端的保形风险训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。现有保形风险控制方法只能控制期望损失，无法处理对尾部风险敏感的实际应用。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类的方法，包括条件风险价值(CVaR)等尾部风险度量；引入了端到端的保形风险训练，在模型训练或微调过程中通过保形OCE风险控制进行微分。

Result: 该方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池储能操作金融风险的应用中，相比后处理方法显著提高了平均性能，同时保持了可证明的风险保证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别适用于对尾部风险敏感的高风险应用，并通过端到端训练改善了平均性能。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化跨样本记忆化风险，包括客户端内部和客户端之间的记忆化，并研究了影响记忆化的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于联邦学习。

Method: 开发了一个框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化联邦学习中的客户端内部和客户端间记忆化，并研究了解码策略、前缀长度和FL算法等影响因素。

Result: 发现联邦学习模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内部数据比客户端间数据更容易被记忆，记忆化程度受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习存在记忆化风险，需要更细粒度的检测方法，客户端内部记忆化比客户端间记忆化更显著，训练和推理策略会影响记忆化程度。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑方法解决量化神经网络优化中的梯度问题，保证收敛性并保持原始量化损失的全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，梯度几乎处处为零且在量化阈值处未定义。现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 引入LOTION框架，基于Nesterov平滑思想，用无偏随机舍入噪声下的期望损失来近似量化损失表面，形成连续可优化的损失函数。

Result: 在标准优化器下保证收敛到局部最小值，使用随机舍入噪声时能保持原始量化损失的全局最优解。在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一种有理论保证的量化优化方法，有效解决了量化神经网络训练中的梯度问题。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Deconfounder方法，通过利用干扰揭示潜在混杂因素结构，解决空间因果推断中的未测量空间混杂因素和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、空气污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个而忽略另一个。

Method: 两阶段方法：使用带空间先验的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因素，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder持续改进效应估计效果，扩展了SpaCE基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: 结合虚拟成像工具与强化学习优化CT协议，在保证图像质量的同时减少79.7%的优化步骤


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具生成肝脏病变模型图像，采用PPO强化学习算法优化管电压、管电流、重建核、层厚和像素大小等参数

Result: 强化学习方法在所有测试案例中均达到全局最大可检测性指数(d')，比穷举搜索减少79.7%的优化步骤

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合为CT协议管理提供了准确且计算高效的优化框架，具有很好的灵活性

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

TL;DR: 提出基于白金汉π定理的零样本迁移方法，通过无量纲缩放实现强化学习策略在不同机器人、任务和环境间的泛化，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在面临不同物理参数的新机器人、任务或环境时泛化能力差，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于白金汉π定理，通过将策略的输入（观测）和输出（动作）缩放到无量纲空间，实现预训练策略到新系统环境的零样本迁移。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境（模拟摆、物理摆、HalfCheetah）中，缩放迁移在动态相似情境下无性能损失，在非相似情境下始终优于朴素迁移方法。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强强化学习策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了超链接、引用等丰富的结构信息，而这些结构在许多实际数据集中提供重要上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序连接和并行缓存，并引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线方法。顺序连接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中难以发现有效动作序列，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，可以指导RL探索。现有方法存在刚性依赖问题，需要更灵活的方式来利用LLM的指导。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，让RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，保持软约束的灵活性，无需修改现有RL算法。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的收益随任务难度增加而提升。在最复杂环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力来加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，提供了一种结合LLM知识和RL灵活性的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个主要挑战：(i)每个目标函数都需要从头训练新模型；(ii)性能对架构和超参数选择高度敏感；(iii)模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络来逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后将学习到的参数用于初始化更复杂目标函数的网络。引入域映射机制将任意域输入变换到参考域，保持与预训练模型的结构对应性。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的大量数值实验表明，该方法在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

*Junyi Wu,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PO-CKAN是一个基于分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的物理信息深度算子框架，用于逼近偏微分方程的解算子，在多个基准问题上表现出优于传统方法的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统物理信息神经网络在参数化时变偏微分方程中学习解算子的效率和精度问题，需要开发更有效的算子学习框架。

Method: 采用DeepONet架构，集成分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(CKAN)子网络，并结合物理信息神经网络(PINNs)原理来强制物理一致性。

Result: 在ν=0.01的Burgers方程上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet将平均相对L²误差降低了约48%，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准问题上也达到了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，为参数化时变偏微分方程提供快速预测能力，在多个挑战性基准问题上验证了其准确性和有效性。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的LWE攻击在某些参数设置下表现优于传统攻击，但缺乏可访问的数据限制了AI从业者研究和改进这些攻击的能力。创建LWE数据用于AI模型训练既耗时又需要大量计算资源和领域专业知识。

Method: 开发了TAPAS数据集，涵盖多种LWE设置，可供AI从业者直接使用来原型化新的LWE破解方法。

Result: 创建了TAPAS数据集，建立了攻击性能基线，并为未来工作指明了方向。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集填补了LWE攻击AI研究中的数据空白，将加速后量子密码学的AI研究进展。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Edu-EmotionNet框架，通过联合建模时间情绪演化和模态可靠性，用于在线教育中的鲁棒情感识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略并假设模态输入始终可靠，但在真实学习环境中这很少成立，需要更鲁棒的方法

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测确保时间一致性

Result: 在教育子集IEMOCAP和MOSEI上达到最先进性能，对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该框架能捕捉情绪转换并自适应优先可靠信号，适合部署在实时学习系统中

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Result: 经过LoRA微调后，在所有评估指标上都实现了持续改进，证明小型模型具备非平凡的图结构推理能力。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型能够有效处理图结构数据，通过高效参数调优可以适应结构推理任务。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分布通常存在不平衡（长尾）现象，这导致深度分类模型偏向频繁类别，而对尾部类别表现不佳。

Method: 第一阶段从信息理论角度提出新的表示学习技术，理论等价于最小化类内距离；第二阶段开发新的采样策略，选择数学上信息丰富的实例来修正多数类偏见的决策边界。

Result: 该方法在多个长尾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并通过广泛实验验证。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段学习方法有效缓解了多数类偏见，同时保留了数据集中的有价值信息，在长尾分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 边缘环境中的实时多视角3D重建面临资源可用性动态变化、图像质量下降、网络连接不稳定等挑战，需要确保在合理时间内获得高质量重建结果。

Method: 使用两个协作的Q学习代理：一个负责摄像头选择，一个负责服务器选择，两者完全在线运行，通过与边缘环境交互学习策略。构建了包含实验室设备和FABRIC基础设施的分布式测试平台来模拟真实干扰场景。

Result: 该框架在动态环境中有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的3D重建，为关键边缘应用提供支持。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测公平性问题，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出FairTTE框架，整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术来识别和量化医学影像数据集中的不同偏见来源。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有形式偏见的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型来解决医学影像预后中的公平性问题。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)与负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明在共享随机性的条件下，两者的表示相似性矩阵保持接近，但参数空间会发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但这种损失层面的相似性是否意味着表示层面也保持对齐仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 在共享随机性（相同初始化、批次和数据增强）条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其表示相似性矩阵的接近程度，并提供理论保证。

Result: 证明CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，对齐度随类别数、温度增加而改善，但参数空间会指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的原则性桥梁，CL-NSCL对齐性随规模和温度增强，NSCL比其它监督目标更能追踪CL。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，即特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，这使得难以一致地识别和分析模型行为。

Method: 引入自适应时间掩码（ATM），通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，并基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs等方法实现了显著更低的吸收分数，同时保持了优秀的重构质量。

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了一个原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Motivation: 探索为什么在单任务训练的深度神经网络能很好地建模整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层中的腹侧、背侧和外侧通路涉及不同的功能过程。

Method: 应用稀疏分解方法识别各视觉通路中的主导组件，并引入稀疏组件对齐(SCA)方法来测量大脑与机器之间的表征对齐。

Result: 发现腹侧通路组件对脸部、地点、身体、文字和食物有选择性；外侧通路对社会互动、隐含动作和手部动作有选择性；背侧通路组件较难解释。SCA显示标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度更高。

Conclusion: SCA方法比传统群体层面几何方法能更精细地揭示大脑与机器视觉系统之间的表征对齐差异，提供了对系统潜在神经调谐轴的敏感测量。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Conclusion: 提出的CNN框架在多模态子空间聚类中表现出色，不同融合策略都能有效提升性能。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

TL;DR: 提出了Dig-DEC，一种无需乐观主义、仅通过信息增益驱动探索的模型无关决策估计系数，改进了现有DEC方法，能够处理对抗性环境，并在混合MDP中实现了首个模型无关的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性环境，且存在遗憾边界与模型类大小相关的差距。需要一种既能处理对抗性环境又能缩小遗憾边界的方法。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，移除乐观主义，纯粹通过信息增益驱动探索。改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下可以更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型无关的遗憾边界，将遗憾边界从T^{3/4}改进到T^{2/3}(在线)和从T^{5/6}改进到T^{7/9}(离线)，在贝尔曼完备MDP中从T^{2/3}改进到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC是首个能够匹配乐观主义方法性能的DEC方法，解决了Liu等人(2025)留下的主要开放问题，为处理对抗性环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from

TL;DR: 提出了ACPO框架，通过难度感知课程和基于归因的贡献评估来解决RLVR中的探索-利用平衡问题，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习与可验证奖励方法在复杂推理中存在探索与利用不平衡的问题，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早熵崩溃，限制了模型性能。

Method: ACPO框架采用分阶段方法，包含难度感知课程学习。通过轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，改善探索；同时使用因子化奖励系统精确量化每个推理步骤的层次贡献，确保准确的信用分配。

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等具有挑战性的基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过平衡探索与利用，有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信边界项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来理解算法的动态行为。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，不确定性对应频率分量，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器。

Result: 证明了UCB算法的置信边界项在频域中等效于与访问次数平方根成反比的时变增益，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态边界。

Conclusion: 该理论为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，并为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Motivation: 解决车联网中由于数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关的信道不确定性导致的半持续调度信息年龄恶化问题。

Method: 建立受车辆速度、密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计双路径优化方案：DDPG基于状态空间和奖励函数进行优化，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量示例后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后能实现更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方案能有效改善车联网中的信息年龄性能，两种方法各有优势且互补。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Motivation: 小地球数据具有有限的短期监测变异性和时空相关性，传统深度学习方法需要任务特定训练，而基础模型存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差问题。

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三种典型场景中的比较结果显示，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）具有更高的准确性和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单而鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效处理跨场景的预测任务。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题时表达能力有限，静态域分解方法需要大量超参数调优且容易陷入局部最小值。需要一种能够动态适应解的特征并自动调整域分解的方法。

Method: 基于经典网格细化技术，在训练过程中动态调整现有子域以适应解的特征，并在高残差损失区域引入新的子域，为难以表示的解区域提供额外的表达能力。

Result: AB-PINNs能够有效解决各种复杂的多尺度偏微分方程，不同子域可以学习捕获底层解的不同尺度特征。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适合多尺度问题，能够防止陷入局部最小值并减少超参数调优需求，在复杂多尺度PDE求解中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练阶段优化，忽视了推理阶段的改进机会，特别是罕见特征组合会降低预测性能

Method: 使用分层概率哈希估计特征组合出现频率作为置信度，基于置信度采样生成多个推理路径，聚合多路径预测结果

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT与现有CTR模型的兼容性和有效性

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化提升预测可靠性

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习(EDL)方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确性和基于置信度的样本剔除后的性能保持。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习机制有效解决了EDL方法在动态环境中的校准问题，可学习的狄利克雷先验提供了对类别分布和训练动态的灵活适应。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化噪声（异方差），这会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在传统前馈预测器基础上增加了学习的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，然后调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个数据集领域（设备能耗、医疗保健、环境监测）的实验结果表明，VARNN相比静态、动态和循环基线模型实现了更优越的性能，获得了更低的测试MSE，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供了鲁棒的预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Result: 在九种场景下的实验表明，LAGA显著提升了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和鲁棒图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This

investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Conclusion: LOs可以固有地学习正则化属性，挑战了显式优化目标损失正则化的传统必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Motivation: 解决RLIR中模型倾向于高估高置信度轨迹导致的系统偏差问题，这种偏差会导致奖励估计有偏和不稳定训练。

Method: 提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型、自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择来缓解系统偏差。

Result: RLER比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现了稳定扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效缓解了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签设置下实现了接近RLVR的性能，具有很高的应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景提供了可靠且个性化的癫痫预测解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLM能够进行更高效、约束对齐且领域适应性强的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

*Xiaolong Tu,Dawei Chen,Kyungtae Han,Onur Altintas,Haoxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PlatformX是一个完全自动化的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，通过集成能量驱动的搜索空间、可转移的核级能量预测器、帕累托多目标搜索算法和高分辨率运行时能量分析系统，显著降低了搜索开销并保持精度和能量保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法由于高时间成本、大量手动分析和在具有复杂设备特定能量行为的多样化硬件平台上扩展性差，在现实世界部署中仍然不实用。

Method: PlatformX集成了四个关键组件：(i) 能量驱动的搜索空间；(ii) 跨设备可转移的核级能量预测器；(iii) 帕累托多目标搜索算法；(iv) 使用外部监视器自动进行高分辨率运行时能量分析的系统。

Result: 在多个移动平台上评估显示，PlatformX显著减少了搜索开销，同时保持精度和能量保真度。它识别出的模型精度高达0.94或每推理仅需0.16 mJ，在精度和效率上都优于MobileNet-V2。

Conclusion: PlatformX是一个完全自动化和可转移的HW-NAS框架，克服了现有方法的局限性，为边缘设备设计高效的深度神经网络提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

TL;DR: 提出SQS框架，通过贝叶斯变分学习同时进行剪枝和低比特量化，实现比现有方法更高的压缩率，同时保持可比较的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独进行权重剪枝或低比特量化，导致压缩率不理想。需要统一框架同时优化剪枝和量化，以获得更高的压缩率。

Method: 采用尖峰-平板先验诱导稀疏性，使用高斯混合模型建模量化权重以实现低比特精度，通过贝叶斯变分学习统一优化剪枝和量化。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法比现有方法获得更高的压缩率，同时性能下降可比较。

Conclusion: SQS框架通过同时优化剪枝和量化实现了更高的压缩效率，为资源受限设备上的神经网络部署提供了有效的压缩方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在噪声遗忘数据集下的大语言模型遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号保留，遗忘过程仍能保持稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法假设能获得干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、重写或带水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架来分析遗忘稳健性。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的稳健性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。关键语义组件在表面形式大幅变化的情况下仍保持一致的遗忘驱动作用。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了遗忘在噪声数据下的稳健性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的极端token现象（如注意力汇和值状态流失）会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，这些问题的根源在于注意力与近零值状态之间的相互强化机制。

Method: VGA引入基于值向量的可学习数据依赖门控，直接调节注意力输出。通过理论梯度分析证明，基于值状态自身的门控比基于输入嵌入的门控方法更有效。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇的形成，稳定了值状态范数，提升了模型性能、量化鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效解决了Transformer中的极端token问题。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器来协调可瘦身模型的分布式推理，在保持准确性的同时显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽略了适应异构硬件和动态运行条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例扩展，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例、批配置），降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在精度降至最瘦模型（70.3%）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在保持更高精度时也能实现延迟和能耗的总体降低。

Conclusion: 该混合调度框架能有效平衡效率和吞吐量，适应异构硬件环境，实现多种精度-延迟权衡。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有配体设计方法存在三个主要限制：伪从头设计、有限对接建模和配体类型不灵活，需要新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架，将受体和配体的一般对接知识融入骨干模型，通过结合预测实例化为反向梯度流指导配体生成；使用可学习的3D点云表示进行可微分表面建模；为不同配体类型提供定制化设计并集成到统一的梯度反演框架中。

Result: 在9个场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock在蛋白质配体设计和分子配体设计方面分别比最先进基线平均提升了27.1%和11.7%。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过渐进式流程和可微分表面建模，有效解决了配体设计中的关键挑战，并在多个场景中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了过去十年中AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，机器学习模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在反弹效应。仅提高效率无法确保可持续性，需要减少AI活动和质疑资源密集型训练的规模与频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型性能提升，计算需求急剧增加，带来了严重的能源消耗和环境影响。研究旨在评估各种优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年中包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的整个生命周期，分析显卡生产和模型训练能耗的趋势。

Result: 研究发现两个关键趋势：显卡生产的影响稳步增长；即使考虑碳密集型电力混合等减排策略，ML模型训练的能耗和环境影响仍在指数级增长，优化策略未能减轻训练带来的影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保机器学习的可持续性，必须考虑硬件的整个生命周期而非仅使用阶段，同时需要减少AI活动并质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估存在缺陷，主要使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御能力。

Method: 采用自适应攻击策略，系统调优和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索）。

Result: 成功绕过了12种最新防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原报告的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，才能做出可靠和令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

Motivation: 深度学习训练中多种优化器倾向于找到接近全局最优解，本文从假设收敛到任意点的反向视角出发，研究这种假设的后果，特别是与边缘稳定性现象相关的优化器行为。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，分析一般半代数C²函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出了两种增强特征值过滤的新算法。

Result: 理论分析表明梯度下降天然避免尖锐最小值，SAM算法更积极地偏好宽盆地。数值实验在前馈神经网络上支持了这些结论。

Conclusion: 不同优化器通过超参数充当特征值过滤器，标准梯度下降避免尖锐最小值，SAM算法偏好宽盆地，提出的新算法能有效促进更宽的最小值。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Result: 实验显示IGCARL相比最先进方法成功率至少提高27.9%，显著增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Conclusion: IGCARL能有效提升DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，对抗战略对抗攻击

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Conclusion: 分割技术能有效减少时间模糊性，促进监督算法的学习过程，未来将结合加权特征进一步优化早期异常检测。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Motivation: 解决CTC-based ASR系统在资源受限环境中的计算和内存瓶颈问题，传统CTC解码器在token级操作上效率低下，占用高达90%的处理时间。

Method: 提出帧级token剪枝方法，使用相对概率阈值指导，在每帧动态消除低概率token，减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现10.5倍运行加速和2.78倍内存减少，WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability

TL;DR: BioCodec是一个受神经编解码器启发的表示学习框架，用于将高维、嘈杂的生物信号（如EEG）转换为离散标记，在多个下游任务中表现出色，特别是在低资源环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维、嘈杂的时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。现有的大型预训练模型方法面临挑战，需要替代方案来有效解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Result: BioCodec在多个下游任务中表现优异，包括临床诊断、睡眠生理学、语音解码和运动想象，尤其在低资源设置下。代码本使用和EEG连接性的空间一致性分析提供了定性验证。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了通用解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，适用于多种生物信号类型，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

*Yimu Zhang,Yuanshi Liu,Cong Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaPM是一种自适应训练策略，通过部分动量实现内存高效优化器，减少90%以上动量内存占用，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型训练中，动量广泛使用但存储动量存在内存挑战，需要开发内存高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不使用完整动量，并通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减少性能损失。

Result: 经验验证显示，AdaPM在60M到1.5B语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中，减少90%以上动量内存，结合二阶统计量技术可进一步减少95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过自适应部分动量策略，在保持训练效率和性能的同时，显著降低了优化器的内存需求。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

TL;DR: 提出MemLoss方法，利用先前生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本）来改进机器学习模型的对抗训练，在保持干净数据性能的同时提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗训练方法在提升模型鲁棒性时往往牺牲了在干净数据上的准确性。需要一种方法能够平衡自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性。

Method: MemLoss方法利用先前训练周期中生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本），在后续训练中重复使用这些样本来增强模型训练，实现更平衡的性能提升。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上的实验结果表明，MemLoss方法相比现有对抗训练方法获得了更好的准确性，同时保持了强大的对抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MemLoss通过利用记忆对抗样本提供了一种有效的对抗训练方法，能够在自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的成员推断游戏来高效审计数据记录的最坏情况隐私风险，并改进了DP-SGD算法，通过自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略减少组间隐私风险差异，提升差分隐私机器学习的隐私保护公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于数据记录的平均隐私风险评估组隐私风险，可能低估组隐私风险及其差异，且最坏情况隐私风险评估方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入新的成员推断游戏来高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进标准DP-SGD算法，采用自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能更严格地测量组隐私风险，可靠评估组间隐私风险差异；改进的算法有效减少了组隐私风险差异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够提升差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性，通过更准确的隐私风险评估和算法改进来减少组间隐私风险差异。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在延迟反馈情境下的上下文多臂老虎机(CMAB)问题的遗憾最小化算法，包括有限策略类和一般函数逼近两种设置，并建立了相应的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在延迟反馈情境下的上下文多臂老虎机问题，其中损失观测由对手选择的延迟到达，这在现实应用中很常见。

Method: 对于有限策略类，直接使用策略类；对于一般函数逼近，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机，并提出基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性分析。

Result: 有限策略类下获得最优期望遗憾边界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；一般函数逼近下获得O(√(KT R_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))，其中β ≤ log|F|时进一步得到O(√(KT log|F|) + √(d_max D log|F|))。

Conclusion: 本文为延迟反馈的CMAB问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，在一般函数逼近设置下与下界相差√d_max因子。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机来自专家知识获取和从人类反馈中学习，需要从成对比较中估计复杂的多变量信念密度。

Method: 方法包括：证明信念密度和胜者密度的分数向量共线，给出温度场的解析公式，在Bradley-Terry模型下提出温度场估计器，使用基于分数缩放退火Langevin动力学生成的温度样本训练扩散模型。

Result: 结果表明，仅使用数百到数千个成对比较就能学习模拟专家的复杂多变量信念密度。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能够有效地从有限的成对比较数据中估计复杂的密度函数。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和优化器层面的稳定化，在提升领域性能的同时缓解通用能力遗忘，并降低40%以上的训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs领域适应中的权衡问题：提升专业领域能力通常以牺牲通用能力为代价，现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录动态Top-K token子集（包含黄金标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。结合MoClip优化器，限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH等通用基准上缓解遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了静态知识库的覆盖不足和时间过时问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态预构建知识库，存在覆盖不足和时间过时问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 采用多轮强化学习框架，包含动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统和可学习多尺度提示压缩方法，实现LLMs与KGs的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识抽取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在QA任务中取得更优性能，准确率和知识覆盖率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过LLMs与KGs的协同进化有效解决了静态知识库的局限性，为动态信息环境下的知识增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性的EHR表示方法基准测试，比较了多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种范式，发现在不同临床场景下事件流模型表现最佳，且特征选择策略需根据临床设置调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)支持临床预测的深度学习应用，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确，需要建立标准化基准来比较不同EHR表示方法。

Method: 创建标准化基准，在MIMIC-IV(ICU任务)和EHRSHOT(纵向护理)两个临床设置中比较三种EHR表示范式：多变量时间序列(使用Transformer、MLP、LSTM、Retain)、事件流(使用CLMBR和基于计数的模型)、文本事件流(使用8-20B LLM)，并分析基于数据缺失的特征剪枝影响。

Result: 事件流模型始终提供最强性能；预训练模型如CLMBR在少样本设置中样本效率高，而基于计数的模型在数据充足时具有竞争力；特征选择策略需适应临床设置：剪枝稀疏特征改善ICU预测，但保留这些特征对纵向任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为基于临床背景和数据制度选择EHR表示提供了实用指导，事件流是推荐的表示方法，但特征选择策略应根据具体临床任务调整。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，能耗和数据隐私成为关键问题。设备端学习能降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模扩大成为设备端训练的主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到Transformer模型，引入Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)，通过将训练限制在模型关键信息所在的固定子空间来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确性的同时，将内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了Transformer模型在设备端训练时的内存和计算效率问题，为设备端学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin方法在增强模型鲁棒性方面有潜力，但实际性能下降比预期更严重，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Conclusion: 该工作为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Conclusion: RepDL有效解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不一致性问题，提供了确定性和可复现性的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is

TL;DR: 本文揭示了持续学习中灾难性遗忘的根本原因：新任务训练本质上是对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失函数的尖锐方向对齐，导致旧任务损失快速增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度网络中灾难性遗忘的深层原因，现有研究尚未完全揭示其根本机制。

Method: 理论分析表明这种对抗性对齐源于训练的低秩偏置，通过前向和后向传播将两个方向限制在同一低维子空间中。提出backGP方法来处理后向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘的根本机制是新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，通过处理前后向传播引起的对齐问题可以有效缓解遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态提示优化问题，并开发了MPO框架，通过联合优化文本和非文本提示来提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法仅限于文本领域，无法充分利用多模态大语言模型的潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出MPO框架，通过保持对齐的联合优化更新，并利用贝叶斯选择策略基于先前评估指导候选提示的选择过程。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Flow Matching教师模型和MLP学生策略的在线强化学习方法，通过奖励模型和正则化机制解决FM策略在线学习的不稳定性和高推理成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching在模仿学习中表现出色，但缺乏环境交互和探索能力，导致在未见场景中泛化能力差。直接在线优化FM策略存在梯度不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 使用简单的MLP学生策略进行在线探索和RL更新，通过基于教师FM模型的奖励模型提供专家数据分布信息，并用教师FM模型正则化学生策略行为以稳定学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过将FM的表达能力与MLP的高效在线学习相结合，成功解决了FM策略在线优化的挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对化学反应可行性预测的质蕴涵解释方法，旨在提高机器学习模型的透明度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的化学反应可行性预测模型虽然预测成功，但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要开发能够解释模型决策的解释方法。

Method: 引入了一种针对化学反应领域的质蕴涵解释（最小充分原因）新表述，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法。

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然经常包含冗余的键和原子，但始终捕捉了对预测反应可行性至关重要的分子属性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别化学反应预测中的关键分子特征，为自动化合成规划提供了更透明的解释机制。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实证验证了所提出方法的特性，证明了时间感知激励机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的时间感知数据共享框架能够有效激励早期参与，促进协作数据共享和机器学习，同时保证公平性和个体理性。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: 金融机器学习模型容易受到模型漂移影响，在发展中经济体（如中亚和高加索地区）由于频繁的宏观经济冲击，这一问题尤为严重。目前缺乏针对这些地区金融数据的漂移缓解方法研究。

Method: 研究使用合成异常值方法来提高模型对意外冲击的稳定性，并引入了一个两层级框架来评估性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Result: 实验表明，在宏观经济表格数据集中添加少量合成异常值通常能提高模型稳定性，但最佳添加比例因数据集和模型而异。

Conclusion: 合成异常值是一种有效的模型漂移缓解方法，特别是在发展中经济体的金融数据环境中，但需要根据具体场景调整使用策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，来自GitHub和社交媒体等平台的多样化提示数据集不断涌现，这些数据集涵盖广泛的应用和内容类型，但目前缺乏对这些数据集的系统性分析和优化方法。

Method: 收集来自多个渠道的提示数据集，进行系统性分析；提出基于词性和依存结构句法嵌入的提示优化方法，通过识别提示的中心表示并引导LLM将提示重写向该中心来优化提示。

Result: 揭示了不同类别提示构建的共同点和差异，区分了提示与其他文本语料库的不同特征；提出的提示优化方法能够提升模型输出的意义性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提示数据集提供了系统性分析框架，提出的句法嵌入优化方法能够有效提升提示质量，促进了更好的提示工程实践。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 解决基于方程的Modelica模型中代数环带来的计算效率问题，避免传统方法中需要监督数据集和多重有效解平均的问题。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，并通过残差训练策略确保解的一致性。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统上应用，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了代数环的高效替代，显著提升了仿真性能，同时保证了计算精度，为大规模系统仿真提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 本文为多智能体模仿学习建立了完整的理论框架，证明了非交互式方法的局限性，并提出了高效的交互式算法，填补了该领域的理论空白。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Result: 证明了黑盒安全对齐的可行性，为资源受限的组织提供了可扩展的安全对齐途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为第三方利益相关者提供了无需模型访问权限的灵活安全对齐方案，适用于快速发展的LLM生态系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 生成模型评估具有挑战性，标准指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人类评估虽更可靠但成本高且存在噪声，因为参与者专业知识、注意力和勤奋程度各不相同。

Method: 提出BBQ方法，这是一个贝叶斯Bradley-Terry变体，通过期望最大化算法显式建模评分者质量，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除，并提供保证单调似然收敛。

Result: 实证结果显示，BBQ实现了更快的收敛、良好校准的不确定性估计，以及相比基线Bradley-Terry模型更稳健、可解释的排名，即使在有噪声或众包评分者的情况下也是如此。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现生成模型更可靠和成本效益高的人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Method: 开发了两阶段自回归图注意力网络(GAT)模型，将系统表示为运营事件(到达和出发)的时空图，并加入了站台和车站拥堵等细粒度特征。

Result: 虽然提出的GATv2模型在纯误差指标(MAE)上被更简单的持续性基线挑战，但在分类延误事件方面实现了持续更高的精度，这对于可靠的决策支持工具至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时列车延误预测提供了可行的解决方案，特别是在分类精度方面优于基线方法，适合作为决策支持工具部署。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Conclusion: 高斯-牛顿近似对预条件处理非常有效，逐层Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益，当前近似方法与理想化逐层oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Motivation: 虽然softmax attention在序列模型中表现优异，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方案如SSMs虽然效率更高，但它们在信息处理方面的根本差异仍未得到充分理解。

Method: 使用动力学系统框架表示不同类型的attention机制，通过分析特征值谱与SSMs进行结构化比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行广泛的实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长距离依赖建模的关键方面，揭示了与任务需求一致的光谱特征；架构修改对特征值谱和任务性能的影响存在对应关系。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解并最终改进序列模型能力提供了一个原则性指标，强化了其在模型分析中的重要性。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

Method: CHUCKLE框架通过众包数据集中的标注者一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型同样困难。

Result: 实验结果显示，CHUCKLE使LSTM相对平均准确率提升6.56%，Transformer提升1.61%，同时减少梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: 基于人类感知的课程学习能同时提高训练效率和模型鲁棒性，在情感识别等主观任务中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了权重初始化对神经网络训练的影响，包括ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer，发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围能提供稳定训练，Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中表现更优，并观察到transformer中不同层权重方差随深度的变化规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化在训练开始时控制信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度有重要影响，需要系统研究不同初始化策略在不同网络架构中的表现。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始标准差的方法，比较Kaiming和Xavier初始化在ReLU网络中的表现，并在12层GPT-2风格模型中追踪各层Q/K/V权重方差在预训练过程中的变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定训练带；Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中收敛更快更稳定；transformer浅层权重方差快速扩张而深层变化更平缓。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化原理与现代transformer行为，为稳健训练提供了简单实用的指导方案。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Conclusion: 单峰偏好结构能够显著简化在线随机匹配问题的计算复杂度，提出的算法在理论和实践上都取得了良好的性能。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象为多模态研究中的参数高效扩展提供了新方向，交叉注意力的两种对齐机制可以共存于推荐模型中。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流(USFs)在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督异常检测主要围绕深度单类分类(如Deep SVDD)和密度估计(如标准化流)两种范式展开，但两者之间的理论联系尚未明确。本文旨在揭示这两种方法的内在联系，并基于此提出改进方案。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流(USFs)，这是一种具有常数雅可比行列式的标准化流。通过理论证明，使用最大似然训练USFs等价于优化Deep SVDD目标，并具有防止表示崩溃的独特正则化。

Result: 实验表明，USFs在负对数似然和潜在范数之间建立了比Deep SVDD或非USFs更紧密的对齐关系。将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案，在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，无论是图像级还是像素级检测，都能获得一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: USFs统一了异常检测的两大主要范式，不仅推进了理论理解，还提升了实际性能。建议在现代异常检测架构中使用USFs作为非USFs的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Motivation: 现有AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但这些监控器可能成为单点故障。作者研究当攻击者了解协议和监控模型时的自适应攻击场景。

Method: 作者实例化了一种简单的自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，测试前沿模型在两种主要AI控制基准上的表现。

Result: 攻击成功绕过各种监控器并完成恶意任务，且Defer-to-Resample协议反而会放大提示注入，使其变成最佳n次攻击。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线对抗模仿学习(AIL)，提出了一种基于模型的AIL算法(MB-AIL)，在一般函数逼近下建立了无视野限制、二阶样本复杂度保证，并证明了其达到了极小极大最优样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线对抗模仿学习虽然经验表现良好，但在线交互的好处和随机性的影响仍未被充分理解。论文旨在填补这些理论空白。

Method: 提出了基于模型的AIL算法(MB-AIL)，使用离线专家演示和在线无奖励环境交互，在一般函数逼近框架下进行分析。

Result: MB-AIL在有限专家演示下达到了在线交互的极小极大最优样本复杂度，并且在专家演示方面与下界匹配，实验验证了其样本效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MB-AIL算法在理论和实验上都表现出色，为在线对抗模仿学习提供了坚实的理论基础和实用的算法实现。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出BaNEL算法，仅使用失败尝试进行后训练，最小化奖励评估次数，在稀疏奖励任务中显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和信息丰富的奖励函数，但在困难问题中面临两个挑战：基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，奖励评估成本高昂

Method: 将学习失败规律建模为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否类似先前失败，并引导生成远离失败

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中，无需观察成功样本即可提升模型性能，成功率比现有新颖性奖励方法高出几个数量级，同时使用更少的奖励评估

Conclusion: BaNEL算法能够有效解决稀疏奖励环境下的学习挑战，通过仅利用失败数据实现模型改进

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geo-STARS是一个地理感知的时空建模框架，用于预测不同流域和空间尺度的河流水温。通过引入地理感知嵌入，该模型能够捕获跨区域和尺度的共享模式，即使在观测数据稀疏的情况下也能有效学习时空模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物理模型和数据驱动模型由于环境生态系统中固有的数据异质性，难以泛化到不同的空间区域和尺度。这个问题在训练样本有限的情况下更加严重。

Method: 提出Geo-STARS框架，引入地理感知嵌入来显式捕获跨空间区域和尺度的共享原则和模式。将该嵌入集成到门控时空图神经网络中，使模型能够在地理和水文上下文指导下学习复杂的时空模式。

Result: 使用美国东海岸多个流域37年的真实数据集进行评估，Geo-STARS在跨区域和尺度的泛化性能上优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS为可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Motivation: 解决神经网络模型优化中的分布式计算、压缩技术和高效训练等关键挑战，满足对可扩展和资源高效模型日益增长的需求。

Method: 开发PETRA AutoML框架，应用进化优化算法优化模型架构和训练策略，包含剪枝、量化和损失正则化技术。

Result: 在真实世界金融事件序列、图像和时间序列基准测试中，模型大小减少达75%，延迟降低达33%，吞吐量提升13%，目标指标无明显下降。

Conclusion: PETRA框架能有效提升神经网络模型的性能和可扩展性，实现显著的资源优化效果。

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级无监督框架，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的令牌序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留核心时间动态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等重要，导致在长序列或噪声序列中效率低下、鲁棒性差且可扩展性有限。需要利用时间序列中潜在的时序结构、局部平稳机制转换、重复模式和变异性爆发等特征。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率下的变化点，然后使用均值等简单函数或GMM等生成模型对每个片段进行总结，作为模型无关的预处理器与现有无监督时间序列编码器集成。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能够实现85-90%的完整模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本，在噪声条件下提高鲁棒性，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线方法。

Conclusion: STaTS为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了一个原则性的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

TL;DR: 提出MODE（混合动态专家）框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，实现行为机制的发现和跨机制转换的长期预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统常包含重叠行为机制的复杂混合，传统基于流的方法假设局部平滑动态，难以处理机制间噪声和不规则转换

Method: 图形建模框架，使用神经门控机制分解复杂动态为稀疏可解释组件，允许代理跳转到不同控制规律

Result: 在合成和真实计算生物学数据集上验证：成功进行无监督分类、挑战性预测任务，在单细胞RNA测序数据中区分增殖与分化动态并预测细胞命运决定时机

Conclusion: MODE特别适用于处理噪声机制转换，解决了计算生物学中的关键挑战

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于差异中差异（DiD）模型的敏感性分析方法，评估DiD估计对平行趋势假设违反的稳健性，特别关注未观测混杂因素的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiD模型在经济学和政治学等领域广泛应用，但其识别依赖于条件平行趋势假设。该假设可能因未观测混杂因素而违反，需要系统方法来评估估计结果的稳健性。

Method: 基于双机器学习估计，扩展了基于Riesz表示的敏感性分析方法。建立了2×2设置和交错处理采用设置中点和置信区间的渐近边界。

Result: 通过模拟实验验证了敏感性方法和诊断的有效性，并在两个实证应用中展示了该方法的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法使研究人员能够透明地评估和传达其因果估计结果的可信度，将平行趋势违反的表述与预测试、协变量基准测试和标准报告统计等经验证据联系起来。

Abstract: Difference-in-differences (DiD) is one of the most popular approaches for
empirical research in economics, political science, and beyond. Identification
in these models is based on the conditional parallel trends assumption: In the
absence of treatment, the average outcome of the treated and untreated group
are assumed to evolve in parallel over time, conditional on pre-treatment
covariates. We introduce a novel approach to sensitivity analysis for DiD
models that assesses the robustness of DiD estimates to violations of this
assumption due to unobservable confounders, allowing researchers to
transparently assess and communicate the credibility of their causal estimation
results. Our method focuses on estimation by Double Machine Learning and
extends previous work on sensitivity analysis based on Riesz Representation in
cross-sectional settings. We establish asymptotic bounds for point estimates
and confidence intervals in the canonical $2\times2$ setting and group-time
causal parameters in settings with staggered treatment adoption. Our approach
makes it possible to relate the formulation of parallel trends violation to
empirical evidence from (1) pre-testing, (2) covariate benchmarking and (3)
standard reporting statistics and visualizations. We provide extensive
simulation experiments demonstrating the validity of our sensitivity approach
and diagnostics and apply our approach to two empirical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果机器学习在观测数据中估计因果效应时依赖不可验证的假设（如无未观测混杂因素），当这些假设被违反时，估计结果会产生偏差，敏感性分析能够评估这种稳健性问题。

Method: 采用Chernozhukov等人(2023)提出的非参数边界方法，该方法能够推导未观测变量导致的偏差边界，并与现代因果机器学习推断工具完全兼容。

Result: 通过Booking.com的模拟用例展示了敏感性分析的实际应用价值，证明了该方法能够有效评估因果效应估计的稳健性。

Conclusion: 敏感性分析在现实场景中具有重要作用，应提高对其重要性的认识，特别是在因果推断面临未观测混杂因素风险时。

Abstract: Causal Machine Learning has emerged as a powerful tool for flexibly
estimating causal effects from observational data in both industry and
academia. However, causal inference from observational data relies on
untestable assumptions about the data-generating process, such as the absence
of unobserved confounders. When these assumptions are violated, causal effect
estimates may become biased, undermining the validity of research findings. In
these contexts, sensitivity analysis plays a crucial role, by enabling data
scientists to assess the robustness of their findings to plausible violations
of unconfoundedness. This paper introduces sensitivity analysis and
demonstrates its practical relevance through a (simulated) data example based
on a use case at Booking.com. We focus our presentation on a recently proposed
method by Chernozhukov et al. (2023), which derives general non-parametric
bounds on biases due to omitted variables, and is fully compatible with (though
not limited to) modern inferential tools of Causal Machine Learning. By
presenting this use case, we aim to raise awareness of sensitivity analysis and
highlight its importance in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨随机异质性模型在模型拟合和偏好异质性分析方面的优势是否能够转化为预测性能的提升。

Method: 使用理论论证和两个案例研究（基于显示选择和陈述选择数据）进行分析。

Result: 随机异质性模型在预测性能和市场份额恢复方面没有优势，唯一的例外是在使用条件分布对估计样本中的相同个体进行预测时。

Conclusion: 随机异质性模型的拟合优势并不能转化为预测优势，特别是在样本外预测场景中。

Abstract: Models allowing for random heterogeneity, such as mixed logit and latent
class, are generally observed to obtain superior model fit and yield detailed
insights into unobserved preference heterogeneity. Using theoretical arguments
and two case studies on revealed and stated choice data, this paper highlights
that these advantages do not translate into any benefits in forecasting,
whether looking at prediction performance or the recovery of market shares. The
only exception arises when using conditional distributions in making
predictions for the same individuals included in the estimation sample, which
obviously precludes any out-of-sample forecasting.

Conclusion: 多维RD设计能够估计更全面的处理效应，提出的估计策略有效利用了多维分配规则，揭示了异质性效应。

Abstract: In the conventional regression-discontinuity (RD) design, the probability
that units receive a treatment changes discontinuously as a function of one
covariate exceeding a threshold or cutoff point. This paper studies an extended
RD design where assignment rules simultaneously involve two or more continuous
covariates. We show that assignment rules with more than one variable allow the
estimation of a more comprehensive set of treatment effects, relaxing in a
research-driven style the local and sometimes limiting nature of univariate RD
designs. We then propose a flexible nonparametric approach to estimate the
multidimensional discontinuity by univariate local linear regression and
compare its performance to existing methods. We present an empirical
application to a large-scale and countrywide financial aid program for
low-income students in Colombia. The program uses a merit-based (academic
achievement) and need-based (wealth index) assignment rule to select students
for the program. We show that our estimation strategy fully exploits the
multidimensional assignment rule and reveals heterogeneous effects along the
treatment boundaries.

Motivation: 解释为什么在长期线下关系形成的社交网络中，错误信息即使被大多数人识别为虚假，仍然能够持续传播而不遭遇公开抵制。

Method: 采用心理博弈论模型，区分个体接收信息后的反应决策（公开支持、保持沉默或公开质疑）和转发决策，考虑感知真实性和社交网络信念对齐的双重影响。

Result: 当个体对同伴压力高度敏感且网络结构极化时，即使多数人私下不相信错误信息，信息仍能广泛传播而不遭遇公开抵制。

Conclusion: 仅提高信息素养不足以遏制错误信息传播，需要同时考虑社交网络结构和同伴压力等社会心理因素。

Abstract: We examine how misinformation spreads in social networks composed of
individuals with long-term offline relationships. Especially, we focus on why
misinformation persists and diffuses despite being recognized by most as false.
In our psychological game theoretical model, each agent who receives a piece of
(mis)information must first decide how to react -- by openly endorsing it,
remaining silent, or openly challenging it. After observing the reactions of
her neighbors who also received the message, the agent then chooses whether to
forward it to others in her own chatroom who have not yet received it. By
distinguishing these two roles, our framework addresses puzzling real-world
phenomena, such as the gap between what individuals privately believe and what
they publicly transmit. A key assumption in our model is that, while perceived
veracity influences decisions, the dominant factor is the alignment between an
agent's beliefs and those of her social network -- a feature characteristic of
communities formed through long-term offline relationships. This dynamic can
lead agents to tacitly accept and even propagate information they privately
judge to be of low credibility. Our results challenge the view that improving
information literacy alone can curb the spread of misinformation. We show that
when agents are highly sensitive to peer pressure and the network exhibits
structural polarization, even if the majority does not genuinely believe in it,
the message still can spread widely without encountering open resistance.

Motivation: 全球有18亿人面临洪水风险，主要集中在东亚和南亚地区。研究旨在了解极端洪水如何重塑有偿劳动力市场结果，特别关注性别差异。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1 SAR卫星数据和JRC全球地表水数据集生成洪水地图，利用多轮劳动力调查数据，估计洪水冲击对性别特定的动态影响。

Result: 男性就业短期减少但很快恢复，女性工作时长出现延迟但持久的下降；男性在第二产业受损最严重并转向第一产业，女性在第三产业受影响最大；婚姻状况和抚养负担进一步塑造了性别差异效应。

Conclusion: 极端洪水对劳动力市场产生显著的性别差异化影响，基础设施和物质资本破坏是部门差异的主要原因，政策需要考虑这些差异来有效应对灾害影响。

Abstract: Catastrophic floods directly risk 1.8 billion lives worldwide, most of whom
are from East and South Asia. How do extreme floods reshape paid labor
outcomes? To answer this, I focus on a 1-in-100 year flood event in India. I
first combine Sentinel-1 SAR with JRC Global Surface Water dataset to generate
flood map. Using information from this map in various rounds of periodic labor
force surveys, I estimate gender-specific dynamic effects of the flood shock.
Key results show that men experienced short-lived reduction in their employment
while women faced a delayed but persistent decline in their working hours. Men
suffered most in secondary sector and increased their participation in primary
sector. Women were hit hardest in the tertiary sector. Such sectoral impacts
could be attributable to disruptions in infrastructure and physical capital.
Moreover, marital status and dependency burden further shape the gender
differential effects of the extreme flood event. Results remain robust under
alternative treatment definitions.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP解决方案因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制，在真实场景中效果有限。

Method: 提出一个框架，使用大语言模型基于政策标准对VRP生成的路线进行批判性评估。生成了400个案例进行标注和评估。

Result: 开源大语言模型识别路由问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型达到86%。证明基于大语言模型的评估可以超越传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 大语言模型评估VRP生成路线可以成为有效且可扩展的评估层，对提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性有重要意义，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like

### [238] [Unified World Models: Memory-Augmented Planning and Foresight for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08713)
*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM是一个统一的内存增强世界模型，将自我中心视觉预测和规划集成在单一多模态自回归骨干中，显著提升具身导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态或新场景中适应性有限。

Method: 提出UniWM统一框架，通过分层记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，在视觉想象的未来状态基础上进行动作决策。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，并在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性进展。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计，可以生成比现有技术更鲁棒的启发式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的启发式设计方法缺乏对算法表现不佳原因的解释和改进建议，导致生成的启发式算法不够鲁棒。

Method: 提出三个简单但有效的想法：(1) 向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2) 解释这些表现不佳的原因；(3) 针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法在最坏情况下性能比FunSearch提升约28倍，平均性能也有所改善，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供表现不佳实例的解释和改进建议，可以显著提升生成启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [240] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离到三个专门组件中，解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM代理存在小错误累积、产生幻觉或失去连贯性的问题。上下文管理是核心瓶颈，冗长的历史记录导致代理忽略关键证据或被无关信息干扰。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个专门组件：(1)主代理执行推理和工具使用，(2)元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预，(3)上下文管理器维护简洁、相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个挑战性基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化组件有效解决了长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并提供了测试时扩展和训练后流水线来进一步提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [241] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过控制实验揭示了人类和AI在文学风格评估中存在的系统性亲人类归因偏见，AI模型的偏见程度是人类的2.5倍，且这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是归因偏见对评估的影响。

Method: 研究1比较人类参与者和AI模型对Queneau作品与GPT-4生成版本的评估（盲测、准确标注、反事实标注）；研究2测试AI评估者和创作者14×14矩阵中的偏见泛化。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点偏见（2.5倍更强）；研究2确认偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在（+25.8个百分点）。归因标签导致评估标准反转。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的归因偏见倾向。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA（目标-计划-行动）评估框架，包含五个评估指标，能够系统性地覆盖智能体失败情况，在基准数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统性的评估范式来评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行整个操作循环中的表现，覆盖各种类型的智能体失败。

Method: 基于智能体操作循环（目标-计划-行动）构建评估框架，包含五个评估指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度。

Result: 在TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集和生产级数据智能体上的实验表明，该框架能覆盖所有智能体错误，LLM评估与人工标注高度一致（80%-95%），并能准确定位错误（86%一致率）。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架提供了一种系统化的智能体评估方法，能够全面覆盖智能体失败、支持自动化评估，并为性能改进提供针对性指导。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ReviewerToo框架，通过AI辅助同行评审来补充人类判断，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同行评审中存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助提高评审的系统性和一致性。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准，可部分或完全集成到实际会议工作流程中。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上，GPT-OSS-120B模型达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，AI生成的评审质量高于人类平均水平，但在方法新颖性和理论贡献评估方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家，为构建系统化的混合同行评审系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [244] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于博弈论的对齐框架GTAlign，将用户-LLM交互建模为战略博弈，在推理和训练阶段都考虑双方利益，以改善回答质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就等于最大化用户福利，但实践中经常失败，模型可能过度澄清或生成冗长推理，而用户偏好简洁答案，这种情形类似于囚徒困境。

Method: 在推理时，模型将用户-LLM交互视为战略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利，选择互利行动；在训练时引入相互福利奖励强化合作响应；还提出了基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 广泛实验表明，GTAlign在多样化任务中相比基线方法显著提升了推理效率、回答质量和相互福利。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论决策机制实现了用户和LLM的互利对齐，为解决传统对齐方法的局限性提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了LM Fight Arena框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让大型多模态模型相互对战，评估它们在实时对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉它们在实时对抗环境中的真实性能表现。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同的角色以确保公平比较，通过解释游戏画面和状态数据来选择行动。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可重复且客观的评估框架，能够评估LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分记忆性回答和推理性回答来检测LLM的数据污染问题，准确率达到93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染导致LLM评估不可靠，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高分，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 提取37个特征，包括表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（注意力专业化、电路动态、激活流模式），使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例完美检测，模糊案例76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性在超越传统表面指标推进LLM评估方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估检索增强生成(RAG)管道的基准，包含多模态数据测试集、短语级召回指标、幻觉检测方法，并比较了开源和闭源管道的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是处理多模态和跨文档信息的能力。

Method: 创建了93个多模态问题数据集，开发了短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉分类器，评估了2个开源和4个闭源RAG管道。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上表现差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的整体性能，揭示了闭源模型在多模态处理上的优势，为RAG系统开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体中心知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据进行轻量级索引，相比其他结构化RAG系统减少94%的token消耗。系统通过提取查询中的提示实体，在知识图谱中进行可扩展的多跳关联检索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，人类利用提示激活实体中心的记忆痕迹进行复杂的多跳回忆。作者希望借鉴这一机制，开发一个更高效的实体中心知识图谱检索框架。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及对应元数据；检索阶段首先提取查询中的提示实体，然后在知识图谱中进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试上的广泛评估表明，EcphoryRAG达到了新的最先进水平，将平均精确匹配(EM)分数从0.392提高到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果验证了实体-提示-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中的有效性，为高效的知识检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题，显著提升了科学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究框架虽然能协调外部工具进行复杂多步科学推理，但仍存在上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等问题，需要更有效的推理支持机制。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕获执行来源。每个图都有层原生相关性函数，广度使用种子锚定语义扩散，深度使用因果语义路径匹配和可靠性加权。通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上取得有竞争力的性能。使用开源系统InternAgent的日志文件，在HLE上的准确率提高了7.7%，在GPQA上提高了6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch作为深度研究系统的补充，能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重构答案，显著提升了科学推理能力。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)新范式，通过图神经网络提取语义条件并自适应融合，显著优于传统的prefix-tuning方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有prefix-tuning方法简单拼接知识嵌入和文本输入，忽略了知识图谱的丰富关系语义，给LLM带来隐式推理负担

Method: 包含语义图模块（使用GNN提取上下文感知语义条件）和条件自适应融合模块（通过参数化投影器调制文本嵌入）

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试中显著优于prefix-tuning和其他强基线方法

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接有效的信号，实现更准确鲁棒的知识推理

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLMs旅行规划能力时，往往无法充分评估计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，开发统一奖励评估器，测试多种方法包括测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM作为评判基准；强化学习在基础模型上普遍提高了行程可行性，获得更高的统一奖励分数。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估这些模型在评分方面的能力，特别是在检测错误、判断严重程度和分配公平分数方面的表现。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena数据集，引入智能体工作流程来提取参考解决方案并自动推导问题特定的评分标准，实现多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能够可靠地标记错误解决方案，但在部分分数分配方面存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人类评分一致性和部分分数处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 智能体工作流程能够提高LLMs在证明评分方面的准确性和一致性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志等资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号系统和LLM的优势来修复正则表达式ReDoS漏洞，解决了现有方法在精度和泛化性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛应用，但其普遍性使系统面临ReDoS漏洞。现有修复方法存在权衡：符号系统精确但无法处理未见模式，LLM泛化能力强但可靠性不足。

Method: LRR框架将问题识别与修复过程解耦：首先用确定性符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，然后调用LLM为隔离的片段生成语义等效的修复。

Result: 该混合架构成功解决了基于规则修复无法处理的复杂案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比现有最优方法提高了15.4个百分点。

Conclusion: LRR为自动修复问题提供了经过验证的方法论，有效结合了LLM的泛化能力和符号系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，通过将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，在长序列任务和分布偏移下提升GUI代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将过往轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来提升跨界面泛化能力。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、合成任务、执行轨迹和验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长序列和分布偏移下持续提升成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理的泛化能力，通过低成本数据飞轮实现记忆扩展，在保持细粒度视觉信息的同时显著降低上下文成本。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

TL;DR: 本研究通过整合精神分析和MBTI人格理论，构建了包含自我意识、潜意识和前意识的人工意识模型，以及16种MBTI人格角色，在10种情境下测试其决策过程，结果显示能较好模拟人类意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽在多个领域取得进展，但由于幻觉问题难以模拟人类意识。本研究旨在通过结合精神分析和人格理论来构建更接近人类认知的人工意识系统。

Method: 基于精神分析理论开发三种人工意识（自我意识、潜意识、前意识），设计16种MBTI人格角色，包含需求、状态、记忆等属性。在10种情境下测试决策过程，通过问卷调查、ChatGPT三级分类和定性评估三种方式进行分析。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明模型能较好地模拟人类意识，但不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不够显著。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论元素开发的模型能够构建更直观、适应性更强的人工意识系统，为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: MEC³O是一个多专家共识系统，通过将LLMs分配到不同复杂度类别并让专家进行结构化辩论，使用加权共识机制整合预测，在代码复杂度预测任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码复杂度预测任务中表现不均衡，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，而是各自在某些类别上有优势。

Method: 提出MEC³O多专家共识系统，基于LLMs在不同复杂度类别的性能进行专家分配，提供类别专业化指令，让专家进行结构化辩论，并通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线方法准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%，在macro-F1上平均超越GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini在F1分数上表现相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、在推理时控制流式文本到图像模型的方法，通过特征空间目标和正交随机扰动来增强生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样来发现多样的模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩展，并引入时间调度的随机扰动，该扰动被投影为与生成流正交，以在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持了图像质量和对齐性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上显示能单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边缘分布，为生成质量的鲁棒保持提供了原理性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否考虑医疗的社会性特征，特别是健康差异和偏见如何影响生成的医疗建议。

Method: 通过模拟不同患者档案（性别、年龄、种族）提出一系列医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者获得的建议可读性更低、更复杂，交叉群体中差异更显著。

Conclusion: 鉴于用户对这些模型的信任日益增加，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to

the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度问题，但对LLMs和LRMs在有限上下文窗口下的空间计算限制理解不足，需要更严格的PSPACE完全问题来评估计算能力。

Method: 通过双重指数空间探索构建包含超过百万个正则表达式实例的标注数据集，使用严格过滤过程建立基准，并对6个LLMs和5个LRMs进行广泛评估。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估高级推理能力提供了新框架，展示了PSPACE完全问题作为更严格计算能力评估标准的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Method: 构建包含四个关键组件的系统：感知系统将环境感知转换为有意义表示；推理系统通过思维链、思维树等技术制定计划、适应反馈和评估行动；记忆系统通过短期和长期机制保留知识；执行系统将内部决策转化为具体行动。

Result: 研究表明，集成这些系统可以产生更强大和通用的软件机器人，能够模拟人类认知过程，实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 通过整合感知、推理、记忆和执行系统，可以开发出能够模拟人类认知过程的智能代理，实现更高级的自主和智能行为。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可调节语言模型内部表示的新框架，通过局部性调节参数在可解释的局部化编码和高效的分布式编码之间连续调整，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在需要透明度的监管领域同时满足可解释性和高性能的需求，提供从规则化到泛化编码的连续调节能力。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过数学证明建立注意力集中在语义相关块上的阈值条件。

Result: 证明了当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，模型注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度，误差可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现小语言模型可以通过学习底层规则而非统计学习来解决演绎推理任务，揭示了归纳头在逻辑推理中实现规则补全和规则链式推理的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型解决逻辑推理问题的内部机制，这些机制目前仍未被充分研究。

Method: 使用小语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，特别关注归纳头的作用。

Result: 发现小语言模型能够学习底层规则来执行演绎推理，归纳头在规则补全和规则链式推理中发挥核心作用。

Conclusion: 语言模型可以通过学习规则而非统计模式来解决逻辑推理任务，归纳头是实现逻辑推理的关键计算机制。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

*Augustin Delecluse,Pierre Schaus,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文在约束规划中形式化了序列变量，以解决传统后继变量模型在处理可选访问和插入启发式时的局限性，并在Dial-a-Ride问题上展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于后继变量的CP模型无法有效处理车辆路径问题中的可选访问或基于插入的启发式方法，这限制了CP在VRP中的应用。

Method: 形式化定义了序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，实现了支持可选访问和插入启发式的数据结构，并设计了专门用于序列变量和车辆路径的全局约束。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模过程，并在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了具有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为车辆路径问题提供了更直观、声明性的建模框架，克服了传统CP模型的局限性，支持更灵活的启发式方法。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和协调工作流程的特点，非常适合从能够适应上下文并自动化复杂重复任务的智能代理中受益。虽然LLM在单个任务上表现出色，但单独使用无法充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLM配备外部工具和反馈机制，使其能够驱动表现出不同程度自主性的系统，从半自动化工作流程到能够管理复杂过程的自适应代理。

Result: 论文回顾了此类LLM驱动的代理系统设计，突出了关键应用，讨论了规划和工具使用的评估方法。

Conclusion: 论文概述了错误级联、工具使用效率和健康IT集成等挑战，强调了在放射学中构建LLM驱动代理系统的潜力和发展方向。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出使用API优先、可编程的湖仓作为安全设计的基础，通过数据分支和声明式环境来支持AI代理工作流，确保可重现性和可观测性，同时减少攻击面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发了关于信任、正确性和治理的担忧。需要为代理工作流提供安全的设计基础。

Method: 使用Bauplan作为案例研究，展示数据分支和声明式环境如何自然扩展到代理，并通过受证明携带代码启发的正确性检查来修复数据管道。

Result: 原型演示表明，不受信任的AI代理可以在生产数据上安全操作，并展示了实现完全代理化湖仓的路径。

Conclusion: API优先、可编程的湖仓为安全设计的代理工作流提供了合适的抽象，能够实现可重现性和可观测性，同时减少攻击面。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

*Margarita Belova,Jiaxin Xiao,Shikhar Tuli,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，通过从非结构化文本语料库中提取高质量知识图谱来解决神经符号AI的可扩展性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号AI领域近30年来未能实现其承诺，主要因为现有框架难以扩展，且神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠KG仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个微小的图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量KG。GraphMERT及其等效KG形成一个模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号KG用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的KG获得69.8%的FActScore，而32B参数的基线LLM仅获得40.2%的FActScore。GraphMERT KG还达到68.8%的ValidityScore，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT+KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线具有优越的符号表示能力。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个信息学奥赛级别编程问题的基准测试，具有高质量测试用例和离线评估系统，用于评估LLM的编程能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在缺乏高难度问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面和可访问的评估工具。

Method: 从72个官方信息学奥赛中收集403个专家策划的问题，每个问题平均60个测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行比较。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，但仍落后于顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位）；开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达60百分位。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先精确问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### [273] [Blackwell without Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08709)
*Maxwell Rosenthal*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全无先验的实验模型，通过比较决策者在观察不同实验输出后的最大最小期望效用来评估实验的信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Blackwell排序对实验信息量的比较过于严格，许多实验对无法比较。本文旨在建立一个更宽松但实用的信息量比较标准。

Method: 基于决策理论框架，定义了一个实验比另一个实验更稳健信息丰富的条件：当且仅当信息量较少的实验是信息量较多实验的线性变换时成立。

Result: 证明了该排序标准比Blackwell排序更宽松，允许更多实验对进行比较，且该标准被Blackwell排序蕴含但不蕴含Blackwell排序。

Conclusion: 提出的稳健信息量排序为实验比较提供了一个实用且理论严谨的替代标准，扩展了可比较实验对的范围。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully prior-free model of experimentation in which the
decision maker observes the entire distribution of signals generated by a known
experiment under an unknown distribution of the state of the world. One
experiment is robustly more informative than another if the decision maker's
maxmin expected utility after observing the output of the former is always at
least her maxmin expected utility after observing the latter. We show that this
ranking holds if and only if the less informative experiment is a linear
transformation of the more informative experiment; equivalently, the null space
of the more informative experiment is a subset of the null space of the less
informative experiment. Our criterion is implied by Blackwell's order but does
not imply it, and we show by example that our ranking admits strictly more
comparable pairs of experiments than the classical ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arrow不可能定理是重要的社会选择理论结果，但之前D'Antoni的工作仅限于严格偏好情况。本文旨在将该定理与偏好循环的等价关系推广到包含弱偏好的完整情况。

Method: 通过显式构造导致偏好循环的偏好配置文件，将D'Antoni的方法论推广到包含弱偏好的情况。

Result: 成功证明了在考虑弱偏好的完整情况下，Arrow不可能定理可以等价地表述为矛盾偏好循环问题。

Conclusion: 该方法论不仅建立了Arrow定理与偏好循环的等价关系，还可能为其他领域（如金钱泵、荷兰赌、非传递博弈等）的偏好循环研究提供新的见解。

Abstract: Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is a seminal result of Social Choice Theory
that demonstrates the impossibility of ranked-choice decision-making processes
to jointly satisfy a number of intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints.
The theorem is often described as a generalisation of Condorcet's Paradox,
wherein pairwise majority voting may fail to jointly satisfy the same
constraints due to the occurrence of elections that result in contradictory
preference cycles. However, a formal proof of this relationship has been
limited to D'Antoni's work, which applies only to the strict preference case,
i.e., where indifference between alternatives is not allowed. In this paper, we
generalise D'Antoni's methodology to prove in full (i.e., accounting for weak
preferences) that Arrow's Impossibility Theorem can be equivalently stated in
terms of contradictory preference cycles. This methodology involves explicitly
constructing profiles that lead to preference cycles. Using this framework, we
also prove a number of additional facts regarding social welfare functions. As
a result, this methodology may yield further insights into the nature of
preference cycles in other domains e.g., Money Pumps, Dutch Books, Intransitive
Games, etc.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 提出一个考虑个体损失厌恶的新福利分析框架，将收入变化和绝对收入纳入政策评估，开发双变量随机优势标准来排序政策结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室和人口调查显示个体在评估自身状况时会关注收益和损失，且损失比收益影响更大，这种损失厌恶会影响政治选择，因此需要新的福利分析框架。

Method: 开发多个双变量随机优势标准，考虑收入变化和绝对收入的联合分布特征，将损失厌恶、不平等厌恶等偏好转化为可通过样本数据检验的函数不等式。

Result: 使用康涅狄格州收入支持实验数据进行概念和方法演示，验证了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的新福利分析框架能够更全面地评估政策结果，考虑了个体的损失厌恶和收入不平等问题，为政策制定提供更科学的评估工具。

Abstract: Strong empirical evidence from laboratory experiments, and more recently from
population surveys, shows that individuals, when evaluating their situations,
pay attention to whether they experience gains or losses, with losses weighing
more heavily than gains. The electorate's loss aversion, in turn, influences
politicians' choices. We propose a new framework for welfare analysis of policy
outcomes that, in addition to the traditional focus on post-policy incomes,
also accounts for individuals' gains and losses resulting from policies. We
develop several bivariate stochastic dominance criteria for ranking policy
outcomes that are sensitive to features of the joint distribution of
individuals' income changes and absolute incomes. The main social objective
assumes that individuals are loss averse with respect to income gains and
losses, inequality averse with respect to absolute incomes, and hold varying
preferences regarding the association between incomes and income changes. We
translate these and other preferences into functional inequalities that can be
tested using sample data. The concepts and methods are illustrated using data
from an income support experiment conducted in Connecticut.
