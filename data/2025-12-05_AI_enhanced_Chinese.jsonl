Drawing on concepts of wicked problems and systems thinking, we propose a theory of change represented as a 'turtle model' that embraces the diversity of citizens' values and knowledge to highlight multiple avenues of transformation. As quadruple helix innovation and governance hubs, cities can be hotspots for food system transformations. We illustrate this for Dublin, Ireland, where local citizens' value-based food identities were galvanized to activate ecological awareness and promote sustainable seafood consumption. Within this democratic food governance framework, approaches such as open science, transdisciplinarity, and citizen engagement are fit-for-purpose to engage diverse food actors from government, industry, academia, and civil society in shared dialogue and action to transform food systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c11\u4e3b\u98df\u54c1\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\"\u6d77\u9f9f\u6a21\u578b\"\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57ce\u5e02\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56db\u87ba\u65cb\u521b\u65b0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u6c11\u4ef7\u503c\u8ba4\u540c\u63a8\u52a8\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5411\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u5143\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u68d8\u624b\u95ee\u9898\"\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7279\u5f81", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u6d77\u9f9f\u6a21\u578b\"\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68d8\u624b\u95ee\u9898\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u4ee5\u57ce\u5e02\u4e3a\u56db\u87ba\u65cb\u521b\u65b0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u516c\u6c11\u53c2\u4e0e\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u4ee5\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u90fd\u67cf\u6797\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u516c\u6c11\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u98df\u54c1\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6001\u610f\u8bc6\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6d77\u9c9c\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6c11\u4e3b\u98df\u54c1\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6c11\u4e3b\u98df\u54c1\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u516c\u6c11\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u653f\u5e9c\u3001\u4ea7\u4e1a\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u6c11\u95f4\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u591a\u5143\u884c\u52a8\u8005\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u52a8\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u578b"}}

Prior literature has emphasized the tension between imitation risks from disclosure and scientists' preferences for publication. This study examines an additional managerial consideration: the value of follow-on research conducted by external scientists building upon firms' publications. Using data on U.S. public firms' scientific publications from 1990 to 2012, and a novel instrumental variable based on quasi-random journal issue assignment, I find that accumulation of follow-on research is associated with increased subsequent scientific investments, improved patenting outcomes, and greater employee retention by the originating firms. Benefits are more pronounced for firms with complementary assets and those operating in emerging research fields. Beyond serving as direct input into innovation, follow-on research provides external validation of internal research programs, helping managers allocate resources under conditions of scientific uncertainty.

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B.

However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance.

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLas Vegas\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u6548\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u7b49\u5b8c\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u627e\u5230\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002\u800cLas Vegas\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b49\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7687\u540e\u968f\u673a\u653e\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6Las Vegas\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u6548\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u968fN\u589e\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927N\u503c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u662fN\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u5355\u4e2a\u53ca\u65f6\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002"}}

In this study, the Durbin-Hausman panel cointegration test is used to analyze the cointegration relationship between the variables and the Panel AMG estimator is used to estimate the long-run coefficients. The results of the AMG estimator show that military expenditures and industrial production index have a negative effect on sustainable development in NATO countries, while foreign direct investments have a positive effect. The impact of primary energy consumption is negative and less significant than the other negative impacts. The study also analyzes how the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. This analysis reveals the significant differences in the direction, significance, and coefficient size of the relationship among different countries.

The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively.

Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A.

In this work, we present RippleBench-Maker, an automatic tool for generating Q&A datasets that allow for the measurement of ripple effects in any model-editing task. RippleBench-Maker builds on a Wikipedia-based RAG pipeline (WikiRAG) to generate multiple-choice questions at varying semantic distances from the target concept (e.g., the knowledge being unlearned). Using this framework, we construct RippleBench-Bio, a benchmark derived from the WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Paper) dataset, a common unlearning benchmark. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art unlearning methods and find that all exhibit non-trivial accuracy drops on topics increasingly distant from the unlearned knowledge, each with distinct propagation profiles.

The study uses import, export and net export data for 2023. In addition, exchange rate-adjusted versions of the data were also included to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Spectral clustering method is used to group the export performance of cities. The optimum number of clusters was determined by the Eigen-Gap method. The Silhouette coefficient method was used to evaluate the clustering performance. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the data set was optimally separated into 3 clusters. Spectral-clustering analysis based on export performance showed that 42% of the provinces are in the \"Low\", 33% in the \"Medium\" and 25% in the \"High\" export performance category.

A lightweight agent supervises retrieval, refinement, or combination of results across both paths when confidence is low. This design maintains header hierarchies, time labels, and units, ensuring that returned values are faithful to the original cells and straightforward to verify. Evaluated on multi-header corporate balance sheets, a heavily merged World Bank workbook, and diverse public datasets, SQuARE consistently surpasses single-strategy baselines and ChatGPT-4o on both retrieval precision and end-to-end answer accuracy while keeping latency predictable.

Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u79d1\u62a4\u7406\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u7ea7\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5357\u867d\u6709\"\u7ea2\u65d7\u5f81\"\u8b66\u793a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u751f\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5168\u548c\u75c7\u72b6\u591a\u6837\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u6f0f\u8bca\u6216\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5f53\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u6392\u5668-\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e03\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e2d\u592e\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u7531\u534f\u8c03\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u752890\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5355LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff08Qwen-30B\u3001GPT-OSS-20B\u3001Qwen-14B\u3001Qwen-8B\u3001Llama-3.1-8B\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ARDL method is preferred in the analysis using annual data for the period 1990-2021. In addition, an interaction term is added to the model to determine the effectiveness of renewable energy sources. The results show that military expenditures have a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.260 and 0.196, respectively. Moreover, renewable energy use has a statistically significant negative impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of -0.119 and -0.120, respectively. GDP has a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.162 and 0.193, respectively. Although population growth does not have a statistically significant impact in the short run, it is found to increase CO2 emissions in the long run with a coefficient of 0.095. Moreover, the interaction term shows that renewable energy use reduces the environmental impact of military expenditures in Turkiye in the short and long run with coefficients of -0.130 and -0.140, respectively.

We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities.

Current theories of rich feature learning effects revolve around networks with one or two trainable layers or deep linear networks. Furthermore, even under such limiting settings, predictions often appear in the form of high-dimensional non-linear equations, which require computationally intensive numerical solutions. Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge. Here, we propose a powerful heuristic route for predicting the data and width scales at which various patterns of feature learning emerge. This form of scale analysis is considerably simpler than such exact theories and reproduces the scaling exponents of various known results. In addition, we make novel predictions on complex toy architectures, such as three-layer non-linear networks and attention heads, thus extending the scope of first-principle theories of deep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u7f6e\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42/\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c42\u6216\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5404\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u8bba\u7b80\u5355\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u590d\u73b0\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u590d\u73b0\u5404\u79cd\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u73a9\u5177\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u4e09\u5c42\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff09\u505a\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Conversational medical assistants must avoid unsafe compliance without over-refusing benign queries. We present an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that applies Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine models against domain-specific safety signals. Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases. We also perform ablation studies to identify when self-evaluation is reliable and when external or finetuned judges are necessary to maximize performance gains.

However, most existing systems are PV-only and cannot provide backup power during grid failures. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of 377,726 households in Indianapolis, US, quantifying how power outages influence the installation of PV-only systems between 2014 and 2023. Using a two-part econometric panel model, we estimate the causal effect of power outage exposure and project future risks under a middle of the road climate scenario (RCP 4.5). We find that each additional hour of annual outage duration per household lowers the new-installation rate by 0.012 percentage points per year, equivalent to a 31% decline relative to the historical mean (2014-2023). With outage duration and frequency projected to double by 2040, these results reveal a potential vicious cycle between grid unreliability and slower decarbonization, calling for policies that integrate grid resilience and clean-energy goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u505c\u7535\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4f\u5b85\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u7387\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7535\u7f51\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e0e\u51cf\u7f13\u8131\u78b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6076\u6027\u5faa\u73af", "motivation": "\u4f4f\u5b85\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4f4f\u5b85\u8131\u78b3\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5907\u7528\u7535\u6e90\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u505c\u7535\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u51b3\u7b56", "method": "\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u6ce2\u5229\u65af377,726\u6237\u5bb6\u5ead\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u505c\u7535\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RCP 4.5\u4e2d\u7b49\u6c14\u5019\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u98ce\u9669", "result": "\u6bcf\u6237\u6bcf\u5e74\u505c\u7535\u65f6\u95f4\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u65b0\u5b89\u88c5\u7387\u6bcf\u5e74\u964d\u4f4e0.012\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u5747\u503c\uff082014-2023\u5e74\uff09\u4e0b\u964d31%\u3002\u505c\u7535\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9884\u8ba1\u52302040\u5e74\u5c06\u7ffb\u500d", "conclusion": "\u7535\u7f51\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e0e\u51cf\u7f13\u8131\u78b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6076\u6027\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u6574\u5408\u7535\u7f51\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u653f\u7b56"}}

We propose ClusterFusion, a hybrid framework that instead treats the LLM as the clustering core, guided by lightweight embedding methods. The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains.

These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively.

Although embedding vector spaces are widely used to represent semantic closeness and are promising for analyzing text difficulty, the abundance of embedding methods creates a challenge in selecting the most suitable method. This study proposes the Educational Cone Model, which is a geometric framework based on the assumption that easier texts are less diverse (focusing on fundamental concepts), whereas harder texts are more diverse. This assumption leads to a cone-shaped distribution in the embedding space regardless of the embedding method used. The model frames the evaluation of embeddings as an optimization problem with the aim of detecting structured difficulty-based patterns. By designing specific loss functions, efficient closed-form solutions are derived that avoid costly computation. Empirical tests on real-world datasets validated the model's effectiveness and speed in identifying the embedding spaces that are best aligned with difficulty-annotated educational texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u7b80\u5355\u6587\u672c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9525\u5f62\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f17\u591a\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5047\u8bbe\u7b80\u5355\u6587\u672c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff08\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9525\u5f62\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u6559\u80b2\u6587\u672c\u6700\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time.

The architecture you train with is the architecture you deploy. This assumption constrains the community from selecting architectures that may have desirable efficiency or design properties due to difficulties with optimization. We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \\textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \\footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness. By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u80af\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5426\u5b9a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u80af\u5b9a\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u80af\u5b9a\u524d\u4ef6\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9047\u5230\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u53cd\u4f8b\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u524d\u63d0\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u8c2c\u8bef\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u80af\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5426\u5b9a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\"\u5426\u5b9a\u524d\u4ef6\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc1\u4f2a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u80af\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u65e0\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5426\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

We demonstrate a deep conditional-generative machine learning approach for the modelling of realistic activity schedules depending on input labels such as an individual's age, employment status, or other information relevant to their scheduling. We combine (i) a structured latent generative approach, with (ii) a conditional approach, through a novel Conditional VAE architecture. This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels. This comparison highlights the usefulness of explicitly modelling the randomness of complex and diverse human behaviours using deep generative approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Conditional VAE\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\uff09\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u65e5\u7a0b\u5b89\u6392\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b89\u6392\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c5e\u6027\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6d3b\u52a8\u65e5\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9700\u6c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Conditional VAE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u65e5\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u548c\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0e\u7eaf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u65e5\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u4e49\u52a1\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u57f9\u517b\u6301\u4e45\u4e60\u60ef\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u5143\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u6743\u8861\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7406\u535a\u5f08\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7f8e\u5fb7\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u4f46\u89c4\u8303\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u699c\u6837\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7f8e\u5fb7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4ef7\u503c\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u7eb3\u5165\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4f24\u5bb3\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7f8e\u5fb7\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u8d28\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u89c4\u8303\u6f14\u5316\uff1b4) \u5c06\u591a\u5143\u4f26\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5851\u9020\u4f26\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u67e5\u6216\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u62a5\u8f6c\u5411\u7279\u8d28\u603b\u7ed3\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7684\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u9053\u5fb7\u6743\u8861\u7684\u660e\u786e\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e60\u60ef\uff08\u7f8e\u5fb7\uff09\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Four models are evaluated: logistic regression, a linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and a random forest.

We present a deep learning framework for the quantitative regression of pIC50 values from molecular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using fine-tuned variants of ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model. Leveraging a large-scale consensus dataset of 177,092 compounds, we systematically evaluate two pre-training strategies-Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Token Regression (MTR)-under stratified data splits and sample weighting to address severe activity imbalance which only 2.1% are active. Our approach outperforms classical baselines Random Predictor in both regression accuracy and virtual screening utility, and has competitive performance compared to Random Forest, achieving high enrichment factor EF@1% 17.4 and precision Precision@1% 37.4 among top-ranked predictions. The resulting model, validated through rigorous ablation and hyperparameter studies, provides a robust, ready-to-deploy tool for prioritizing TDP1 inhibitors for experimental testing.

Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $\u03ba> 0$.

Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd510\u79cd\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8003\u8651IID\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523077.08%\u81ea\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c67.96%\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bReLU\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c40%\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u8fbe\u523070.09%\u81ea\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c54.79%\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eCalFAT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLU\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

MSME consists of three stages: (1) Knowledge Preparation, where relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified; (2) Expert Reasoning, involving three specialized modules-Knowledge Expert distills salient facts and reasons from a knowledge perspective, Label Expert refines stance labels and reasons accordingly, and Pragmatic Expert detects rhetorical cues such as irony to infer intent from a pragmatic angle; (3) Decision Aggregation, where a Meta-Judge integrates all expert analyses to produce the final stance prediction.

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD. Finally, inspired by our findings in the case of linear regression, we consider widespread LLMs augmented with initial guess capabilities, and show that their performance is improved on a semantic similarity task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u591a\u5934\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08LSA\uff09\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08GD\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86yq-LSA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u96f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u662f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u5934LSA\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u96f6\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55\u591a\u5934LSA\u5d4c\u5165\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\uff09\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660eICL\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u5934\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fayq-LSA\uff08\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4byq\u7684\u5355\u5934LSA\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6cdb\u5316\uff09\uff1b4. \u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b5. \u5c06\u53d1\u73b0\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u591a\u5934LSA\u5934\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b2. \u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u591a\u5934LSA\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b3. yq-LSA\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b4. \u589e\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5ICL\u548cGD\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002yq-LSA\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86LSA\u4e0eGD\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3ICL\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent. This proposal explores several approaches to dealing with these unsolved problems and enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of dense reward construction in different RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u6216\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u7b49\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u6784\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u6784\u9020\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u6784\u9020\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines.

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u5728RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\"\u63d0\u793a\"\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5728\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6c42\u89e3\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u5408\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u81ea\u4e3e\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u5747\u8861\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5143\u683c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u2014\u2014\u6700\u4f73\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671d\u5411\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5728RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u3002"}}

This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoEdit substantially outperforms existing knowledge editing methods on the proposed LF-Edit task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLF-Edit\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMRLF-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1EvoEdit\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e0eLLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLF-Edit\u4efb\u52a1\u548cMRLF-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b16,835\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u8bf7\u6c42\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1EvoEdit\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5408\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u4fe1\u606f", "result": "EvoEdit\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LF-Edit\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u56db\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02", "conclusion": "LF-Edit\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cEvoEdit\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit.

From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens.

Context compression aims to alleviate this computational bottleneck while retaining critical semantic information. However, existing approaches often fall short: explicit methods may compromise local detail, whereas implicit methods can suffer from positional biases, information degradation, or an inability to capture long-range semantic dependencies. We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency.

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios.

However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions.

We conduct evaluations on 11 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning reasoning, reading comprehension, code generation, and instruction following, we find that ADAPT matches or slightly improves average downstream performance relative to the best static mixture, while using fewer effective training tokens and reallocating budget toward harder, benchmark-aligned tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADAPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650token\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u52a1\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u91cd\u901a\u5e38\u624b\u52a8\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u6309\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u7528\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "ADAPT\u7ef4\u62a4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728token\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u5c06\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6709\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ea610\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u75281%\u30015%\u300110%\u7684\u76d1\u7763token\u9884\u7b97\uff0cADAPT\u572811\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u9759\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3token\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9884\u7b97\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ADAPT\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30WebAgents\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0825k-150k tokens\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u4ece40-50%\u964d\u81f3<10%\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u9677\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u4e22\u5931\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u6570\u5b57\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684WebAgents\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30WebAgents\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\u4ece\u6269\u5c55\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u9896\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u521b\u5efa25k-150k tokens\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b3. \u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, o4-mini\uff09\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0fRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "1. \u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece\u57fa\u7ebf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u768440-50%\u964d\u81f3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db310%\uff1b2. \u8be6\u7ec6\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u9677\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u4e22\u5931\u539f\u59cb\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff1b3. \u9690\u5f0fRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72WebAgents\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u3002\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5f53\u524dWebAgents\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix.

However, existing benchmarks are result-oriented and fail to systematically evaluate the legal intelligence of large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of legal GI. To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals. We believe LexGenius can assess the legal intelligence abilities of LLMs and enhance legal GI development.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGovBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cDataGovAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5f97\u5206\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u6216\u9ad8\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u2014\u2014\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faGovBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b150\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u53cd\u5411\u76ee\u6807\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faDataGovAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528Planner-Executor-Evaluator\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6c99\u76d2\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDataGovAgent\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u5f97\u5206(ATS)\u4ece39.7\u523054.9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c1177.9%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "GovBench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0cDataGovAgent\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases.

Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDRL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DDRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c1\u4e07\u6b21\u53cc\u76f2\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDDRL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "DDRL\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u951a\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

While recent advances in language models have shown promise in this direction, existing solutions often rely on large-scale closed-source models that suffer from high inference costs, limited transparency, and lack of adaptability for lightweight deployment. In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation.

The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation.

Understanding where and how these subtle failures occur in an application relies on evaluation methods known as \\textit{evals}. Prior work focuses on defining new eval methods or benchmark datasets for specific tasks. However, neither helps a software team with a task-specific FM application when there is no metric or dataset. The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering. A preliminary evaluation on the quality of our selected evals shows 93\\% and 90\\% accuracy respectively.

We present SignRoundV2, a post-training quantization framework that is highly effective even without mixed-precision. SignRoundV2 introduces (1) a fast sensitivity metric that combines gradient information with quantization-induced deviations to guide layer-wise bit allocation, and (2) a lightweight pre-tuning search for quantization scales to improve extremely low-bit quantization.

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief.

Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement. Extensive experiments validate our approach's effectiveness on both base models and reasoning-enhanced models.

Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework consistently improves editing reliability and generalization under real-world evaluations, while better preserving locality and pre-trained capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEdit-then-Consolidate\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TPSFT\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEdit-then-Consolidate\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528TPSFT\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u76ee\u6807\u9650\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Edit-then-Consolidate\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edfSmartAlert\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8615%\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8840\u6db2\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u4f46\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u60a3\u8005\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u533b\u7597\u6210\u672c\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u7528\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8b66\u62a5\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u7597\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bdSmartAlert\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u57288\u4e2a\u6025\u75c7\u62a4\u7406\u5355\u5143\u76849270\u4f8b\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u5168\u8840\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "SmartAlert\u663e\u793a\u540e52\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185CBC\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b21\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff081.54 vs 1.82\uff0cp<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c1115%\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6b21\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u5c40\u65e0\u4e0d\u826f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u5408\u5468\u5bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u51c6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\u5b9e\u65f6\u6362\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684PlayerRank\u6307\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u75b2\u52b3\u548c\u6218\u672f\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u57282018\u4e16\u754c\u676f\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8db3\u7403\u6362\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u89c9\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bd5\u56fe\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06PlayerRank\u6307\u6807\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e0a\u573a\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2. \u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff08\u75b2\u52b3\uff09\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u6218\u672f\u89d2\u8272\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u7eaa\u5f8b\u98ce\u9669\uff09\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u6362\u4eba\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff1b4. \u6784\u5efa\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u57282018\u4e16\u754c\u676f\u5df4\u897f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff1a1. \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u52a0\u5e03\u91cc\u57c3\u5c14\u00b7\u70ed\u82cf\u65af\u6362\u4eba\uff09\uff1b2. \u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff08\"\u6cd5\u683c\u7eb3\u6096\u8bba\"\u9632\u5b88\u98ce\u9669\uff09\uff1b3. \u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\"\u5362\u5361\u5e93\u6096\u8bba\"\uff08\u52a9\u653b\u63a9\u76d6\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models. This makes it both a resource -- the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for Italian to date -- and a framework for sustainable, community-driven evaluation.

By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSTeP-Diff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5efa\u7b51\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\u4fbf\u643a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6613\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTeP-Diff\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528DeepONet\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u90e8\u7f7259\u4e2a\u81ea\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fbf\u643a\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd0\u884c14\u5929\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728MAE\u63d0\u534789.12%\uff0cRMSE\u63d0\u534782.30%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534725.00%\u3002\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660eSTeP-Diff\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "STeP-Diff\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u65e2\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u91cf\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u6c61\u67d3\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a new kind of Conductor model trained with reinforcement learning to automatically discover powerful coordination strategies among LLMs. Our Conductor learns not only to design targeted communication topologies for effective agent-to-agent collaboration, but also to prompt engineer focused instructions to the LLMs to maximally leverage their individual capabilities. We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3Conductor\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f7B\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u8c03\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6602\u8d35\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u4e13\u957f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9bLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3Conductor\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u805a\u7126\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6c60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7fConductor\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "7B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Conductor\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u4f5cLLM\u6c60\uff0c\u5728LiveCodeBench\u548cGPQA\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002Conductor\u8fd8\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u5df1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9012\u5f52\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8fed\u4ee3\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u9501\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We first analyze the most common errors found in written Danish. Based on this analysis, we introduce a set of fourteen corruption functions that generate incorrect sentences by systematically introducing errors into existing correct Danish sentences. To ensure the accuracy of these corruptions, we assess their validity using both manual and automatic methods. The results are then used as a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on a linguistic acceptability judgement task. Our findings demonstrate that this extension is both broader and more comprehensive than the current state of the art. By incorporating a greater variety of corruption types, our benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of linguistic acceptability, increasing task difficulty, as evidenced by the lower performance of LLMs on our benchmark compared to existing ones.

In our work, we put a feature-based Artificial Neural Network built around 192 custom features pulled from Sobel edge detection and HSV color analysis up against a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network that blends in EfficientNetV2, plus a straightforward Support Vector Machine as the control. Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction.

We address the challenge of segmenting mixed-authorship text, that is identifying transition points in text where authorship shifts from human to AI or vice-versa, a problem with critical implications for authenticity, trust, and human oversight. We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges.

We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning.

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement.

With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability.

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEAL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u8865\u5168\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684S\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6307\u4ee3\u6d88\u89e3\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6216\u9010\u6b65\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u3002", "method": "SEAL\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5c0fS\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u5757\u4fee\u6b63\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684S\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728SPICE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSEAL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is an expanded version with an appendix", "summary": "Domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, enabling effective retrieval while mitigating domain discrepancies. However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains.

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceECoG\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u91cd\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u786c\u819c\u4e0b\u7535\u6781\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u690d\u5165\u5f0f\u65e0\u7ebf\u786c\u819c\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u97f3\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u76ae\u5c42\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u58f0\u5b66\u8bed\u97f3\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u76ae\u5c42\u5185\u6570\u636e\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8868\u9762ECoG\u8bb0\u5f55\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceECoG\u4fe1\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u91cd\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u766b\u75eb\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u786c\u819c\u4e0b\u7535\u6781\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u8fd0\u52a8BCI\u8bd5\u9a8c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u690d\u5165\u5f0fWIMAGINE\u786c\u819c\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u690d\u5165\u5f0f\u65e0\u7ebf\u786c\u819c\u5916\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eceECoG\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u91cd\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u690d\u5165\u5f0f\u65e0\u7ebf\u786c\u819c\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, this transition is significantly impeded by the lack of scalable infrastructure capable of constructing high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive method designed to systematically scale the diversity and complexity of interactive environments. Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis. We train Nex-N1 upon the diverse and complex interactive environments established by our infrastructure. Empirical results on benchmarks such as SWE-bench and tau2 demonstrate that Nex-N1 consistently outperforms SOTA open-source models and achieves competitive performance against frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks.

Despite the empirical success of methods such as best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling and sequential revision, their fundamental limits remain unclear. We address this gap by analyzing a mixture-of-reference policy model and proving that standard BoN is inherently suboptimal. To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context.

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Arbitrage\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea62\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArbitrage\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4ef2\u88c1\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cArbitrage\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea62\u500d", "conclusion": "Arbitrage\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387"}}

We release both an open-source evaluation suite and a public leaderboard on Hugging Face, and benchmark 12 recent generative models. Results reveal that an increase in stability leads to a decrease in novelty and diversity on average, with no model excelling across all dimensions.

We identify three key research challenges: (i) developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess ethical behavior at individual, interactional, and systemic levels; (ii) elucidating the internal mechanisms that give rise to emergent behaviors through mechanistic interpretability; and (iii) implementing targeted parameter-efficient alignment techniques to steer MALMs towards ethical behaviors without compromising their performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u786e\u4fddLLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff1a\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u4f26\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9610\u660e\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3aMALMs\u4f26\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6563\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CP\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u671f\u671b\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCP\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5e93\u914d\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Through detailed analysis of its design, its novel prediction-anchored learning method, and its profitable performance in a 64,267-hand trial, this paper makes the case that the solved myth is a distraction from the real, far more interesting challenge: creating AI that can master the art of human imperfection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPatrick AI\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u6251\u514bAI\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u7684\"\u5b8c\u7f8e\u89e3\"\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5265\u524a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u4e0d\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u83b7\u80dc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6251\u514bAI\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5fc3\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u4e0d\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6311\u6218\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f31\u70b9\u7684AI\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u89e3\u3002", "method": "Patrick AI\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u4e0d\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u7684\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572864,267\u624b\u724c\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPatrick AI\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76c8\u5229\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5265\u524a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\"\u6c42\u89e3\u795e\u8bdd\"\u5206\u6563\u4e86AI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u638c\u63e1\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u827a\u672f\u7684AI\u3002Patrick\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u624b\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5265\u524a\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u89e3\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm.

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u50cf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u90a3\u6837\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6267\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5173\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ecLLMs\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f305\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e13\u6709\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u547d\u540d\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u53d1\u51fa\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5e8f\u5217\u8ba1\u6570\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u4e9bLLM\u5728\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u8981\u6c42\u679a\u4e3e\u5e8f\u5217\u9879\u6570\u65f6\u81ea\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u6570\u539f\u5219\u7684\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u9075\u5faa\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches.

However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism.

However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASTRIDE\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6269\u5c55STRIDE\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5f15\u5165AI\u7279\u5b9a\u5a01\u80c1\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u67b6\u6784\u56fe\u5230\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u3002", "method": "ASTRIDE\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u5178STRIDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65b0\u589eA\u7c7b\u522b\uff08AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u76df\u548cOpenAI GPT\u63a8\u7406LLM\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\uff0cLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u6574\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660eASTRIDE\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55STRIDE\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03VLM\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406LLM\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "ASTRIDE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u65b0\u5174\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNatural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u8f93\u51fa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u975e\u6807\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNLAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u800c\u975e\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf4\u660e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f55\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7b56\u7565LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u6d4f\u89c8\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b49\u6df7\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNLAC\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "NLAC\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Across a diverse portfolio of games, SIMA 2 substantially closes the gap with human performance and demonstrates robust generalization to previously unseen environments, all while retaining the base model's core reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate a capacity for open-ended self-improvement: by leveraging Gemini to generate tasks and provide rewards, SIMA 2 can autonomously learn new skills from scratch in a new environment. This work validates a path toward creating versatile and continuously learning agents for both virtual and, eventually, physical worlds.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIMA 2\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eGemini\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd3D\u865a\u62df\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982SIMA 1\uff09\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGemini\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u7406\u9ad8\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Gemini\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "result": "SIMA 2\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5168\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002SIMA 2\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eJanossy\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u7c7b\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u968f\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u518d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7Janossy\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b3. \u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u7c7b\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u65e0\u79ef\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u57fa\u7684\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency.

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u7684AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7403\u5806\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u7684SDP\u6784\u9020\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea64-16\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7403\u5806\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7b2c\u5341\u516b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u3001\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9664\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u7279\u6b8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5916\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u5806\u79ef\u548c\u7d27\u4e0a\u754c\u90fd\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\uff08SDP\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5019\u9009SDP\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5929\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SDP\u6784\u9020\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SDP\u6e38\u620f\uff09\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u4e00\u7ec4\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7ec4\u88c5SDP\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea64-16\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u63a8\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u521a\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u75be\u75c5\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f20\u7edfNLP\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u56e0\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u591a\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4eba\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5171\u75c5\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u539f\u751f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u75be\u75c5\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u751f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.", "AI": {"tldr": "STELLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49-\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u6765\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u5efa\u6a21\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u539f\u59cb\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTELLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c(CSP)\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a(FBP)\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u5efa\u6a21\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTELLA\u5728\u957f\u671f\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "STELLA\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6316\u6398\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8865\u5145\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOSAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5404\u533a\u57df/\u7c7b\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u76ee\u6807\u670d\u52a1\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfEO\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u5e73\u6027", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u540c\u6cbb\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u5408\u540c\uff0c\u6784\u5efaOSAG\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\u5408\u540c\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u9a71\u52a8\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u4efd\u989d", "result": "\u5728AVIRIS\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u548cSentinel-2\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOSAG\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "OSAG\u4e3aEO\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u540c\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6cbb\u7406\u6548\u7387"}}

However, current evaluation frameworks may inadequately assess their effectiveness as research collaborators. This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience. These dimensions are essential for evaluating AI systems as research co-pilots rather than as isolated task executors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b64\u7acb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8861\u91cfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e862018\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u81f32025\u5e7410\u670831\u65e5\u671f\u95f4\u4e09\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u5370\u672c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa14\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5728\u6587\u732e\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u4f5c\u8005\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u8005\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

This requires models that can represent the influence of local site conditions on ground motion characteristics. In this context, data driven approaches that learn site controlled signatures from recorded ground motions offer a promising direction. We address strong ground motion generation from time-domain accelerometer records and introduce the TimesNet-Gen, a time-domain conditional generator. The approach uses a station specific latent bottleneck. We evaluate generation by comparing HVSR curves and fundamental site-frequency $f_0$ distributions between real and generated records per station, and summarize station specificity with a score based on the $f_0$ distribution confusion matrices. TimesNet-Gen achieves strong station-wise alignment and compares favorably with a spectrogram-based conditional VAE baseline for site-specific strong motion synthesis.

This raises the question of whether they may also engage in deception, similar to how individuals in human organizations lie to superiors to create a good image or avoid punishment. We observe and define agentic upward deception, a phenomenon in which an agent facing environmental constraints conceals its failure and performs actions that were not requested without reporting. To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files.

Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Trinity\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5206\u914d\u4e09\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u601d\u8003\u8005\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u95ed\u6e90API\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6709\u6548\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u7ea60.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ea610K\u53c2\u6570\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e3a\u9009\u5b9a\u7684LLM\u5206\u914d\u4e09\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u601d\u8003\u8005\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0cLiveCodeBench\u5f97\u520686.2%\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Trinity\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u6709\u6548\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%.

Individual large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistency, whereas naive ensembles of models often fail to deliver stable and credible recommendations. Building on our previous work on LLM Chemistry, which quantifies the collaborative compatibility among LLMs, we apply this framework to improve the reliability in medication recommendation from brief clinical vignettes. Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations.

The lecture notes systematically introduce the fundamental concepts, modeling components, and theoretical foundations of regression analysis, covering linear regression, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, polynomial regression, basis-function models, kernel-based methods, and neural-network-based nonlinear regression. Core methodological topics include loss-function design, parameter-estimation principles, ordinary least squares, gradient-based optimization algorithms and their variants, as well as regularization techniques such as Ridge and LASSO regression. Through detailed mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and intuitive visual explanations, the materials help students understand not only how regression models are constructed and optimized, but also how they reveal the underlying relationships between features and response variables.

The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens.

Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $\u0398\\(n^{-1/d}\\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core. Hence, using standard results we obtain upper bounds on the approximation rate of neural network classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\"\u51f8\u6838\"\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u9690\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u4e0d\u53d7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u901a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u0398(n^{-1/d})\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u80fd\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5f88\u597d\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u90a3\u4e9b\u80fd\u7528\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u826f\u597d\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u5176\"\u51f8\u6838\"\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5355\u9690\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u9690\u85cf\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\u4e86\u51f8\u6838\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u51f8\u6838\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u7406\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u53d7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u6838\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u67d0\u4e9b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As agent use proliferates, dynamic multi-agent systems have naturally emerged. Recent work has investigated the theoretical and empirical properties of low-dimensional representations of agents based on query responses at a single time point. This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly embeds agents across time, and proposes several novel hypothesis tests for detecting behavioral change at the agent- and group-level in black-box multi-agent systems.

We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions. We discuss limitations-including OR homogeneity and the omission of explicit staffing constraints-and outline extensions.

Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input.

While existing neural operators (NOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations, they remain limited in practice due to poor scalability on dense grids, error accumulation during dynamic unrolling, and task-specific design. ECHO addresses these challenges through three key innovations. (i) It employs a hierarchical convolutional encode-decode architecture that achieves a 100 $\\times$ spatio-temporal compression while preserving fidelity on mesh points. (ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation.

The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset.

This work presents the first large-scale evaluation of hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) autoencoders for this task. We construct a unified experimental framework that iterates over key quantum design choices, including quantum-layer placement, measurement approach, variational and non-variational formulations, and latent-space regularization. Experiments across three benchmark NIDS datasets show that HQC autoencoders can match or exceed classical performance in their best configurations, although they exhibit higher sensitivity to architectural decisions. Under zero-day evaluation, well-configured HQC models provide stronger and more stable generalization than classical and supervised baselines. Simulated gate-noise experiments reveal early performance degradation, indicating the need for noise-aware HQC designs. These results provide the first data-driven characterization of HQC autoencoder behavior for network intrusion detection and outline key factors that govern their practical viability.

Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows. Additionally, we curate a dataset of 500M 3D molecular conformers, complementing protein-ligand data and expanding the chemical diversity available for training. OMTRA obtains state of the art performance on pocket-conditioned de novo design and docking; however, the effects of large-scale pretraining and multi-task training are modest.

They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences.

Dalca"], "title": "Deep infant brain segmentation from multi-contrast MRI", "comment": "8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, website at https://w3id.org/babyseg, presented at the 2025 IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers", "summary": "Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "BabySeg\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u8111\u90e8MRI\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cdMRI\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\u6c60\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u8111\u90e8MRI\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u975e\u5934\u90e8\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u9891\u7e41\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u5f02\u56fe\u50cf\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5408\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u6c60\u5316\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdc\u5c11\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "BabySeg\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u8111\u90e8MRI\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684MRI\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGG-Flow\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u6301", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVGG-Flow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5dee\u5f02\u5e94\u4e0e\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94", "result": "\u5728Stable Diffusion 3\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cVGG-Flow\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5fae\u5206\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03", "conclusion": "VGG-Flow\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources.
