### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了识别城市环境中感知与意见之间情感不一致的新方法，通过街景图像和社交媒体文本分析北京二环地区的情感反应变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入在人类感知和意见中的情感反应细微变化，这对城市研究中的多维情感分析方法提出了挑战。

Method: 构建包含140,750张街景图像和984,024条微博文本的数据集，开发反应指数整合物体检测和自然语言处理技术，使用回归分析、图像分割和词频分析来分类和分析情感。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更均匀，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。不匹配图揭示了人类感知与意见情感之间的显著差异，情感变化与密集建筑和行人存在等元素密切相关。

Conclusion: 研究提供了疫情前后感知和意见情感的不一致图，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准，通过构建包含异构检索策略和智能体工作流程噪声的长上下文环境，评估大语言模型在真实场景中的长上下文鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试过于理想化，忽略了真实世界中由于有偏检索和智能体工作流程产生的噪声上下文。需要构建更贴近实际的噪声长上下文来测试模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估异构检索策略（稀疏、稠密、混合、基于图）对干扰项组成和LLM性能的影响，并扩展到动态的智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验涉及15个长上下文模型，发现：更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，而基于图的重新排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；在智能体测试中，即使是先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败或难以提前停止。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现LLMs在多数语言中无需微调即可达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但尚无证据表明其在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性。本文旨在探索LLMs在该任务中的能力

Method: 比较两种方法：(i) 在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii) 使用LLMs直接进行上下文词形生成。在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上进行实验

Result: 实验发现：编码器在域外设置下使用黄金数据微调时仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中无需微调即可达到最先进结果，仅需少量示例

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，无需先验微调即可在多数语言中达到SOTA效果，为低资源语言和领域提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR系统，相比传统WER指标能更公平地处理形态和句法差异，在印地语上达到94%与人工标注的相关性，并展示小模型微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响语义的形态和句法差异惩罚过重，需要更公平的评估方法。

Method: 使用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示词学习评分标准；同时展示小模型在参考和ASR预测的词对上微调以预测惩罚类型的方法。

Result: 印地语LASER评分与人工标注达到94%高相关性；印地语示例对其他印度语言（马拉地语、卡纳达语、马拉雅拉姆语）错误分析也有效；小模型微调预测惩罚类型准确率接近89%。

Conclusion: LLM-based LASER评分标准能更公平地评估ASR系统，在多种印度语言上表现良好，小模型微调方法也展示了可行性。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了基于人体骨骼姿态的手语表达评估方法，比较了关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种指标，并通过检索实验和人工相关性研究展示了不同场景下的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为手语翻译或生成系统提供有意义且可复现的评估方法，解决手语表达评估的标准化问题。

Method: 使用关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种评估指标，通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人工相关性研究（跨语言文本到姿态翻译）进行验证。

Result: 揭示了不同评估指标在不同场景下的权衡关系，开发了开源姿态评估工具包。

Conclusion: 该研究为手语翻译系统的开发和评估提供了实用且可复现的方法论和工具支持。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用基于评分标准和锚点的思维链提示方法，让LLM能够像人类编码员一样准确识别民粹主义内容，分类准确率与专家相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析方法测量民粹主义思想内容成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展。

Method: 利用全球民粹主义数据库，通过评分标准和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，模拟人类编码员训练过程，指导LLM进行推理。

Result: 这种特定领域提示策略使LLM在分类准确率上与专家人类编码员相当，能够处理民粹主义的细微和语境敏感方面。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准和锚点的思维链提示方法为大规模、跨语言的民粹主义内容分析提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过最大后验推理和信念传播算法，解决多智能体系统中提示优化的指数级搜索空间和信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化尚未充分探索。

Method: MAPRO采用四阶段框架：将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法求解，通过拓扑感知的细化机制整合执行反馈和下游责任来迭代更新智能体提示。

Result: 在各种任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，持续超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动替代方案。

Conclusion: 基于MAP的公式化为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和解耦KV缓存过滤，在测试时缩放任务中显著减少内存瓶颈，实现理论最优的每输出令牌时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长思维链提升LLM推理能力，但线性KV缓存增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有查询感知的稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖和粗粒度令牌选择，在高并发和长思维链场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含：(1)轻量级时间回归模块预测下一令牌查询状态；(2)异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠令牌级KV选择与前向推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，实现理论最优TPOT。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，同时在多个TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确率。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade是首个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖的方法，为高效TTS提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个多智能体框架来检验团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态，发现在常识和社交推理任务中，扁平团队表现优于层级团队，多样性影响复杂，智能体对团队表现过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类团队科学启发，探索LLM驱动的多智能体系统中的团队动态，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，评估团队在四个任务（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa、Latent Implicit Hate）中的表现，涵盖常识和社交推理。

Result: 扁平团队表现优于层级团队；多样性影响复杂；智能体对团队表现过度自信；任务后反思显示对合作的赞赏但存在整合挑战。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队动态研究具有重要意义，扁平结构更有效，但需要解决智能体间的协调和整合问题。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，提出通过提前推理和DPO优化来平衡语音代理的准确性和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在处理复杂推理任务时表现不佳，同时语音交互的延迟问题也影响用户体验。

Method: 采用思维链微调方法，引入基于熵的"问题完整性"指标来指导模型在用户查询结束前开始推理，并使用DPO优化准确性和延迟的权衡。

Result: 思维链微调使语音LLM在口语推理任务上的准确率平均提高2.4倍；提前推理方法在同等延迟条件下在ARC-Easy上获得4%的准确率提升；DPO优化实现了70%的延迟降低且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能显著提升语音LLM的推理能力，结合提前推理和DPO优化可以有效平衡准确性和延迟，为语音代理系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架，通过可重用的思维模板来指导长上下文语言模型的多跳推理，解决简单堆叠文档无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据之间的连接关系，限制了多跳推理能力。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理过程重构为可重用的思维缓存，通过从先前问题解决轨迹中提取模板来结构化证据组合方式；并提出基于自然语言反馈的迭代更新策略来优化模板。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法在基于检索和无检索设置下均优于强基线；优化后的模板可蒸馏到更小的开源模型中，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架通过思维模板有效增强了长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，实现了透明推理重用，在多种场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，该模型在现有所有数据集上训练，并在多个领域实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯文和塔吉克-西里尔文），虽然方言相似但书写差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有模型局限于特定领域文本，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 开发了一个序列到序列的音译模型，在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并创建了两个新数据集来增强模型的领域适应性。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向获得chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，在Tajik到Farsi方向获得chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对波斯语-塔吉克语音译任务更清晰的理解，建立了全面的基准，模型、数据和代码均已公开。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新模型，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文场景下实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文中的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重退化，甚至导致生成速度下降。

Method: OWL模型采用三种创新：(1) 基于LSTM的drafter，仅基于最后一个token状态进行条件化，使其能够泛化到各种长度；(2) 在验证器中使用特殊token [SPEC]为drafter生成更丰富的表示；(3) 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，解决了现有方法在长上下文中的性能退化问题。

Conclusion: 通过发布新的长上下文基准测试(LongSpecBench)和OWL模型，为推测解码在真实世界长上下文场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案，并开源了所有代码和数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

Motivation: 解决小型视觉语言模型（≤2B参数）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估器表现不佳的问题，使其能在资源受限的实际环境中使用。

Method: 采用多标准提示方法将多个评估标准整合到单个查询中，以及通过领域自适应迁移学习在图表数据集上微调2B参数模型，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性缺陷，导致性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了基于任务特定LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，解决轻量级BERT编码器在移动设备上部署时的任务冲突问题，在21个下游任务上实现NER平均提升0.8%、文本分类平均提升8.8%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要模型既能适应多样化应用，又能在内存和计算上保持高效。研究如何增强轻量级BERT编码器在命名实体识别和文本分类两个基础NLP任务族上的适应性。

Method: 提出基于任务特定LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单一共享编码器骨干网络配合模块化适配器，避免朴素多任务预微调带来的优化信号冲突问题。

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验显示，NER任务平均提升0.8%，文本分类任务平均提升8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当，同时满足实际部署约束。

Conclusion: 该方法为移动NLP应用提供了有效的多任务预微调解决方案，能够在保持部署效率的同时提升模型在多个任务上的适应性。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析发现，新冠疫情健康谣言与事实性内容在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用上存在显著差异。谣言具有更低的可读性、更多恐惧相关词汇，但较少使用感叹号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康谣言与事实性内容在语言特征上的差异，以帮助检测网络健康谣言并改进公共卫生传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库（COVID-19谣言、一般COVID-19内容、猴痘相关内容）进行对比分析，考察可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言的使用差异。

Result: COVID-19谣言的可读性得分显著更低，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，但感叹号使用最少。这些模式表明谣言采用复杂的修辞风格并嵌入情感线索。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了健康谣言的独特语言特征，有助于谣言检测和公共卫生传播策略改进。未来研究应纳入纵向设计、更广泛的情感词典和平台敏感方法。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个使用LLMs辅助构建人造语言的模块化系统，包含音系学设计、句子翻译、词典构建、正字法设计和语法手册编写等功能，并探索LLMs对语言概念的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双重目标：1) 为创建人造语言提供有趣工具；2) 探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度，以及将方法应用于从高资源语言到低资源语言的翻译任务。

Method: 模块化系统：首先通过代理方法创建目标音系学，然后从英语句子翻译成形态句法标记，构建词典，设计正字法，最后编写语法手册。系统还能进一步翻译句子到目标语言。

Result: 不同LLMs在处理不同语言规范时能力差异较大，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易。在低资源语言翻译任务中目前结果多为负面，但改进版本可能带来实际收益。

Conclusion: 该系统成功展示了LLMs在构建人造语言方面的应用潜力，同时揭示了LLMs在语言理解能力上的局限性，特别是在处理罕见语言模式方面的挑战。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了语言模型输入词汇表示的结构及其在训练过程中的演变，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和语法特征高度相关，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型输入词汇表示的结构如何形成，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何演变，特别是与语义、语法和词频特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型的输入和输出嵌入进行几何结构分析，与语义、语法和基于频率的指标进行相关性实验。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练过程中快速收敛到与语义和语法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量。

Conclusion: 词汇几何围绕语言结构的动态轨迹揭示了词频和功能词的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演变如何促进模型能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过临床编码验证来改进LLM在医疗编码任务中的表现，特别是针对层次结构相近但错误的预测代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，且基于精确匹配的评估方法无法识别层次结构相近的错误预测，这类错误占据了LLM失败的很大部分。

Method: 采用轻量级干预措施（提示工程和小规模微调）改进准确性，引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并发布专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是改进基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠步骤，能够显著减少层次结构相近的错误预测。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是提升LLM医疗编码性能的关键方法，轻量级干预措施能够在不增加计算开销的情况下改善准确性。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在基于角色的访问控制(RBAC)下的拒绝行为，通过扩展Spider和BIRD数据集评估了三种方法：提示工程、两步验证框架和LoRA微调，发现显式验证能提高拒绝精度，而微调在安全性和实用性之间达到更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不受限制的响应，模糊了角色边界，需要研究LLM如何遵守访问控制策略，在授权时回答，未授权时拒绝。

Method: 创建了扩展Spider和BIRD文本到SQL的数据集，添加了PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种设计：零/少样本提示、两步生成-验证管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，微调在安全性和实用性之间达到了更好的平衡，更长更复杂的策略降低了所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 两步验证框架在提高拒绝精度方面表现最佳，而微调方法在保持实用性的同时实现了更好的安全性平衡，复杂策略对所有方法都构成挑战。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统银行界面采用僵化的多屏工作流程，而现有的AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色，无法执行核心金融交易。Ryt AI旨在用自然语言对话完全替代传统银行界面，实现监管批准的核心金融操作。

Method: 完全内部构建的Ryt AI框架，使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付、FAQ）协调对话。每个代理为ILMU附加任务特定的LoRA适配器，在银行基础设施内托管以确保行为一致性。采用确定性护栏、人工确认和无状态审计架构提供深度防御。

Result: 成功实现了监管批准的自然语言界面，能够可靠支持严格治理下的核心金融操作，证明了对话AI可以作为主要银行界面。

Conclusion: Ryt AI展示了在严格监管环境下，自然语言界面能够可靠地执行核心金融交易，代表了银行界面设计的重大进步。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于最优脑损伤理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过将缓存淘汰建模为结构化剪枝问题，使用输出感知的token重要性评分来改进现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的长上下文窗口带来显著内存开销，现有缓存淘汰方法使用启发式注意力权重排名，未考虑对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 基于OBD理论，将缓存淘汰建模为层间结构化剪枝问题，通过测量剪枝token引起的注意力输出扰动来量化token重要性，推导出孤立key、孤立value和联合key-value的闭式评分。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知评分替换现有工作的启发式评分，能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache通过输出感知的token重要性评分，为缓存淘汰提供了更理论化的方法，显著改进了长上下文任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型偏见测量主要使用令牌概率(TP)指标，但这些指标被批评与现实使用场景和实际危害脱节，需要更现实的替代评估方法。

Method: 测试自然语言推理(NLI)作为偏见评估指标，比较NLI与TP指标的行为差异，分析不同NLI指标之间的相关性以及NLI与TP指标的相关性。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为显著不同，相关性很低；NLI指标更可能检测到"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感和脆弱。

Conclusion: 令牌概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前AI模型规范面临内部原则冲突和复杂场景覆盖不足的挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范问题。

Method: 通过生成迫使模型在不同价值原则间做出明确权衡的场景，使用分类法创建多样化的价值权衡情境，评估12个前沿LLM的行为分歧。

Result: 识别出超过70,000个显著行为分歧案例，模型行为的高度分歧强烈预示着模型规范中的潜在问题，发现了直接矛盾、解释模糊性、明显错位和误报拒绝等问题。

Conclusion: 模型行为分歧是识别规范问题的有效指标，当前模型规范存在显著的原则冲突和模糊性问题，需要改进规范设计以减少行为不一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言线索，难以有效泛化到不同风格变化，且不同平台的仇恨言论具有特定目标和风格，容易产生虚假相关性。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为因果图，包含上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素，通过因果表示学习框架解构仇恨言论并控制混杂变量，支持反事实推理。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习框架能够有效分离仇恨意图与表面语言特征，提高仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互方式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本反馈，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，未能建模反映用户兴趣动态变化的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，将用户全部文本历史编织成分层记忆，包含两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆（捕获具体用户行为）和认知记忆（表示长期偏好），两者都整合了时间和语义信息但在不同抽象层次。

Result: 在语言模型个性化（LaMP）基准测试中验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver的双组件记忆作为用户的统一表示，使大语言模型能够同时推理具体行为和抽象特征，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,

TL;DR: SubQRAG是一个基于子问题的图检索增强生成框架，通过将复杂问题分解为可验证的子问题链，动态扩展知识图谱，构建可追溯的图记忆，显著提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法虽然能构建知识图谱连接分散事实，但缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序子问题链，为每个子问题检索相关三元组，在现有图谱不足时实时从源文档动态扩展图谱，聚合所有推理过程的三元组形成图记忆。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG取得了一致且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面表现突出。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的推理框架有效解决了图RAG在深度推理方面的局限性，为复杂多跳问答提供了结构化且可追溯的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Motivation: 现有MKGC研究未能充分利用LLMs的多语言能力，忽视了跨语言知识的可共享性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出KL-GMoE（知识级分组混合专家）来高效建模共享知识，以及IER（迭代实体重排序）来显著提升知识利用率。

Result: 在5语言数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别提升了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用了跨语言共享知识，在未见语言和不平衡语言设置下也展现了良好的知识共享特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO训练LLM时面临模型响应不准确（特别是小规模架构）、性能提升有限、训练中期崩溃等问题，影响了稳定性和最终效果。

Method: ToolExpander框架包含：(1)动态多轮硬采样：用高质量少样本演示替换困难样本，配合指数学习率衰减；(2)自示例思维：去除KL散度，调整裁剪系数，通过微小奖励(0.01)让模型自主生成分析少样本示例。

Result: ToolExpander显著提升了LLM（特别是较弱的小规模模型）的工具使用能力，改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander通过创新的训练策略有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限LLM的工具导向强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性，需要更可靠且可扩展的评分标准生成方法。

Method: 引入对比性评分标准生成(CRG)，通过对比优选和拒绝响应来推导硬规则和原则，并使用拒绝采样提高可靠性。

Conclusion: 评分标准提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了人工评估与自动奖励建模之间的差距，为大语言模型对齐开启了新的原则驱动范式。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向，实现了潜在推理模型的并行测试时扩展。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在多项选择题中的推理策略，特别是当只有选项输入时的表现，挑战部分输入成功总是问题的观点。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决多项选择题，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和半数仅选项情况下提升准确率；仅选项成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响，推理轨迹通过忠实性测试，显示使用较少问题策略如推断缺失问题。

Conclusion: 部分输入成功不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可用于区分问题数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 该论文发现数学推理大语言模型仅基于最终答案的奖励机制容易导致奖励欺骗，造成模型推理能力被高估。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型，通过评估整个推理轨迹来提升模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于最终答案的奖励机制存在严重缺陷，导致大量虚假阳性案例——模型通过不合理的推理过程得到正确答案。这种奖励欺骗现象严重高估了模型的实际推理能力。

Method: 提出了Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，根据问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹。RRM提供细粒度的校准奖励(0-1)，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，基于RRM的训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督方法。在AIME2024上，Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，奇迹步骤的发生率减少了71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。过程导向的奖励机制能有效缓解奖励欺骗问题，提升模型推理的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可被理解为可控的均衡现象而非必然衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Conclusion: 旋转约束补偿方法能有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留可能更重要的组件，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,

remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven

TL;DR: HiPRAG是一种用于优化agentic RAG系统搜索效率的强化学习方法，通过分层过程奖励来减少过度搜索和搜索不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结果奖励的RL训练方法缺乏细粒度控制，导致agentic RAG系统存在过度搜索和搜索不足的问题，造成不必要的开销和不可靠输出。

Method: 提出分层过程奖励方法，将代理的推理轨迹分解为离散步骤，实时评估每个搜索决策的必要性，在常用的结果和格式奖励基础上增加基于最优搜索和非搜索步骤比例的额外奖励。

Result: 在7个多样化QA基准测试中，Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型平均准确率达到65.4%(3B)和67.2%(7B)，同时将过度搜索率降至2.3%并降低搜索不足率。

Conclusion: HiPRAG证明了通过RL进行细粒度控制对于提高搜索代理推理效率和最优性的重要性和潜力，具有良好的跨RL算法、模型系列、大小和类型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统的通信拓扑多为静态或手工设计，无法适应不同任务需求，导致简单任务通信开销过大或复杂任务性能瓶颈。

Method: GTD框架将拓扑合成建模为迭代构建过程，使用轻量级代理模型预测多目标奖励来引导生成，实现实时、无梯度的任务自适应拓扑优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GTD能生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM智能体协作中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑合成过程，有效解决了多智能体系统通信拓扑设计的复杂权衡问题，实现了更好的任务适应性。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成式信息检索在单语言场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符不对齐和标识符膨胀两大挑战。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子来对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，采用动态多步约束解码策略进行检索。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时减少文档标识符长度74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成检索的关键问题，在提升准确率的同时显著提高了解码效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，解决小语言模型性能提升的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在延迟和计算约束下性能提升困难，现有知识蒸馏方法存在训练-推理不匹配或依赖低质量学生输出的问题。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，让学生模型先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导，动态结合两种生成策略。

Result: 在三个数据集和两种教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，且额外开销可接受。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch为小语言模型蒸馏提供了一种实用有效的方法，同时保持了一致性和监督质量。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

Motivation: 长思维链推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在过度思考问题——即使是简单查询也会进行不必要的冗长推理，导致计算效率低下。现有研究缺乏对过度思考根本原因的理解。

Method: 提出TRACE分析方法：1) 将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2) 推断子思维间的语篇关系，构建细粒度思维进展图；3) 识别相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 发现开源权重思维模型存在两种主要模式——探索者和晚期着陆，证实过度验证和过度探索是LLM过度思考的主要驱动因素。长思维模型在简单任务上比短思维模型慢5-20倍，且无实质性准确率提升。

Conclusion: 提出基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了基于长度的度量标准，为理解LLM思维进展和原则性过度思考管理提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法虽然有望扩展大语言模型，但受到弱模型输出中噪声和偏差的限制，影响其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用隐式奖励（通过对数似然比近似显式奖励）与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在预对齐和对齐后弱模型之间进行对比解码。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果证实了持续改进，展示了ConG的通用性和有效性，实现了更可靠的能力转移、去噪和改进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化，为通向AGI提供有前景的途径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Method: 在德语和多种德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较文本模型、语音模型和级联系统的性能。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最好。如果转录系统生成标准化的输出，级联系统在方言数据上表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 语音模型是处理方言数据的最佳选择，而级联系统在特定条件下也能在方言数据上取得不错效果。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench能够系统性地测试LLM在严格遵循逐步指令方面的能力，为LLM评估提供了新的客观标准。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Result: 在GPT-J上比最先进方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%；揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式

Conclusion: 基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究三种自动化评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于Q&A的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在评估LLM生成文本完整性方面表现优异，但需要在效率和可解释性之间权衡，同时评估了多个开源LLM基于多源回答用户查询时的完整性表现。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when

TL;DR: 该研究展示了大型语言模型在17-18世纪爱沙尼亚语词典研究中的应用潜力，包括词典信息半自动丰富、哥特体文字识别和跨源数据集准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在爱沙尼亚语等小语种历史词典研究中的应用，以节省时间和经济资源。

Method: 使用Claude 3.7 Sonnet等LLMs进行词典信息丰富化，采用零样本方法进行哥特体文字识别，使用重叠分块扫描图像文件进行数字化处理。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet能为81%的词条准确提供含义和现代对应词；零样本方法成功识别并结构化41%的词条；重叠分块方法有效用于词典数字化。

Conclusion: 即使对于小语种，大型语言模型在历史词典研究中具有显著的时间和经济资源节省潜力。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测歧义问题并收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，在八个开放域问答基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理允许多个有效答案的问题时表现不佳，标准QA基准通常假设单一黄金答案，无法提供适当的训练信号，而现有的歧义处理方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 使用自动化流水线检测歧义问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案，然后使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，自然适应多个答案。

Result: A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中平均AnsF1@1得分达48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%），在八个开放域QA基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决歧义并在不同基准测试中泛化，表明接受歧义对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个创新框架，利用小型语言模型(SLMs)来指导大型语言模型(LLMs)推理，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，显著提升推理性能同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据且对所有token进行统一优化，而实际上只有少数token具有重要学习价值。本文探索小型模型能否通过揭示高价值推理时刻来指导大型模型。

Method: LightReasoner框架包含两个阶段：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建监督示例；(2)微调阶段：基于这些蒸馏的示例对齐专家模型，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%时间消耗、80%采样问题和99%调优token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为提升LLM推理能力提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，帮助大语言模型在社交推理任务中区分客观现实与主观信念，显著提升了推理准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中存在认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及混淆客观世界状态与主观信念状态的问题，导致推理错误或无限循环。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的困惑指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行及时干预。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中，该机制显著提升了推理准确性（如在Hi-ToM中提升10%），同时减少了计算成本（最高减少33.8%的token使用量）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署大语言模型提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，通过模仿人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式，解决了模型在社交推理中的核心问题。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法在结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应方面存在不足。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段使用DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行上下文过滤和类别特定提示优化；第二阶段使用少量样本提示和配置文件进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本和通用优化方法，ROUGE-1召回率提升+8.3%，精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%；风格精炼使BLEU得分提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Method: 引入分层内存模块组织不同层级的经验，在执行子任务后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合回内存模块

Result: 在TAC长时程生产力基准测试中取得新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型，随着经验积累任务完成能力持续提升

Conclusion: MUSE建立了一个能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理新范式，具有强大的泛化能力和零样本改进能力

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT在机器翻译领域的潜力，特别是针对日英翻译任务，评估其在文档级翻译、提示策略优化以及与现有商业系统的竞争力。

Method: 采用自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估方法，比较ChatGPT在简单提示和增强提示下的表现，分析文档级与句子级翻译差异，并与两个知名翻译系统进行对比。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在准确性上更优，ChatGPT-4在流畅性上更好；ChatGPT与商业翻译系统表现相当。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中展现出竞争力，文档级翻译策略更有效，但在提示优化方面仍需进一步研究，不同版本在准确性和流畅性上存在权衡。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能编码非平凡的气候结构，但在高海拔和高纬度地区存在空间一致错误，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，理解其内部气候知识对于可靠性和错误信息风险评估至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态参数知识的能力尚未得到充分表征。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的陆地网格查询，要求模型回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，提供坐标和位置描述符，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证。

Result: LLMs能捕获纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差±1°C，但在1500米以上海拔性能急剧下降（RMSE达5-13°C），包含地理背景可平均减少27%误差。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能捕获当前气候分布，但无法准确表示长期温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动态至关重要，评估框架为量化LLMs参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Result: 提供了PRMs设计空间的清晰视图，揭示了开放挑战，并为未来研究提供了指导。

Conclusion: PRMs为实现细粒度、鲁棒的推理对齐提供了重要方向，需要进一步研究来完善这一方法。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间难以平衡，现有联邦学习方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，并在多轮训练后遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE方法，不直接替换本地模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度得分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明FedDTRE能够提高对话模型性能，增强对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合策略，有效解决了联邦学习对话生成中的过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Method: 收集了3000个人类合理性判断和13600个LLM判断，通过展示LLM生成的支持/反对理由来观察判断变化。

Result: 当存在LLM生成的支持理由时，人类合理性评分上升；存在反对理由时评分下降，表明人类认为这些理由具有说服力。LLM实验也显示出类似的影响模式。

Conclusion: LLM可用于研究人类认知，但也带来实际担忧——即使在常识这种人类擅长的领域，LLM仍可能对人们的信念产生显著影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Conclusion: 推理能有效提升LLM谈判能力但成本高昂，多语言推理存在显著差异，这对通过推理痕迹实现可解释性有重要影响。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，能够高效地将给定的自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇量的模型。

Result: 通过最大公共词汇，不同分词方式的语言模型能够有效地相互协作。

Conclusion: 无损词汇缩减框架为语言模型间的协作提供了理论基础，解决了不同分词方式带来的兼容性问题。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Result: 两种模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高0.93），但在模糊案例中性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、不明确引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理错误的分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，并展示了如何支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

TL;DR: 提出CLoVE和GloVE两种算法，从LLM作为评判者的决策中提取基于概念的可验证全局策略，用于内容危害检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模用于替代人类标注，需要理解其潜在偏见和风险。

Method: CLoVE生成基于概念的对比性局部解释，GloVE通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个标准内容危害检测数据集上，提取的全局策略对LLM评判决策具有高保真度，且对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提取可理解的全局策略，有助于理解LLM评判者的决策逻辑和潜在偏见。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏见，倾向于偏爱自己生成的回答，这降低了评估的可靠性。

Method: 将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟客户端-服务器轮询机制进行无监督优化。

Result: Genii在无需人工标注的情况下超越了基于标注数据训练的监督模型，有效减轻了判断偏好偏见。

Conclusion: Genii框架能够有效缓解LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏见，提高评估的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Method: 从历史客户-客服对话中提取QA对自动构建知识库，并在内部数据上微调轻量级LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B）。

Result: 在20家公司上的实证评估显示，系统在回答信息查询问题时准确率超过90%，优于更大的闭源LLM。

Conclusion: 该系统能够立即部署基于RAG的聊天机器人，有效解决了联络中心知识库构建的冷启动问题。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型经常对包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求产生错误的拒绝，这种过度安全拒绝问题影响了模型的实用性。

Method: 引入两个基准测试：单轮提示的XSB和多轮对话的MS-XSB；使用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发词；部署三种轻量级方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 实验显示这些方法在四个指令调优的Llama模型上显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可复现的诊断和缓解过度安全拒绝的框架，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有解决方案如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式和任务特定的，缺乏通用的自适应推理框架。

Method: ARM2采用强化学习框架，结合长度感知优化，统一处理多种推理格式。除了自然语言推理，还集成视觉理解和可执行代码，通过代码执行显著减少token成本。

Result: 实验表明ARM2在保持与传统GRPO训练推理模型相当性能的同时，平均减少超过70%的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2提供了一个有效的自适应推理框架，通过集成多模态能力和代码执行，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Conclusion: MetricalARGS为通过韵律诗歌视角理解当代LLM的能力和局限性提供了新的框架和可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是一种成本效益高的解决方案，能够有效提升LLM智能体性能，同时解决数据稀缺和过拟合问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，通过二分图分析和案例研究验证，展示函数令牌如何激活特征并指导下一个令牌预测。

Result: 实验证明少数函数令牌激活了大部分特征，预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导。

Conclusion: 函数令牌在LLMs的记忆检索和巩固中起关键作用，激活最具预测性的特征并促进模型学习。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在恶意或不正确数据上微调后，是否会在高风险场景下表现出广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为，即研究不诚实领域的涌现性失调现象。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域的不良补全上进行微调，实验包括直接微调、下游混合任务微调（仅引入1%不良数据）以及模拟人类-AI交互环境（10%偏见用户）。

Result: LLMs在微调后表现出广泛的不诚实行为；仅引入1%不良数据就能使诚实行为下降超过20%；在10%偏见用户环境中，助手模型会无意间加剧不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 涌现性失调风险不仅存在于直接微调中，也存在于下游混合任务和实际人类-AI交互中，需要在高风险场景下特别关注LLMs的不诚实和欺骗行为。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反因果声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果提取研究中忽视反因果声明的问题，并证明整合反因果声明能显著提升模型区分正反因果关系的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果提取数据集仅关注支持因果关系的"正因果"声明，完全忽视或错误标注反驳因果关系的"反因果"声明。这种忽视限制了模型对不完全知识下因果推理的理解能力。

Method: 通过广泛的文献综述建立理论基础，制定严格的标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上扩充反因果声明，获得Cohen's κ=0.74的高标注者间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，未训练反因果关系的模型倾向于将反因果声明误分类为正因果。基于新数据集训练后，transformer模型能有效区分正反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于因果提取至关重要，新数据集能够显著改善模型对因果关系的理解能力，避免将反因果关系误判为正因果关系。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全防护模型完全拒绝包含不安全内容的方法会加剧过度拒绝问题，且无法为被拒绝的查询提供细致指导，需要在帮助性和无害性之间找到更好的平衡。

Method: 提出WaltzRL框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。使用动态改进奖励机制，根据对话智能体整合反馈的程度来调整奖励。推理时改进而非丢弃不安全或过度拒绝的回复。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全回复（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%）。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，推动了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 研究探索使用对比解码生成合成语料库来增强语言模型训练，发现混合真实数据和合成数据能提升语言建模和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练面临文本数据限制，需要探索使用LLM生成的合成数据作为补充训练资源。

Method: 在受控环境中，使用对比解码方法（基于好模型和差模型之间的相对差异）生成合成语料库，并将其与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 混合合成数据和真实数据进行训练，在语言建模目标和多种下游任务上均表现出性能提升。对比解码生成的合成数据对需要推理技能的任务帮助更大，而传统采样方法生成的合成数据对依赖表层语言能力的任务更有效。

Conclusion: 使用对比解码生成合成语料库并与真实数据混合训练是提升语言模型性能的有效方法，特别能增强模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索代理基准测试中取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在多轮长时交互中激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和可靠性问题，以及长上下文管理效率问题

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制消除对外部摘要模型的依赖

Result: DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源代理提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中均表现优异，动态上下文管理支持近100轮交互

Conclusion: DeepMiner有效解决了多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，显著提升了智能体的深度推理能力

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别了驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，这些神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层中，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但LLMs表现出文化偏见和对弱势文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确识别文化相关神经元。识别出文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 抑制这些文化相关神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能（最多下降30%），但对一般自然语言理解基准测试影响很小。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 训练自然语言理解基准可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力，特别是当更新包含大量文化通用神经元的模块时。这些发现为LLMs内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供了实践指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的对抗指令生成和反思循环来提升攻击成功率，比现有方法具有更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了合成对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的LLM安全评估方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：角色引导的对抗指令生成和反思循环迭代优化低质量提示，引入验证器评估提示危害性而无需查询目标模型。

Result: 构建了两个红队数据集AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard，在8个最先进LLM上评估，相比基线方法获得更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队方法在LLM安全评估方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段用多视角LLM投票或基于心理特征的方法处理模糊案例，在效率和准确性上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球自杀率上升，社交媒体提供重要信号，但现有模型难以检测隐晦的自杀意念，轻量模型无法处理隐晦信号，大语言模型计算成本过高。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段BERT快速处理高置信度明确案例；第二阶段对模糊输入采用多视角LLM投票框架或基于LLM提取的心理特征构建的机器学习集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异：明确案例F1达98.0%，隐晦案例F1达99.7%，跨域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率和鲁棒性，是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测的工作之一。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示和学习两个方面的独立性，发现演示的表示决定ICL的基线准确率，而学习能力独立于表示质量，在任意标签集下都能发生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示的重要性，但对表示和学习能力的交互作用研究不足。本文假设这两个方面相互独立，旨在验证这一假设。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后在每个标签集上使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 学习确实发生在所有标签集上，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的影响。表示质量的优势在学习过程中保持稳定。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示和学习具有正交性，表示决定基线性能，学习能力独立于表示质量。这揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型对条件语句可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性敏感，但与人类判断存在差异，且模型规模增大不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前的研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，不清楚它们如何判断条件语句的可接受性。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索不如人类一致；更大的模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs能够整合概率和语义信息来判断条件可接受性，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模的增加并不能保证更好的对齐。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Method: 使用单层、双头、8M参数的Co⁴机器，采用近似O(N)的计算复杂度，在10M tokens上进行预训练。

Result: 在BabyLM挑战评估中，Co⁴在SuperGLUE任务的零样本和微调性能上表现优异：超越GPT-2在5/7零样本指标和6/7微调任务，超越GPT-BERT在4/7指标。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要重新思考主流深度学习范式和缩放定律，小模型在高效训练下也能达到优异性能。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two

greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在简单问题上产生不必要的冗长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错过解决方案，需要平衡推理效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：自适应冷启动阶段根据问题难度调整推理轨迹长度；自适应熵策略优化阶段使用高窗口熵标记作为探索触发器，结合分层熵奖励和动态KL控制。

Conclusion: ARES通过自适应推理机制有效平衡了简单和困难问题的处理，提高了多模态大模型的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的地位，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 受人类创造新词启发，研究如何通过引入新词来更好地理解和控制LLM，扩展新词学习的概念。

Method: 通过添加新词嵌入并训练示例来引入新词，不改变其他模型参数；使用自我言语化让模型解释新词含义；通过插件评估验证言语化效果。

Result: 新词可以控制奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念；模型能自我解释新词含义；发现机器专有同义词；能同时学习多个概念。

Conclusion: 新词学习是理解和控制LLM的有效方法，能实现概念操控和模型自我解释，为模型理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a

Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Method: 使用强化学习框架直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量关系，识别推理关键头，对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩常数KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，RLKV在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能接近未压缩结果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力头在推理模型中具有功能异质性，RLKV通过识别推理关键头实现高效KV缓存压缩，为推理模型的高效部署提供解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个基于多智能体协作的自进化框架，通过智能体间的交互学习实现无外部监督的自主改进，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自进化方法依赖外部奖励信号或LLM内部奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作实现自我进化的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS通过多智能体交互生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验表明CoMAS持续优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。消融研究证实了基于交互的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自进化提供了一个新颖有效的范式。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来应对预训练数据泄露问题，保持基准测试的有效性和可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据泄露导致基准测试失效，模型通过记忆而非真正泛化来获得高分，扭曲了模型比较和进展评估。

Method: 框架通过推断测试用例核心能力、生成保留原始目标的候选问答对、使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图、聚合多个模型反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例，通过上下文演示迭代生成更具挑战性的诊断案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用显示，ArenaBencher能产生经过验证的、多样化的、公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，提高难度同时保持测试目标对齐，改善模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架为基准测试与基础模型快速发展同步演进提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

TL;DR: 波兰消费者正转向在线保险购买，但偏好混合模式：在线工具用于研究和比较，传统代理人用于复杂决策。价格是主要决策因素，但信任和服务质量也很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究波兰消费者如何适应在线保险购买渠道，以及影响他们偏好的因素，为保险公司在数字化时代制定分销策略提供依据。

Method: 通过对100名具有不同人口统计特征的受访者进行结构化调查，探讨购买频率、渠道使用、价格敏感性、信任和决策行为。

Result: 结果显示向数字工具的明显转变，消费者重视在线平台的速度、便利性和透明度，特别是简单保险产品。但存在数据安全担忧、缺乏个人指导和理解保单条款困难等障碍。

Conclusion: 保险公司应投资于用户友好的数字体验，同时保留人工支持选项。建议战略性的全渠道整合，以满足多样化客户需求并减少数字排斥。

Abstract: This paper examines how Polish consumers are adapting to online insurance
purchasing channels and what factors influence their preferences. Drawing on a
structured survey of 100 respondents with varied demographic profiles, the
study explores purchasing frequency, channel usage, price sensitivity, trust,
and decision-making behaviors. Results indicate a clear shift toward digital
tools, with many consumers valuing the speed, convenience, and transparency of
online platforms, particularly for simple insurance products. However, barriers
remain, including concerns about data security, lack of personal guidance, and
difficulty understanding policy terms. A hybrid model is emerging, where online
tools are used for research and comparison, while traditional agents are
consulted for complex decisions. Respondents emphasized the importance of trust
and personal contact, showing that emotional and psychological factors still
play a role in digital adoption. Price was the dominant decision factor, but
many consumers also prioritized service quality and reliability. The study
concludes that insurers should invest in user-friendly digital experiences
while maintaining human support options. Strategic omnichannel integration is
recommended to meet diverse customer needs and reduce digital exclusion.
Limitations of the study include a modest sample size and focus on the Polish
market. Future research should investigate the role of AI in digital
distribution, segment preferences by insurance type, and analyze trends across
different regions or age groups. This paper adds empirical value to the
understanding of insurance distribution and consumer behavior in digitally
transforming financial markets.

TL;DR: 生成式AI通过降低边际成本、提高固定访问成本，同时压缩产品感知差异，导致企业向模板聚集，降低价格但增加市场集中度，形成价格下降与进入壁垒上升的政策悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何通过统一产品模板、降低边际成本但提高固定成本，影响市场竞争结构和产品多样性，解决AI带来的价格下降与市场集中度上升的悖论。

Method: 采用标准的两阶段差异化竞争框架，分析单一能力转变如何同时压缩感知差异、降低边际成本、提高固定访问成本，并扩展到多企业情形。

Result: 存在一个能力阈值，超过该阈值即使两家企业也无法覆盖固定成本；随着能力增长，可持续企业数量减少，市场集中度增加，但价格仍下降。

Conclusion: AI在降低价格的同时使市场进入更加困难，需要通过促进模板多样性和互操作性来保护市场竞争和产品多样性，同时享受AI的价格优势。

Abstract: Generative AI does more than cut costs. It pulls products toward a shared
template, making offerings look and feel more alike while making true
originality disproportionately expensive. We capture this centripetal force in
a standard two-stage differentiated-competition framework and show how a single
capability shift simultaneously compresses perceived differences, lowers
marginal cost and raises fixed access costs. The intuition is straightforward.
When buyers see smaller differences across products, the payoff to standing
apart shrinks just as the effort to do so rises, so firms cluster around the
template. Prices fall and customers become more willing to switch. But the same
homogenization also squeezes operating margins, and rising fixed outlays deepen
the squeeze. The combination yields a structural prediction. There is a
capability threshold at which even two firms cannot both cover fixed costs, and
in a many-firm extension the sustainable number of firms falls as capability
grows. Concentration increases, and prices still fall. Our results hold under
broader preference shapes, non-uniform consumer densities, outside options,
capability-dependent curvatures, and modest asymmetries. We translate the
theory into two sufficient statistics for enforcement. On the one hand, a
conduct statistic and a viability statistic. Transactions or platform rules
that strengthen template pull or raise fixed access and originality costs can
lower prices today yet push the market toward monoculture. Remedies that
broaden access and promote template plurality and interoperability preserve the
price benefits of AI while protecting entry and variety. The paper thus
reconciles a live policy paradox. AI can make prices lower and entry harder at
the same time. It prescribes what to measure to tell which force is dominant in
practice.

*Xiyuan Ren,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种数据融合方法，将观察到的移动枢纽使用情况整合到基于合成出行数据的模式选择模型中，用于评估移动枢纽对出行需求、模式转换、车辆行驶里程减少和消费者剩余增加的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市面临交通拥堵和服务不平等问题，移动枢纽提供了可扩展的解决方案，但评估其影响仍然具有挑战性，因为缺乏整合大规模出行模式与现实世界枢纽使用的行为模型。

Method: 采用数据融合方法，识别可能受移动枢纽影响的出行，构建多模式子选择集，使用现场调查数据和实际出行计数校准枢纽特定参数，将观察到的移动枢纽使用情况整合到基于合成出行数据的模式选择模型中。

Result: 在纽约州首府区的案例研究中，两个已实施的移动枢纽预计每天分别产生8.83和6.17次多模式出行，每年减少车辆行驶里程20.37和13.16千英里，每天分别增加消费者剩余4,000美元和1,742美元。

Conclusion: 位于城际走廊和城市边缘、支持停车换乘模式的移动枢纽候选点能够产生最显著的行为影响。

Abstract: As cities grapple with traffic congestion and service inequities, mobility
hubs offer a scalable solution to align increasing travel demand with
sustainability goals. However, evaluating their impacts remains challenging due
to the lack of behavioral models that integrate large-scale travel patterns
with real-world hub usage. This study presents a novel data fusion approach
that incorporates observed mobility hub usage into a mode choice model
estimated with synthetic trip data. We identify trips potentially affected by
mobility hubs and construct a multimodal sub-choice set, then calibrate
hub-specific parameters using on-site survey data and ground truth trip counts.
The enhanced model is used to evaluate mobility hub impacts on potential
demand, mode shift, reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and increased
consumer surplus (CS). We apply this method to a case study in the Capital
District, NY, using data from a survey conducted by the Capital District
Transportation Authority (CDTA) and a mode choice model estimated using Replica
Inc. synthetic data. The two implemented hubs located near UAlbany Downtown
Campus and in Downtown Cohoes are projected to generate 8.83 and 6.17
multimodal trips per day, reduce annual VMT by 20.37 and 13.16 thousand miles,
and increase daily CS by $4,000 and $1,742, respectively. An evaluation of
potential hub candidates in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy metropolitan area with
the estimated models demonstrates that hubs located along intercity corridors
and at urban peripheries, supporting park-and-ride P+R patterns, yield the most
significant behavioral impacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了精炼相关均衡概念，解决现有相关均衡精炼方法的局限性，提出一个基于调解者错误的新精炼框架。

Method: 通过引入调解者错误的概念来定义相关完美均衡(CPE)，提供CPE的对偶表示，并与Myerson(1986)的可接受相关均衡及Dhillon-Mertens(1996)的完美直接相关均衡进行比较分析。

Result: 在有限博弈中，CPE集合非空且构成凸集的有限并集，CPE不会给弱占优策略分配正概率，与现有两种相关均衡精炼方法存在差异。

Conclusion: 相关完美均衡(CPE)是一个有效的相关均衡精炼概念，具有良好性质且与现有精炼方法不同，为相关均衡理论提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: We propose a refinement of correlated equilibrium based on mediator errors,
called correlated perfect equilibrium (CPE). In finite games, the set of CPE is
nonempty and forms a finite union of convex sets. Like perfect equilibrium, a
CPE never assigns positive probability to any weakly dominated strategy. We
provide a dual representation of CPE and demonstrate how it differs from two
existing refinements of correlated equilibrium--acceptable correlated
equilibrium (Myerson, 1986) and perfect direct correlated equilibrium
(Dhillon-Mertens, 1996)--through examples.

from a finite set. We characterize the equilibrium outcomes of the game and
compare them with commitment outcomes in information design. We provide

identify environments in which the sender does not benefit from commitment
power. Our findings offer insights into the interchangeability of verifiability
and commitment in applied settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含随机波动率均值效应和时变偏度的贝叶斯向量自回归模型，该模型允许波动率和偏度直接影响宏观经济变量，在实证应用中表现出优于现有模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型未能充分考虑波动率和偏度对宏观经济变量的直接影响，需要开发能够同时捕捉这两种风险因素影响的模型。

Method: 构建贝叶斯向量自回归模型，包含随机波动率均值效应和时变偏度，使用吉布斯采样算法进行后验推断，应用于美国和英国的季度数据。

Result: 实证结果显示偏度冲击对产出、通胀和利差具有显著经济影响，且往往超过波动率冲击的影响；在伪实时预测中优于现有模型；能提供更精确的尾部风险度量。

Conclusion: 时变偏度的纳入对于捕捉宏观金融风险和提升预测性能至关重要，标准随机波动率模型往往会高估不确定性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) with stochastic
volatility-in-mean and time-varying skewness. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed model allows both volatility and skewness to directly affect
macroeconomic variables. We provide a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior
inference and apply the model to quarterly data for the US and the UK.
Empirical results show that skewness shocks have economically significant
effects on output, inflation and spreads, often exceeding the impact of
volatility shocks. In a pseudo-real-time forecasting exercise, the proposed
model outperforms existing alternatives in many cases. Moreover, the model
produces sharper measures of tail risk, revealing that standard stochastic
volatility models tend to overstate uncertainty. These findings highlight the
importance of incorporating time-varying skewness for capturing macro-financial
risks and improving forecast performance.

Conclusion: TAD 为大规模经验模型与形式验证之间提供了一个实用的桥梁，通过验证导向的解码方案实现了知识对齐的神经语言生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过将LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转化为上下文状态表示，使智能体能够推理攻击者意图，结合MAPPO算法学习复杂协作策略，在保持物理过程稳定性的同时实现高效威胁检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的日益集成使关键网络物理系统面临传统防御系统难以检测的多阶段复杂攻击，这些系统缺乏上下文感知能力，无法有效应对现代威胁。

Method: 提出L2M-AID框架，深度融合LLM和MARL两种AI范式：使用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转化为丰富的上下文状态表示，使智能体能够推理攻击者意图；采用MAPPO多智能体强化学习算法学习复杂协作策略；奖励函数设计平衡安全目标（威胁消除）和操作需求，明确惩罚破坏物理过程稳定性的行动。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架生成的新型合成数据集上进行广泛实验，L2M-AID显著优于传统IDS、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体RL基线，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提高四倍，在保持物理过程稳定性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式，通过LLM增强的多智能体强化学习方法实现了自适应和弹性安全防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思维语言模型为何优于基础模型，明确其性能提升是来自学习全新推理能力还是更有效地利用已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法来发现思维模型中可解释的推理行为；在三个基础模型和四个思维模型上使用GSM8K和MATH500数据集进行测试。

Result: 混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思维模型91%的性能差距，仅需引导12%的token；提供了一种因果测试方法来验证基础模型中现有推理机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 思维模型的训练过程：预训练阶段模型获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时机高效部署这些机制，从而实现推理计算的高效利用。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化和连续的护理方法。

Method: 使用AI进行频繁的低水平体验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，提出心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为个性化心理健康护理的变革性框架。

Result: AI能够高效进行患者体验采样，促进诊断协调，为动态适应个体患者需求和不断变化的条件提供可能。

Conclusion: 心理健康护理将从连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样中受益，提高治疗的可及性和有效性，MHDTs框架为个性化心理健康护理提供了变革性方向。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Method: 采用分层架构，由管理者智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人工反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空预测框架，通过引入整合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性的SpatioSemantic专家，在交通预测任务上显著提升了性能。研究发现，策略性专家选择优于简单集成，较少的精心设计专家比复杂多专家集成表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测方法如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。需要开发能够同时考虑物理拓扑和数据驱动特征的增强框架。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新型SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合。采用策略性专家选择而非简单集成聚合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs 3.14），在PEMS BAY上提升4.1%（1.65 vs 1.72）。最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+降低53.1%。

Conclusion: 较少但精心设计的专家策略优于复杂的多专家集成，实现了最先进的性能，同时具有优越的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLMs的推理能力与时间序列分析工具结合，避免知识泄漏和幻觉问题，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，经常出现幻觉或知识泄漏问题，需要专门设计的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: TS-Agent让LLMs专注于证据收集和推理合成，将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，并使用自批判和质量门进行迭代优化。

Result: 在基准测试中，TS-Agent在理解任务上达到SOTA LLMs水平，在推理任务上显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法避免了多模态对齐训练，保持时间序列的原始形式，确保可解释性和可验证性，有效缓解了知识泄漏和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理的能力。

Method: 使用多个LLM模型（包括ChatGPT o3）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，分析其回答查询的准确性。

Result: 不同LLM在准确性和有效性方面表现各异，但总体上LLM能够有效理解流程模型并回答多层级问题，且表现出类人特性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，具备深度推理和流程分析优化的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案归类为高风险系统，需要正式的伦理风险管理流程来确保可信AI要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，使用Minizinc建模语言，比较MIP、SAT和CP三种求解方法。

Result: 通过实验研究分析了三种方法在性能、表达能力和可扩展性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 从方法学局限性出发，提出了将Minizinc模型集成到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作方向。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现热门路径，包含搜索现有热门路径和生成新路径两个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出的能力使其有望应用于地理空间问题。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含两个阶段：SEARCH阶段识别现有热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种有效且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Conclusion: RECAP为合规应用中的PII检测提供了可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过插入最小必要问题来阻止多智能体系统中消息传递的错误传播，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会传播到整个链）而经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i) 从整理的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；(ii) 监督策略决定何时/什么/向谁/如何提问；(iii) 使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，但研究发现现有评估指标存在系统性低估问题，需要更准确的评估方法和性能提升技术。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 新方法显著提升了模型性能：SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过估计的人类表现，在16个数据集上均实现一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，AI模型在组合推理方面的隐藏能力被有效释放，推动了组合推理前沿的发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Method: 开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离策略评估的模型无关安全OPL方法）和DEPL框架（利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化）

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时实现新物品探索

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，实现对新物品的有效探索

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可复现的模拟框架来评估多模态环境中生成式智能体的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前智能体在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%，且容易过度信任误导性图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使智能体能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估。

Method: 开发了可复现的模拟框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示智能体能够检测直接的多模态矛盾，但经常无法将局部修订与全局安全对齐，纠正不安全计划的成功率仅为55%。在三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的测试中，不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在关键限制，45%的不安全行动在被误导性视觉配对时被接受，表明智能体过度信任图像。该研究为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，通过实时监测系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，生成反映瞬时状态动态的奖励，解决了现有方法中全局稀疏奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将STL奖励函数融入强化学习的方法只能提供全局或部分路径的评估，无法准确累积局部变化奖励，导致稀疏的全局奖励可能引起训练不收敛和不稳定。

Method: 采用在线因果监控方法，在每个控制步骤持续监测系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的量化距离，生成反映瞬时状态动态的奖励。同时提供了因果语义的平滑近似以克服不连续性，使其适用于深度强化学习方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中的连续控制基准测试上，实验结果表明该方法优于现有的相关STL引导RL方法，为深度RL提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 基于在线因果语义的STL引导RL方法能够提供更有效的奖励信号，改善强化学习在实时安全关键系统中的控制策略合成性能。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

TL;DR: 提出了oMeBench基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在有机反应机制推理方面的能力，发现当前模型在化学直觉方面表现良好，但在多步推理方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有机反应机制是理解化学反应性和设计新分子的基础，但现有大语言模型是否真正具备化学推理能力尚不明确。

Method: 构建了包含10,000多个注释机制步骤的oMeBench基准测试，并提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行精细评分。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面表现不佳。通过提示策略和微调，性能可提升50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严格基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合分层引用图来生成更全面、结构更好的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成综述的方法通常直接从大量相关论文中提取内容进行总结，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合分层引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），结合层内水平搜索和跨层垂直深度遍历，生成多级摘要并整合为结构化综述大纲，最后通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家评估和LLM作为评判者的评估中都优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，特别是在分类连贯性和研究进展理解方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

TL;DR: MMIA是一种基于LLM的医疗智能代理架构，通过形式化可验证的推理过程确保可靠性，在医疗管理任务中实现超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，并能通过RAG模式显著降低处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在医疗领域容易出现事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为在这个高风险领域中错误是不可接受的。

Method: 采用递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，建立可验证推理链，并引入"引导"模式将已验证推理链存储为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域验证中，MMIA实现超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，显著优于基线LLMs，RAG模式预计可降低约85%的平均处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要进展，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Motivation: 现有图域适应方法严重依赖源域数据，但在隐私和安全考虑下源域数据往往不可用，这推动了测试时图域适应的发展。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架：压缩节点表征为紧凑潜在特征，使用图扩散过程建模图恢复，量化模块编码恢复特征为离散标记，微调LLM作为生成式恢复器，并引入强化学习过程优化恢复质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将测试时图域适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，并利用LLM的生成能力，GRAIL框架在无需源域数据的情况下成功实现了图域适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Motivation: 现有分解方法是启发式的，依赖代理或手动分解，导致LLM在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题。

Method: ACONIC框架将任务建模为约束问题，使用形式复杂度度量来指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，通过复杂度度量分解后，代理性能显著提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: 基于复杂度度量的系统化分解方法能有效提升LLM在复杂任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

TL;DR: 提出了Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO等强化学习算法在推理任务中的局限性，提升小模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型rollout响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对样本中获取知识。需要一种能充分利用所有样本并引导模型学习正确推理方向的方法。

Method: GCPO方法引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。该方法能充分利用每个样本，并让模型在训练中模仿参考答案的解题策略。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO通过引入外部参考答案有效解决了现有强化学习方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和模型推理泛化能力，为小模型推理能力提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 研究对抗环境中智能体面临的关键战略权衡：获取信息增强态势感知的同时可能暴露自身位置，增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈模型和SHADOW框架，结合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测，使用多头部序贯强化学习训练追捕者的移动和通信策略。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线获得更高成功率，消融研究证实时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市级网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理协调区域间交通流分布，以及局部导航代理生成符合全局指令的局部自适应路线，采用双奖励结构的协同推理优化机制进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基准方法中，在城市规模旅行效率和拥堵缓解方面表现最优。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

Conclusion: Augur框架通过充分利用LLM的因果推理能力，在提高预测准确性的同时提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval框架为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面有效的工具，填补了现有评估方法的空白，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as

### [137] [Towards Meaningful Transparency in Civic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07889)
*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出"有意义透明度"概念，旨在让公众能够理解并参与影响其生活的AI系统决策过程，将理解与行动可能性联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在政府服务中存在偏见和错误输出，透明度实践往往聚焦技术对象，难以让公众理解且缺乏行动可能性。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义透明度的理论框架，强调透明度应连接公众理解与行动能力。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度能够增强公众对AI系统的参与度，将技术透明度转化为实际可操作的理解和行动能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

### [138] [Profit Mirage: Revisiting Information Leakage in LLM-based Financial Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07920)
*Xiangyu Li,Yawen Zeng,Xiaofen Xing,Jin Xu,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了LLM金融代理存在的"利润幻象"问题，即回测收益因LLM信息泄露而在知识窗口结束后消失，并提出了FactFin框架来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理存在信息泄露问题，导致回测收益在模型知识窗口结束后大幅下降，需要开发能够学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果的稳健方法。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动迫使代理学习因果驱动因素。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在样本外泛化方面超越所有基线，提供了优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效解决了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，通过反事实学习提升了模型的稳健性和泛化能力。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

### [139] [Enabling Personalized Long-term Interactions in LLM-based Agents through Persistent Memory and User Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07925)
*Rebecca Westhäußer,Wolfgang Minker,Sebatian Zepf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，用于实现个性化长期交互的LLM智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在个性化交互方面存在局限，RAG虽然增强了上下文感知但缺乏结合用户特定数据的机制，现有个性化研究多为概念性而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一个性化定义推导技术需求，结合多智能体协作和多源检索等模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore等指标，并通过5天试点用户研究获得关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究表明集成持久记忆和用户档案有潜力提高LLM智能体的适应性和感知个性化，为未来工作提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 提出CGA-Agent混合框架，结合遗传算法与多智能体协调机制，用于加密货币交易策略参数优化，在动态金融市场中实现自适应优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场具有极端波动性、非平稳动态和复杂微观结构模式，使得传统参数优化方法根本不足，需要新的自适应优化方法。

Method: 开发CGA-Agent混合框架，整合遗传算法与智能多智能体协调机制，融入实时市场微观结构智能和自适应策略性能反馈，动态指导进化过程。

Result: 在三种加密货币上的实证评估显示，在总回报和风险调整指标上都实现了系统性和统计显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了静态优化方法的局限性，为动态金融环境中的交易策略参数优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets present formidable challenges for trading strategy
optimization due to extreme volatility, non-stationary dynamics, and complex
microstructure patterns that render conventional parameter optimization methods
fundamentally inadequate. We introduce Cypto Genetic Algorithm Agent
(CGA-Agent), a pioneering hybrid framework that synergistically integrates
genetic algorithms with intelligent multi-agent coordination mechanisms for
adaptive trading strategy parameter optimization in dynamic financial
environments. The framework uniquely incorporates real-time market
microstructure intelligence and adaptive strategy performance feedback through
intelligent mechanisms that dynamically guide evolutionary processes,
transcending the limitations of static optimization approaches. Comprehensive
empirical evaluation across three cryptocurrencies demonstrates systematic and
statistically significant performance improvements on both total returns and
risk-adjusted metrics.

*Pengkun Jiao,Yiming Jin,Jianhui Yang,Chenhe Dong,Zerui Huang,Shaowei Yao,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TaoSR-SHE框架，通过步进式混合检查强化学习解决电商搜索相关性分析中的推理一致性和泛化能力问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式（SFT、DPO、RLVR）在长尾查询泛化、细粒度监督和稀疏反馈方面存在局限性，影响推理的逻辑一致性和性能。

Method: 核心是SRPO强化学习算法，结合生成式步进奖励模型和人工验证器提供步级奖励，并采用多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习技术。

Result: 在真实搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了大规模电商环境下的性能，还增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

### [142] [VoiceAgentBench: Are Voice Assistants ready for agentic tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07978)
*Dhruv Jain,Harshit Shukla,Gautam Rajeev,Ashish Kulkarni,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了VoiceAgentBench基准测试，用于评估语音语言模型在真实语音代理场景中的表现，涵盖多语言、文化理解和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注孤立能力如转录或问答，缺乏对多语言、文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估。

Method: 创建包含5,500+合成语音查询的基准，支持英语、印地语和5种印度语言，使用基于说话人嵌入的采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 该基准暴露了当前语音语言模型的关键局限性，为改进多语言和文化敏感的语音代理系统提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

### [143] [ReInAgent: A Context-Aware GUI Agent Enabling Human-in-the-Loop Mobile Task Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07988)
*Haitao Jia,Ming He,Zimo Yin,Likang Wu,Jianping Fan,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多代理框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作解决移动GUI代理在信息困境下的适应性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过度强调自主操作，忽视了用户参与的重要性，导致在模糊、动态变化和冲突的任务场景中无法适应真实用户需求

Method: 集成三个专门代理：信息管理代理负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策代理负责冲突感知规划，反思代理负责任务反思和信息一致性验证

Result: 在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，ReInAgent比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率，能更有效地解决信息困境并产生更符合用户偏好的结果

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的用户-代理协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂现实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和显著噪声，尽管能够高保真重建数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与简单数值输入空间正交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及它们在数值表示中的实际表现。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，测试来自OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI的模型，分析嵌入空间的性质。

Result: 虽然重建保真度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，且随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型在表示数值时存在根本性缺陷，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [145] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段（思考阶段和最终答案阶段）施加不同的熵控制，来平衡推理模型的响应长度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 通过系统实证分析发现模型熵与响应长度存在正相关关系，基于此提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚过高熵以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度探索。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并展现出超出训练分布的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR提供了一种无需显式长度目标或严格截断规则的自适应长度控制方法，有效平衡了推理模型的简洁性和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，W^V则相对稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保留任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保持通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过考虑注意力参数的功能差异，为参数高效微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言描述转换为逼真、交互式的3D自动驾驶测试场景，解决了现有方法在命令准确性和场景真实性之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以在命令准确性和真实驾驶环境之间取得平衡，往往通过简化场景为2D或非交互式模拟来降低复杂度，牺牲了场景的真实性。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，通过反馈校准模块提升生成精度，确保输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐，并利用场景描述和自动驾驶模型约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多样化关键性场景（危险场景ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全场景：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块将碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim通过弥合自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距，促进了高保真场景的创建，有效提升了自动驾驶的安全测试和训练效果。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

TL;DR: 提出了多条件符合选择（MCCS）算法，将符合选择扩展到多条件场景，包括合取和析取条件，实现了有限样本FDR控制的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学和大语言模型对齐等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有的符合选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，为合取条件引入了具有区域单调性的新型非符合性评分，为析取条件引入了全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，其在多样化条件组合、不同现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS方法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，解决了现有方法在多条件场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征来评估在线评论质量，通过模拟人类研究过程迭代生成特征假设并实现工具自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域依赖和动态的概念。传统手工特征方法难以跨领域扩展，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: AutoQual框架模拟人类研究过程：通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现特征操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。该框架将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征。

Result: 在拥有亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示该方法有效：每位用户平均查看评论数增加0.79%，评论阅读者的转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估的挑战，提供了一个通用的框架来将隐性知识转化为显性特征，在真实电商环境中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，需要一种能够系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理的框架，确保AI系统的真正公平性。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断其代理，构建捕获偏见模式完整结构的sigma代数G。然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示，生成与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性。

Result: 该方法保证了真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关性，在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平性，其中ZIP代码等代理会揭示种族信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可证明且数学基础扎实的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统，通过将偏见建模为sigma代数之间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平变换。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 研究调查语言模型的风险规避可操纵性，发现虽然某些模型与人类行为有一定对齐，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心的可操纵性测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 通过检查语言模型在不同经济场景下复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型与人类行为有一定对齐，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索和响应生成来解决开放域对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问与响应延迟之间的基本矛盾：轻量级模型延迟低但缺乏推理深度，而工具增强的ReAct代理虽然提高了事实准确性，但同步执行会在检索过程中阻塞交互。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充分性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）和异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制保持对话流畅性。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低响应延迟的同时保持了高质量的对话响应，为开放域对话系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法来评估和增强大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过查询组合构建多步骤推理任务，发现现有模型在长视野推理中存在显著性能下降，并利用该数据通过强化学习提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要新的评估方法来弥补这一不足。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含相互依赖问题的复杂多步骤推理任务的长视野推理基准。

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的推理模型也存在显著性能下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和难以在多个问题间合理分配思考预算的问题。使用R-HORIZON数据进行强化学习训练后，不仅在多视野推理任务上大幅提升，还在标准推理任务上提高了7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，技术可能编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。虽然语言、视觉和编码能力基准很常见，但缺乏可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，从公共工件和独立评估中编码可验证实践，明确处理"未知"证据。

Result: 报告了试点提供商结果，并将AIPI与邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架进行对比。该指数旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践。

Conclusion: AIPI为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供了可比较的证据，旨在推动AI系统向更包容、参与式的治理模式发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重且存在不一致性风险，计算复杂度高。

Method: TTM包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。

Result: 该方法确保设计一致性，最小化认知努力，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2降至m个参数，与经典卡片法兼容。

Conclusion: TTM是有效的多标准决策框架，开发了基于Web的工具展示其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解能力。让AI具备因果意识可以提升性能，深入理解环境运行机制。

Method: 智能体在隐藏因果DAG的环境中通过重复干预来学习因果结构，使用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下都优于观测方法，通常能以零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战性配置中比最佳基线高0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: 通过主动干预学习因果结构的方法比纯观测方法更有效，DODO算法能准确推断环境中的因果机制。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反思表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈纳入选择机制，促进潜在表示间密集依赖关系的学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上带来显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，相比最新进展，用8倍更少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升推理任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性面临严重威胁，传统单步后门攻击已无法满足长期控制需求。

Method: CoTri采用有序触发序列，初始触发后从环境中获取后续触发，实现多步操控，使智能体偏离原定任务。

Result: 实验显示CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率，同时保持接近零的误触发率，并意外提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和环境干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了智能体内的稳定多步控制，在提升智能体固有鲁棒性和任务能力的同时，使攻击更加隐蔽，带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware

Method: 系统分析八个推理模型在五个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的监督微调数据集，并提出问题感知的早停方法。

Result: 反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步数主要提升首次答案正确率；提出的早停方法减少24.5%的推理标记，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思行为对纠正错误答案的作用有限，通过动态截断反思可以显著提高推理效率，同时保持较高的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大量采样时可能误导推理边界评估，因为离散答案空间中随机猜测的成功率会随着采样次数增加而提高，无法真实反映模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，通过可靠性阈值来区分真正的推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估多个RLVR模型显示，相比Pass@1，流行算法的相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地评估语言模型的推理能力，特别是在离散答案空间任务中，避免了Pass@k指标在大采样量时的误导性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Motivation: 传统消费者调研成本高昂且存在面板偏见和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者提供了替代方案，但直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: 语义相似度评分方法：从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持传统调研指标和可解释性的同时，实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务上表现优异，可作为即插即用模块在实际应用中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过强化学习驱动的搜索代理有效提升了检索质量，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于隐藏状态有效秩的LLM幻觉检测方法，通过分析多输出和不同层的表示来量化不确定性，无需额外知识或模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM幻觉检测是其可信部署的基本挑战，现有不确定性驱动框架不够充分，需要更深入理解模型内部推理过程。

Method: 通过测量来自多个模型输出和不同层的隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示的光谱分析提供可解释的语义变化洞察。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中稳健泛化，为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了理论优雅性和实践效率，证明了在内部（单个响应表示）和外部（不同响应）同时量化不确定性的必要性，为LLM幻觉检测提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 使用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比学习目标进行视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试(BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA)上表现优于或与多模态基线方法相当。动态门控发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督即可为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战约束的限制(如全局图像嵌入造成的信息瓶颈和数据集分割带来的训练不稳定性)，动态门控被证明是高效多模态学习的强大工具，在严格约束下同时提供可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于大语言模型的编码代理，通过集成领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索来解决机器学习工程任务中的局限性，在MLE-Bench上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在AutoML和Kaggle等机器学习工程场景中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有MLE方法受限于线性或树状搜索结构，无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自我进化能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 提出AutoMLGen代理，集成领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）方法，在保持树状探索的同时嵌入图结构，支持动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过结合领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索，有效解决了机器学习工程任务中的知识转移和搜索效率问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 解决模型在多轮交互任务中需要战略性信息收集的问题，避免过度思考或偏离主题，学会何时停止收集信息并做出决策

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一条轨迹在适当时候终止，另一条相同轨迹在不应终止时继续，通过语言推理解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs在信息收集过程中适时终止，通过反事实推理训练提升模型决策效率

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Motivation: 当前语言智能体主要依赖专家数据进行监督微调，但专家数据范围有限、环境多样性不足，难以扩展和泛化。需要找到介于监督学习和强化学习之间的中间方案。

Method: 提出"早期经验"范式，使用智能体自身交互数据，研究两种策略：1) 隐式世界建模，利用收集的状态来锚定策略在环境动态中；2) 自我反思，从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策。

Conclusion: 早期经验是介于模仿学习和完全经验驱动智能体之间的实用桥梁，能够显著改进语言智能体的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在连续微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，探索如何在获得新技能的同时保持原有能力。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时监控八个保留基准测试的性能；识别输出token分布的偏移，并提出两种简单有效的调优方法：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up投影层。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段可以部分恢复；提出的两种调优方法在获得强目标增益的同时，能很大程度上保留保留任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性更新特定层，可以有效平衡大型多模态模型学习新技能和保持原有能力的需求，为连续学习提供了简单而稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器人，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提供LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据；潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子；自我表征是视觉静默的。通过经验分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形的独特性。

Result: 建立了双层级发射机制，其中ε(a)携带认知内容，形成了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略π_self(A)。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS能够有效捕捉模态异质性，显著提高漏洞共利用攻击预测性能，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Conclusion: MultiFair有效解决了多模态医疗分类中的不平衡和公平性问题，通过双重梯度调制实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了两种深度学习模型(GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT)在作物产量预测中的跨区域泛化能力，发现GNN-RNN在异地分布条件下表现更优，训练速度更快，而空间-时间对齐比模型复杂度对泛化性能更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化日益破坏农业系统，准确的作物产量预测对粮食安全至关重要。虽然深度学习模型在利用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示出潜力，但其跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力（对实际部署至关重要）尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 使用覆盖2017-2022年1200多个美国县的大规模CropNet数据集，在现实的异地分布条件下对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT两种最先进模型进行基准测试，采用跨七个USDA农场资源区域的留一簇交叉验证和年度预测场景。

Result: GNN-RNN在跨区域转移性方面表现出优越的泛化能力，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在异地分布条件下性能急剧下降。Heartland和Northern Great Plains等区域显示稳定的转移动态，而Prairie Gateway区域在两个模型和作物中都表现不佳。GNN-RNN的训练速度比MMST-ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 空间-时间对齐（而不仅仅是模型复杂度或数据规模）是稳健泛化的关键，需要透明的异地分布评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，该模型显著优于现有的顶级模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，该研究的观察、指标以及数据收集和筛选流水线有助于未来在内核生成任务中获得更好的数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在推理时迭代特定层来增强语言模型的推理能力，无需改变模型架构或参数数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现推理任务的关键计算集中在有限层中，因此希望通过迭代这些层来增强推理能力

Method: 在中间训练阶段训练模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，并在推理时对选定层进行迭代计算

Result: 在17个推理基准测试中取得显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于线性上下文赌博机中付费观测问题的高效Best-of-Both-Worlds算法，在对抗性设置中达到最小最大最优遗憾，在随机设置中保证多对数遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究线性上下文赌博机中的付费观测问题，学习者可以选择支付固定成本来观察任何臂的损失，旨在设计一个在对抗性和随机设置中都表现良好的算法。

Method: 基于Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架，通过矩阵几何重采样构建高效估计器，设计了计算高效的Best-of-Both-Worlds算法。

Result: 算法在对抗性设置中达到Θ(T^{2/3})的最小最大最优遗憾，在（被破坏的）随机机制中保证多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了BOBW算法框架到"困难问题"，为所考虑的设置量身定制了分析技术，实现了在两种设置下的最优性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于偏好反馈的在线路由方法，能够在训练时模拟部署环境中的部分反馈限制，支持在测试时无需重新训练即可调整性能/成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模部署LLM时，需要自适应路由来平衡模型性能和成本。现有路由器大多依赖离线训练，假设所有候选模型的标签都可用，但这在部署中不成立，因为只能观察到所选模型的结果。

Method: 将问题建模为基于上下文特征的上下文多臂赌博机问题，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，根据每个新提示自适应地做出路由决策，而不是依赖完整的离线监督信息。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法始终优于强离线路由器至少12.46%，优于最大LLM至少2.45%，并且对未见任务具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BaRP方法成功弥合了训练和部署之间的差距，在部分反馈限制下训练路由器，同时支持偏好可调的推理，为LLM部署提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数无关的联邦时序差分学习方法，在马尔可夫数据下实现了最优的收敛速率，适用于异构环境的联邦学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦强化学习方法在马尔可夫数据下需要依赖未知问题参数才能达到最优收敛速率，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了双时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习算法，结合Polyak-Ruppert平均技术，构建参数无关的解决方案。

Result: 该方法在平均奖励和折扣奖励设置下均能证明达到最优的O~(1/NT)收敛速率，其中N是智能体数量，T是迭代次数。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了联邦时序差分学习在马尔可夫数据下的理论空白，为异构环境下的联邦强化学习提供了实用的参数无关解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: MoGU是一种用于时间序列预测的混合专家框架，通过高斯分布建模专家输出，并使用基于不确定性的门控机制来提升预测准确性和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合专家方法只提供点估计，无法量化预测不确定性。在时间序列预测中，可靠的不确定性估计对于决策制定至关重要。

Method: 将每个专家的输出建模为高斯分布，使用专家估计的方差（而非传统基于输入的门控网络）来确定其对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统混合专家设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU通过基于不确定性的门控机制成功提升了时间序列预测的准确性和可靠性，为决策提供了更可信的不确定性估计。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

TL;DR: 提出metabeta模型，使用基于transformer的神经网络进行贝叶斯混合效应回归，相比传统MCMC方法显著提高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯混合效应回归使用MCMC方法计算成本高且分析困难，需要更高效的推理方法

Method: 使用基于transformer的神经网络模型，通过模拟数据集进行预训练，实现计算成本从推理时转移到预训练时的摊销

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上达到与MCMC方法相当的稳定性能，但所需时间大幅减少

Conclusion: metabeta模型为贝叶斯混合效应回归提供了一种高效替代方案，显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料设计中需要寻找具有特定性能的材料，但随着设计变量增加，搜索空间呈指数增长，使得合成和验证每个材料的性能变得不切实际且耗时。传统机器学习方法在训练数据非均匀随机采样时表现不佳。

Method: 建议使用张量补全作为替代模型来加速材料设计，特别针对训练数据来自非均匀随机采样的场景。

Result: 实验显示，在偏置采样情况下，张量补全比高斯过程和XGBoost等经典ML方法表现更优，R²提高约5%。在均匀随机采样情况下，张量补全仍能提供可比较的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全是在非均匀采样场景下加速材料设计的一种有效方法，特别是在机械性能优化的晶格结构设计中。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Motivation: 肺癌是美国第三大常见癌症和主要癌症死因，虽然吸烟是主要风险因素，但不吸烟者和家族聚集研究显示存在遗传成分。GWAS发现的遗传生物标志物有望用于评估肺癌风险。

Method: HEMERA框架应用可解释Transformer深度学习处理GWAS单核苷酸多态性数据，引入加性位置编码、神经基因型嵌入和精炼变异过滤，使用事后可解释性模块基于分层集成梯度归因模型预测。

Result: 在27,254名百万退伍军人计划参与者数据上训练，HEMERA实现了超过99%的AUC得分，模型预测能够强烈对齐已知肺癌风险位点。

Conclusion: 这些发现支持使用透明、可生成假设的模型进行个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Conclusion: 强化学习框架能够有效优化可穿戴设备的任务卸载决策，在能量消耗和任务完成时间之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Conclusion: SurpMark是一种有效的基于参考的检测器，能够在实际约束下可靠地检测机器生成文本

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Motivation: 传统时间序列分析难以处理复杂的时间依赖性和跨通道交互，受人类视觉检查模式的启发，探索将视觉表示融入自动化分析以提升性能。

Method: 将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，使用时间感知的视觉补丁对齐策略，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Conclusion: 将视觉模态与预训练语言模型结合，为实现稳健和可泛化的时间序列分析提供了潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,

### [192] [Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536)
*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FairSpecTemp方法从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，确保连接不偏向敏感属性，包含两种变体：一种直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱偏差间接促进公平估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往表现出对某些群体对的连接偏好，这种有偏连接会加剧甚至导致下游基于图的任务的不公平处理。

Method: 提出了Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp)方法，包含两种变体：一种利用图平稳性的交换特性直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱中的偏差来隐式鼓励公平估计。

Result: 方法具有高概率性能界限，在公平性和准确性之间产生条件权衡，分析表明恢复公平图时不必牺牲准确性。在合成和真实数据集上的评估证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp能够有效估计公平图，两种变体各有优势，为图数据公平性提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著节省计算成本，通过目标数字孪生实现感兴趣量的高效长期动态预测，完全绕过完整流场仿真。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了两层神经网络中dropout在大宽度极限下的渐近行为，揭示了五个不同的非退化相，发现dropout的惩罚效应只在极小学习率下存在，而在较大学习率下等效于随机几何技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解dropout在大规模神经网络中的作用，特别是作为理解dropout在大规模神经网络中角色的第一步。

Method: 使用均值场初始化尺度，研究两层神经网络中带有dropout的梯度下降的大宽度渐近行为，结合均值场粒子系统和随机过程的工具进行收敛证明。

Result: 获得了丰富的渐近相图，包含五个不同的非退化相，发现dropout的惩罚效应仅在O(1/宽度)量级的极小学习率下存在，较大学习率下消失。

Conclusion: 研究结果为重新理论理解大规模神经网络中的dropout奠定了基础，揭示了dropout在不同学习率下的等效行为。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Result: 在SymbolicGPT的双变量数据集上，扩散生成方法在使用相似编码器和变换器架构时，相比自回归模型在某些指标上表现更好

Conclusion: 扩散生成方法为基于神经网络的符号回归开辟了新的研究机会，能够提供与自回归生成相当甚至在某些方面更好的性能

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Conclusion: 识别了LNNs与RNNs的共性与差异，总结了各自的不足与挑战，指出未来研究方向特别是提高LNN可扩展性以促进其在更广泛复杂场景中的应用。

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出ExpA（扩展动作空间）方法，将环境交互从语言中解耦，让LLM能够在语言环境和外部环境之间切换，并使用EARL强化学习算法来优化在扩展动作空间中的探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的环境交互必须通过预定义格式的文本进行，这使模型的语言既要负责推理又要负责控制，且需要外部解析器。需要将环境交互从语言中解耦。

Method: 提出ExpA方法，内部化环境交互到扩展动作空间；使用EARL强化学习算法，结合反事实策略优化来促进在扩展动作空间中的有效探索。

Result: 在多轮交互和条件规划任务中，EARL优于词汇约束动作的基线方法；在计算器多任务学习中表现稳健；在部分观察排序问题中达到100%的Sort-4准确率，并自我发现与经典设计相竞争的高效算法。

Conclusion: ExpA方法成功将环境交互从语言中解耦，EARL强化学习使LLM能够在扩展动作空间中有效探索，在多任务环境中表现优异，并能自我发现高效算法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图机器学习已有成熟框架，但时序图ML缺乏可比的基础设施。现有时序图库通常针对特定架构，难以支持多样化模型，且连续时间和离散时间方法之间存在鸿沟，限制了直接比较和思想交流。

Method: 开发TGM时序图建模库，统一连续时间和离散时间动态图方法，提供动态节点特征的一流支持、时间粒度转换功能，并原生处理链接级、节点级和图级任务。

Result: TGM在多个模型、数据集和任务上相比广泛使用的DyGLib实现了平均7.8倍加速，在图离散化方面相比现有实现实现了平均175倍加速。此外，TGM还开启了动态图属性预测和时间驱动训练范式等新的研究可能性。

Conclusion: TGM填补了时序图机器学习基础设施的空白，不仅显著提升了计算效率，还通过统一连续时间和离散时间方法，为先前难以研究的问题打开了大门。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

Motivation: 解决铁路轨道间接监测中检测小尺寸瞬态异常的挑战，克服复杂车辆动力学、信号噪声和标记数据稀缺等问题。

Method: 引入渐进式合成数据基准测试，提出注意力聚焦Transformer模型，通过自注意力机制训练，从学习到的注意力权重偏差中推导异常分数。

Result: Transformer模型普遍优于其他方法，但所有模型都对高频局部噪声敏感；所提模型在准确性上与最先进方案相当，推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 未来iSHM模型需要增强噪声鲁棒性，基于注意力的高效方法为开发实用车载异常检测系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

Conclusion: DGTEN统一框架在动态信任评估中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

Conclusion: 需要更全面的评估框架来指导LLM遗忘方法的设计和评估，本文提供了全栈式的重新审视和可操作的指导建议。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次建立了对抗性多臂老虎机网络干扰(MABNI)中遗憾最小化与推断准确性之间权衡的理论帕累托前沿，并提出了EXP3-N-CS算法来平衡这一权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MABNI研究主要关注遗憾最小化，但过度关注最优臂会损害次优臂的推断准确性。虽然单单元场景中已有初步研究，但在MABNI背景下这一挑战更加显著。

Method: 建立了对抗性MABNI中遗憾最小化与推断准确性权衡的理论帕累托前沿，提出了EXP3-N-CS算法，该算法包含任意时间有效的渐近置信序列。

Result: 首次在对抗性MABNI中建立了理论帕累托前沿，证明了EXP3-N-CS算法能够有效平衡遗憾最小化与推断准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 本文为MABNI中的权衡问题提供了理论基础和实用算法，填补了现有研究在推断准确性方面的空白。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类间分离(ICS)的新型正则化方法，通过在损失函数中惩罚远离先前任务聚类中心的输出来缓解灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题阻碍了真正自适应人工智能的发展，需要防止深度学习模型在学习新任务时忘记旧任务

Method: 在损失函数中引入ICS正则化项，惩罚模型产生远离先前任务聚类中心的输出，并通过超参数调优找到最优权重

Result: 在5任务Split CIFAR-10基准测试和ResNet-18架构上，ICS在保持初始任务性能方面表现有效，但在长期知识保留方面存在局限性

Conclusion: ICS方法在缓解灾难性遗忘方面有效，但揭示了持续学习中的复杂性和权衡，为未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于流模型的分布强化学习方法（Value Flows），通过流匹配目标学习完整的未来回报分布，并使用流导数ODE估计回报不确定性，在37个状态基准和25个图像基准任务上平均成功率提升1.3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分布强化学习方法通常将回报分布简化为离散分类分布或有限分位数，无法捕捉回报分布的细粒度结构，也难以识别具有高回报不确定性的状态用于决策制定。

Method: 使用灵活的基于流模型来估计完整的未来回报分布，提出了新的流匹配目标来生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径，并基于学习的流模型使用新的流导数ODE来估计不同状态的回报不确定性。

Result: 在37个状态基准任务和25个图像基准任务上的实验表明，Value Flows方法相比先前方法平均成功率提升了1.3倍。

Conclusion: 基于流模型的分布强化学习方法能够更准确地估计回报分布和不确定性，在离线学习和在线到在线设置中均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Conclusion: FedQS为半异步联邦学习提供了一个统一的解决方案，实现了稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习，弥合了聚合策略之间的差距。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

TL;DR: GRFs++是一种改进的图随机特征方法，通过walk-stitching技术和更灵活的游走长度分布策略，解决了传统GRFs在建模远距离节点关系和采样效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图随机特征(GRFs)存在难以建模远距离节点关系、依赖采样长图随机游走效率低、游走终止机制过于简单等问题，需要更高效准确的计算图核方法。

Method: 提出walk-stitching技术，将多个短游走拼接而不破坏无偏性；扩展游走终止机制，采用更一般的游走长度分布策略；用并行计算短游走和矩阵乘法替代顺序采样长游走。

Result: GRFs++继承了长游走的近似质量但计算效率更高，在不增加计算成本的情况下提高了图核的近似精度，并通过实证评估验证了这些优势。

Conclusion: GRFs++通过创新的游走拼接技术和灵活的终止策略，有效解决了传统GRFs的局限性，为图核计算提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Result: 在OGBench复杂长时程任务中持续优于基线方法，并能显著提升大规模视觉-语言-动作模型的性能

Conclusion: DEAS框架通过动作序列和分离价值学习，有效解决了离线强化学习中的长时程决策问题

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高收集成本和日益增长的隐私担忧，获取大规模LBSN轨迹数据变得困难。合成数据生成提供了一种新机会，但现有方法难以处理LBSN签到轨迹的空间离散、时间不规则特性以及复杂时空模式。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用稀疏感知时空扩散模型从原始轨迹重建连续规则潜在移动序列；第二阶段使用Transformer-based Seq2Seq架构，通过动态上下文融合和多任务混合头解码器生成细粒度轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和实用性评估上均优于现有最先进模型，在FS-TKY数据集上距离和半径指标分别提升超过69%和55%。

Conclusion: GeoGen框架成功解决了LBSN签到轨迹生成的挑战，通过粗到细的方法有效建模了语义相关性和行为不确定性，为POI推荐、广告和疫情干预等应用提供了高质量合成数据。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归transformer在相同计算量下性能落后于非递归模型，主要存在两个瓶颈：未分化计算（每次迭代采用相似计算模式）和信息过载（长期和瞬时信息共存于单一隐藏状态）

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH)方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，使用轻量级路由器动态多样化各迭代的计算

Result: 在Pythia套件（160M-1.4B）上，MeSH增强的递归transformer持续优于递归基线，在1.4B规模上超越更大的非递归对应模型，平均下游准确率提升+1.06%，非嵌入参数量减少33%

Conclusion: MeSH是构建更强递归模型的可扩展且原则性的架构，通过可视化确认成功解决了病理问题，实现了迭代间的功能专门化

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Conclusion: Rényi锐度是一种有效的泛化能力度量指标，基于其设计的RSAM训练方法在提升模型泛化性能方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种层间自适应调制方案来减少无线联邦学习中的通信延迟，通过考虑不同DNN层的重要性来自动决定最优调制级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线联邦学习中客户端需要传输高维DNN参数，带宽受限导致通信延迟问题，现有方法对所有层使用相同调制级别存在优化空间。

Method: 层间自适应调制方案，根据DNN层的重要性自动决定各层的最优调制级别，而非对所有层使用统一调制。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比现有方案可节省高达73.9%的通信延迟。

Conclusion: 层间自适应调制方案能有效减少无线联邦学习的通信延迟，通过考虑层间重要性差异实现更优的通信效率。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一种基于弱形式方程学习和核密度估计的方法，从稀疏的昆虫位置数据中学习鳞翅目幼虫种群运动的有效模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解作物和林业害虫的扩散动态可以更好地预测爆发强度和位置，从而实现更好的害虫管理。昆虫在感染、捕食和各向异性环境条件下可能表现出优先运动模式。

Method: 扩展弱形式方程学习技术，结合核密度估计，从高度稀疏的实验数据中学习鳞翅目幼虫种群运动模型。使用弱形式稀疏非线性动力学识别(WSINDy)算法等Galerkin方法。

Result: 在模拟农业条件下，对秋粘虫(Spodoptera frugiperda)在不同植物资源和感染状态下的位置测量数据进行了方法验证。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从稀疏数据中有效学习昆虫种群运动的控制方程，为害虫管理提供预测工具。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Motivation: 科学文献中药代动力学信息提取和标准化存在挑战，限制了药物开发中数据驱动模型的可靠性。LLMs在生物医学结构化数据（如PK表格）中的适应受到异质性、噪声和领域偏移的限制

Method: HySim-LLM统一数学计算框架，整合嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪。建立两个理论结果：相似性加权泛化边界和流形去噪保证

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域提供了可靠且可解释的LLM适应的数学基础路径

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘技术在让LLMs遗忘敏感信息时，往往会损害模型的原有能力和知识，需要一种既能有效遗忘又能保持模型效用的方法。

Method: 采用两步框架，基于二阶优化器方法，但只选择性更新编码遗忘集的关键神经元，而不是全面更新模型参数。

Result: SIMU在实现可比较的遗忘效果的同时，在保持模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 选择性更新关键神经元的策略能够有效平衡遗忘效果与知识保留，为机器遗忘提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

TL;DR: MetaDefense是一个针对大型语言模型微调越狱攻击的防御框架，采用两阶段防御方法：预生成阶段检测有害查询，生成中阶段监控部分响应，通过专门提示训练模型预测查询和响应的有害性，实现早期终止有害交互。


<details>

Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到未见攻击模板伪装的有害查询，尽管LLMs在嵌入空间能够区分伪装的有害查询。

Method: 提出两阶段防御方法：预生成防御在响应生成前检测有害查询，生成中防御在生成过程中监控部分响应以防止输出更多有害内容。通过专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的有害性。

Result: 在多个LLM架构（LLaMA-2-7B、Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct、LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct）上的广泛实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对可见和未见攻击模板的有害查询实现鲁棒防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense框架通过两阶段防御方法有效防御微调越狱攻击，在多个LLM架构上表现出色，为LLM安全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时自改进方法，通过识别模型不确定样本、生成类似示例并进行测试时微调，显著提升模型性能，同时大幅减少训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型微调依赖大量训练数据，效率低下且成本高昂，无法保证模型在复杂场景下的泛化能力。现有技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息，导致不必要的成本。

Method: 提出三步骤算法：1) 识别模型不确定样本（自感知）；2) 从不确定样本生成类似示例（自数据增强）；3) 在测试时使用新生成样本进行微调（自改进）。研究了TT-SI（同模型自生成）和TT-D（强模型蒸馏）两种变体。

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的图级异常检测方法严重依赖大量标注数据，而现实场景中标注数据往往稀缺；同时少样本异常检测方法容易受噪声干扰，导致嵌入质量差和模型鲁棒性降低。

Conclusion: MA-GAD通过结合图压缩和元学习，有效解决了少样本图级异常检测中的噪声干扰和标注数据稀缺问题，在真实数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Motivation: SEM图像常受噪声污染，影响图像质量和后续分析，需要有效的信噪比估计和去噪方法。

Method: 比较了五种SNR估计技术，选择最优的LSR方法，结合SVM和GPR进行噪声方差估计，最终提出AO-GPRLLSR滤波管道。

Result: LSR方法表现最佳，Optimizable GPR模型在噪声方差估计中精度最高，提出的方法在SNR和NV估计方面表现优异，滤波后MSE更低。

Conclusion: AO-GPRLLSR方法能有效估计SEM图像的SNR和NV，并通过NV引导的Wiener滤波器显著提升图像质量。

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上评估，与基于GNN的SafeDrug模型相比，F1分数(p=0.0387)、Jaccard(p=0.0112)和DDI率(p=0.0386)均取得统计显著改进

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard是一个基于草图压缩的去中心化联邦学习框架，通过Count Sketch将高维模型压缩为低维草图进行相似性比较，显著降低了通信和计算开销，同时保持对拜占庭攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御方法需要每个客户端在每轮训练中与所有邻居交换和比较完整的高维模型向量，导致通信和计算成本过高，无法在web规模部署。

Method: 使用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩为k维草图（k<<d）进行相似性比较，然后仅从接受的邻居处选择性获取完整模型，将每轮通信复杂度从O(d|N_i|)降低到O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)。

Result: 在多个数据集、网络拓扑和攻击场景下的实验表明，SketchGuard保持与最先进方法相同的鲁棒性，同时将计算时间减少高达82%，通信开销减少50-70%，且收益随模型维度和网络连接性呈乘性增长。

Conclusion: 草图压缩作为基础使能技术，为在web规模实现鲁棒的去中心化联邦学习确立了可行性。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SNN与人工神经网络(ANN)存在性能差距，传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大教师模型或引入额外训练开销，需要更高效的SNN训练方法。

Method: 将SNN分解为多个时间步子模型，评估其输出置信度识别强弱关系，提出Strong2Weak和Weak2Strong两种自蒸馏方案，支持集成、同步和级联等灵活实现方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提高了SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用了SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

Motivation: 改进神经网络风险证书的实用性，通过更紧的边界和高效优化方法，使PAC-Bayes理论在实际应用中更加有效。

Method: 1) 推导伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界；2) 基于隐式微分的方法将PAC-Bayes风险证书优化整合到模型训练中；3) 优化非可微目标（如0-1损失）的边界。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上实现了最紧的显式边界，并在CIFAR-10上获得了首个非平凡泛化边界。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提高了PAC-Bayes风险证书的实用性和紧致性，为神经网络的可信性验证提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

*Alexander Rubinstein,Benjamin Raible,Martin Gubri,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型响应差异最大的样本来预测最终测试性能，避免了传统聚类方法的复杂性，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，降低了包容性、减缓创新速度并增加环境影响。传统方法依赖聚类选择锚点子集，但聚类过程复杂且对设计选择敏感。

Method: DISCO方法选择模型响应差异最大的前k个样本，使用贪心的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧提供了信息理论最优的选择规则。

Result: 在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中，DISCO在性能预测方面超越了先前方法，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: 促进样本多样性并不重要，关键是选择能最大化模型响应多样性的样本。DISCO方法概念更简单，理论更优，实证表现更好。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PRESCRIBE框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合估计模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信度评分提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要评估预测可靠性，考虑目标基因与训练数据的相似度（模型不确定性）和训练数据质量（数据不确定性），因为基因扰动是随机生化过程。

Method: 提出了PRESCRIBE（PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation），一个多变量深度证据回归框架，能够联合测量两种不确定性来源。

Result: PRESCRIBE能有效估计每个预测的置信度评分，该评分与经验准确性高度相关，相比基线方法实现了超过3%的稳定准确率提升。

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE通过联合估计模型和数据不确定性，能够过滤不可靠的预测结果，提高单细胞扰动预测的可靠性。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一个多智能体强化学习框架，集成高效的气候代理模型来替代计算昂贵的气候模拟器，实现多气体动态下的区域气候政策学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候政策研究需要能捕捉多种温室气体对全球温度综合影响的模型，但这些模型计算成本高，难以嵌入强化学习系统。

Method: 使用预训练的循环神经网络架构作为CICERO-SCM气候模型的代理模型，在多智能体强化学习环境中直接集成该高效代理模型。

Result: 代理模型达到接近模拟器的精度（温度RMSE≈0.0004K），推理速度提升约1000倍，端到端训练加速超过100倍，且与原始模拟器收敛到相同的最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法绕过了核心计算瓶颈而不牺牲策略保真度，使得在多气体动态和高保真气候响应下进行大规模多智能体气候政策实验成为可能。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

TL;DR: 该论文通过稳定性分析推导了多Gossip步骤(MGS)的泛化误差和超额误差上界，系统回答了MGS在去中心化训练中的有效性原因及其与中心化训练的性能差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化训练虽然通信效率高，但性能往往低于中心化训练。MGS作为连接去中心化和中心化训练的桥梁，能显著缩小实验性能差距，但其理论有效性和能否完全消除差距仍是未解问题。

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，在非凸设置下分析学习率、数据异构性、节点数量、每节点样本量和通信拓扑等因素对MGS泛化的影响。

Result: 1) MGS以指数速率减少优化误差界，从而指数收紧泛化误差界；2) 即使MGS趋于无穷，与中心化训练相比仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距；3) 在CIFAR数据集上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MGS能显著改善去中心化训练性能，但无法完全消除与中心化训练的性能差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

TL;DR: 本文首次揭示了现代LLM剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全漏洞，攻击者可以构建看似良性的模型，但在剪枝后表现出恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型剪枝的安全隐患，揭示现有剪枝方法在部署时可能被恶意利用的安全漏洞。

Method: 攻击者计算参数被剪枝概率的代理指标，将恶意行为注入到不太可能被剪枝的参数中，然后使用可能被剪枝的参数修复模型，从而在未剪枝模型中抵消恶意行为。

Result: 在五个模型上的广泛评估显示，经过vLLM中的任意剪枝方法处理后，模型在多种攻击场景中持续表现出强烈的恶意行为（越狱成功率高达95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，目标内容注入成功率99.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了关键部署时安全漏洞，强调了在模型压缩中加强安全意识的紧迫性。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中过拟合问题，特别是针对数据异常值、噪声和有限训练数据的情况。传统D2C方法的聚合策略未能充分利用子集模型的泛化能力差异。

Method: 在D2C方法基础上，引入动态不确定性感知聚合机制，基于子集模型在共享验证集上的准确率和预测不确定性进行动态加权，让中心模型优先学习泛化能力更强的子集模型。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上，DUA-D2C显著改善了泛化性能，即使在其他正则化方法基础上应用也能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一个理论上有依据且有效的深度学习方法，能有效对抗过拟合问题，在决策边界、损失曲线等指标上表现出色。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过扩展参数数量并继续训练来回收预训练检查点的方法，特别针对混合专家模型，使用正交增长策略，在相同额外计算预算下比从头训练获得10.66%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练的计算成本快速增长，许多已训练好的检查点由于工程限制或模型容量限制而未被充分利用，需要更高效地重用这些"沉没成本"。

Method: 提出正交增长方法：深度增长使用层间复制，宽度增长使用专家复制并注入噪声。通过全面的扩展实验确定检查点序列中的最佳增长时机。

Result: 将方法扩展到70B参数和超过1T训练token的模型，在相同额外计算预算下比从头训练获得10.66%的准确率提升，最终准确率与沉没成本量呈强正相关。

Conclusion: 检查点回收方法为经济高效的大型语言模型预训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

Conclusion: 后门向量框架为理解后门攻击提供了新视角，SBV展示了合并技术可增强攻击，而IBVS则为模型合并提供了有效的安全防护方案。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过扩大模型宽度（无需参数置换）配合适当的softmax温度校准，即可实现线性模式连接性（LMC），并提出了层间指数加权连接性（LEWC）来解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数置换搜索和足够宽的模型，但本文旨在证明仅通过扩大模型宽度配合温度校准就能实现LMC，揭示模型宽度对线性模式连接性的促进作用。

Method: 使用softmax温度校准技术，分析中间层输出，提出层间指数加权连接性（LEWC）概念，证明合并模型的每层输出可表示为原始模型对应层输出的指数加权和。

Result: 实验证明仅扩大模型宽度配合温度校准即可实现LMC，无需参数置换。LEWC分析显示合并模型输出等同于原始模型的集成，这促进了LMC的实现。

Conclusion: 模型宽度不仅促进非线性模式连接性，还能显著提高实现线性模式连接性的可能性，这是首次证明宽度对LMC的直接影响。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

TL;DR: 提出Subject-Conditioned Layer来解决EEG解码中的主体特定分布偏移问题，该层通过分解权重为共享组件和个性化低秩修正来适应不同主体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主体特定的分布偏移是EEG解码基础模型发展的重要障碍，需要解决主体间变异性问题。

Method: 设计自适应层作为标准线性或卷积层的替代，将权重分解为共享的主体不变组件和轻量级低秩修正，分离通用知识与个性化适应。

Result: 配备该层的模型在性能上优于仅使用共享权重的模型和单独训练的主体特定模型的平均值。

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨主体EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Conclusion: 通过量化专家数据的价值，该框架为智能体智能决定何时向他人学习提供了实用的信息理论算法。

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

TL;DR: 本文提出了近似领域遗忘(ADU)的新问题设置，旨在从预训练视觉语言模型中移除特定领域知识，同时保持其他领域的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近似遗忘方法主要关注类别遗忘，但在实际应用中仅遗忘对象类别往往不够。例如自动驾驶系统需要准确识别真实汽车，同时避免将路边广告中的插画汽车误认为真实汽车。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过显式解缠领域分布并自适应捕捉实例特定的领域信息来解决领域分布高度纠缠的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在基于VLM调优技术构建的基线方法上表现更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VLM中实用且细粒度的遗忘铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

TL;DR: 提出了AEPO方法解决强化学习微调中的熵崩溃问题，通过温度调节和REINFORCE策略梯度实现精确的熵控制，揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，即熵单调下降导致探索消失和策略过早收敛，现有熵正则化方法只能部分缓解该问题且引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出AEPO方法，用温度调整分布上的REINFORCE策略梯度替代熵奖励，通过温度调节稳定熵，包含三个关键设计：策略梯度作为正则化、分布作为正则化、REINFORCE作为正则化。

Result: AEPO能够在任意目标水平稳定熵，有效消除GRPO中的熵崩溃；揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系；提供了更广泛的RFT范式。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵崩溃问题，实现了精确的熵控制，阐明了熵、探索和推理性能之间的关系，为强化学习微调提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Motivation: 利用先进推理模型中出现的置信度校准特性，通过早期停止来提升大型语言模型在推理任务中的token效率。

Method: 使用token级logprobs的香农熵作为置信度信号，建立熵阈值实现早期停止推理，该阈值可通过少量推理数据集样本一次性计算得出。

Result: 在推理优化模型系列中实现25-50%计算成本降低，同时保持准确性，表明先进推理模型往往在早期就能意识到自己已获得正确答案。

Conclusion: 置信度机制是现代后训练推理系统区别于前代模型的关键特征，基于熵的早期停止框架能有效利用这一特性实现显著的计算效率提升。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

TL;DR: 提出GALA框架解决无监督多源域自适应(UMDA)的扩展性问题，通过组间差异最小化和温度控制加权策略，在保护隐私的同时实现大规模异构源域的高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式UMDA方法假设源域数量较少，在处理大量异构域时存在计算开销大、性能不稳定等问题，需要可扩展的解决方案。

Method: GALA框架包含：(1)组间差异最小化目标，无需二次计算即可近似全对域对齐；(2)温度控制质心加权策略，动态优先考虑与目标域对齐的源域。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到竞争性或最先进结果，在多样化多源设置中显著优于先前方法，特别是在其他方法无法收敛的情况下。

Conclusion: GALA为大规模异构源域的联邦UMDA提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，通过新提出的Digit-18基准验证了其在高多样性场景下的有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Conclusion: 该研究成功融合了自回归模型的稳定性与非自回归模型的上下文感知能力，为复杂序列生成提供了新的架构范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾识别在深度学习和基础模型微调中普遍存在且具有挑战性，偏斜的类别分布阻碍了模型对尾部类别的泛化能力。现有方法在广泛场景中难以取得一致改进。

Method: 提出模型再平衡框架MORE，引入低秩参数组件来调节参数空间分配，使用定制损失和正弦重加权调度，但不增加整体模型复杂度或推理成本。

Result: 在多样化的长尾基准测试中，MORE显著提高了泛化能力，特别是对尾部类别，并能有效补充现有的不平衡缓解方法。

Conclusion: MORE作为一个强大的即插即用模块，在长尾设置中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，D-SINK显著提高了鲁棒性，在长尾噪声数据学习中取得了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同利用专门处理单一问题的'弱'辅助模型，可以在不冲突的情况下整合它们的互补优势，有效解决类别不平衡和标签噪声的共现挑战。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖性的方法通常需要重新训练整个模型，这在原始数据或计算资源有限时不可行。

Method: 在预训练CBM基础上添加小型协方差预测模块，引入概念间的多元正态分布，提出两种训练策略。

Result: PSCBMs在真实数据上一致匹配或优于标准CBMs的概念和目标准确性，在干预下表现显著更好，同时比从头训练类似随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种轻量级方法，能够有效建模概念依赖关系，提升模型性能，特别是在干预场景下，且无需重新训练主干模型。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的顺序决策环境中，仅最大化期望收益是不够的，需要系统性地管理不确定性。

Method: UAMDP框架包含三个核心组件：贝叶斯动态模型更新、通过Thompson采样的未来情景采样、以及在条件风险价值约束下的策略优化。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制两个领域的测试显示，UAMDP显著改善了长期预测准确性（RMSE降低25%，sMAPE降低32%），交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准的概率建模、与后验不确定性对齐的探索以及风险感知控制，为顺序决策提供了稳健且可泛化的方法，实现更安全、更有利的决策结果。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

*Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Jaemoo Choi,Petr Molodyk,Bo Yuan,Molei Tao,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DMPO（Distribution Matching Policy Optimization），一种专门为扩散大语言模型设计的强化学习微调方法，通过分布匹配提升推理能力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）相比自回归大语言模型（AR-LLMs）具有更高的推理吞吐量，但需要专门的强化学习算法来达到可比性能，特别是在推理任务上。

Method: DMPO通过交叉熵优化将dLLM策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布进行匹配，解决了小批量训练的关键挑战，并提出了新颖的权重基线减法技术。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，DMPO无需监督微调即实现了显著性能提升，比之前SOTA基线准确率提高达42.9%，比基础模型提高55.8%。

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架在增强dLLMs推理能力方面非常有效，DMPO为dLLMs的强化学习微调提供了理论支撑的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

TL;DR: 使用政治罗盘测试评估8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现模型普遍存在左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性角色提示更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在信息传播和决策过程中日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 采用二维政治罗盘测试评估模型固有政治倾向，使用角色提示探索显性刻板印象，通过多语言版本PCT揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有研究模型都表现出一致的左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见存在一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于LLM的智能体是否能够通过交互影响对手的学习动态，提出了ShapeLLM方法，证明LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏中引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏中促进协调并提高集体福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实环境中的部署增加，多智能体交互不可避免，需要理解此类系统中的策略行为。核心问题是LLM智能体是否能像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互来塑造学习动态并影响其他智能体的行为。

Method: 提出了ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于transformer的智能体量身定制的无模型对手塑造方法的改编版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏（迭代囚徒困境、匹配便士和胆小鬼游戏）中成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏（迭代猎鹿游戏和合作版囚徒困境）中促进协调并提高集体福利。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过交互相互塑造，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Mix-和MoE-DPO框架，通过软混合模型和专家混合架构扩展DPO，使用随机变分推理方法学习专业化专家策略，在多任务设置中提供更好的表达能力和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务设置中的表达能力以及对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入基于专家分配的潜变量模型，优化变分证据下界，支持共享基础架构和独立专家模型，实现稳定高效的学习。

Result: 在多种模型大小和多偏好数据集上验证，证明Mix-和MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了强大且可扩展的方法。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO通过混合模型提供了通用函数逼近能力、专家策略专业化以及上下文对齐，显著优于标准DPO方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本文解决了高维多元结果的反事实识别问题，利用连续时间流方法建立了反事实识别的基础，确保因果推断的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实推断方法缺乏识别性，削弱了因果估计的有效性。Pearl认为反事实必须可识别才能证明因果主张。

Method: 使用连续时间流方法，包括非马尔可夫设置，通过动态最优传输工具构建唯一、单调且保秩的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证了理论，并在真实图像上展示了反事实公理合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 建立了多元反事实识别的理论基础，确保了因果推断的一致性和有效性。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将物理定律层次结构嵌入深度生成模型的分层框架，通过傅里叶神经算子和条件流匹配实现物理约束的时间序列生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性。

Method: 结合傅里叶神经算子学习物理算子，条件流匹配进行概率生成，通过时间依赖的分层约束和FNO引导的校正进行集成。

Result: 在谐振子、人类活动识别和锂离子电池退化实验中，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测精度提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架为物理信息归纳偏差引入了新范式，显著提升了生成质量和物理一致性。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI成为6G网络控制的核心组件，AI模型需要适应不断变化的环境条件，包括多供应商部署、硬件升级和服务需求演进带来的新特征和测量指标。

Method: 采用自适应随机森林(ARFs)进行迭代训练实现动态特征适应，并提出漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)方法，使用分布漂移检测器来决定何时应用计算密集型特征重要性方法。

Result: 在3个不同数据集上的测试表明，该方法可将运行时间减少多达2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值，ARFs的预测准确性随时间推移而提高。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI共同为6G网络用例提供了一个有前景的灵活AI方法框架，能够有效处理动态环境中的特征适应问题。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中对抗行为的挑战，现有方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么通信成本过高。

Method: 采用基于拉取的流行病通信策略，从小型随机节点子集拉取模型参数，无需中央服务器。

Result: 在对抗性环境下保持鲁棒性，通信成本显著降低，准确性与全连接通信相当，可扩展到大型网络。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的分布式鲁棒学习方法，在保证收敛性的同时大幅降低通信开销。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

TL;DR: 提出了Learning to Ask (LtA)框架，通过两阶段架构让AI系统不仅能决定何时求助人类专家，还能学习如何有效整合专家反馈，相比传统的Learning to Defer (LtD)方法更具灵活性和协作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Learning to Defer方法将人类和AI视为互斥决策者，限制了专家的贡献仅为预测结果。需要开发更有效的人机协作系统，让AI不仅能决定何时求助专家，还能学习如何整合专家输入。

Method: 基于两阶段架构：标准ML模型和增强模型（训练时加入专家反馈），并设计最优策略选择何时查询增强模型。提供两种实现：顺序训练方法和联合优化方法，后者设计了具有可实现一致性保证的代理损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA框架为人机协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础，能够更有效地整合专家输入。

Conclusion: LtA框架通过处理何时以及如何整合专家输入，为人机协作分类任务提供了更有效的决策支持系统，超越了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 研究transformer在需要棋盘游戏式推理的集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，理解模型在长序列上的表现限制机制。

Method: 理论分析单层注意力transformer的维度边界，通过平衡logit位移条件证明泛化性，提出dropout和EMA机制改善训练动态，并在集合补集任务和OthelloGPT上验证。

Result: 证明单层注意力transformer在特定条件下可泛化到更长序列但精度下降，发现softmax压缩logit位移是主要限制，验证dropout和EMA可有效改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化受softmax压缩效应限制，但通过dropout和EMA等机制可显著改善泛化能力，为复杂推理任务提供理论指导。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

Motivation: 传统指南或启发式方法在肠内营养治疗中存在局限性，需要更个性化、数据驱动的方法来改善重症患者预后。

Method: 使用双Q网络和保守Q学习正则化，在MIMIC-IV数据库的11,000多名ICU患者数据上进行离线训练，整合临床状态空间和定制奖励函数。

Result: DeepEN在各项指标上优于临床医生和指南策略，死亡率降低3.7个百分点（18.8% vs 22.5%），营养生物标志物改善。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的肠内营养个性化治疗有潜力超越传统方法，改善患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis
class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan
Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued
feedback. Through our results we show that the learnability of a set learning
problem is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension.

*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Yao Zhu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA是一种基于果蝇嗅觉电路启发的LoRA变体，通过隐式MoE设计消除显式路由器的需求，有效缓解参数干扰问题，在多个领域实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，导致性能不佳。虽然MoE-based LoRA变体在单任务中有所改善，但在多任务模型合并中仍然存在任务间干扰，且引入额外路由器参数。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在up-projection矩阵中引入rank-wise专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和down-projection，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统密集可训练版本。

Result: 在四个领域（通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理、代码生成）的广泛实验中，相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅展示了实证性能优势，还强调了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

*Lauren Anderson,Lucas Chatelain,Nicolas Tremblay,Kathryn Grandfield,David Rousseau,Aurélien Gourrier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究测试了多种深度学习超分辨率模型，用于提高牙齿孔隙结构成像的效率和质量，通过生物学驱动的评估方法揭示了标准图像质量评估指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙齿机械感觉系统依赖于牙本质孔隙网络中的流体流动，但当前共聚焦显微镜的高分辨率成像限制了视野范围。需要开发更高效的成像方法来扩大观察区域。

Method: 使用四种深度学习超分辨率模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN、CycleGAN），在实验配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像上进行训练和测试，像素尺寸增加2倍、4倍、8倍。

Result: 标准图像质量评估指标与视觉感知不一致，而基于孔隙网络结构和连通性的生物学驱动评估能更好地解释模型性能差异，揭示了模型对弱强度特征的敏感性和图像生成非线性的影响。

Conclusion: 针对特定生物结构（如牙齿孔隙）的超分辨率评估需要采用生物学驱动的分析方法，而非依赖通用的图像质量评估指标，这能提供更准确的性能解释。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过引入基于困惑度的正则化方法，为数据稀缺场景下的提示优化提供了非空泛的泛化界限，并分析了困惑度如何作为有效先验引导优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PAC-Bayes理论的泛化界限在数据丰富时有效，但在数据稀缺时变得空泛，无法解释实践中提示工程在少量数据下的成功。

Method: 提出基于困惑度的正则化方法，将困惑度作为有效先验，限制提示空间的探索范围，推导出适用于数据稀缺场景的非空泛泛化界限。

Result: 理论分析表明困惑度正则化能够收紧泛化界限，实证研究验证了该方法在提升提示泛化性能方面的实际效果。

Conclusion: 困惑度作为任务相关的先验信息，能够有效指导提示优化过程，为数据稀缺场景下的提示工程提供了理论解释和实践方法。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

### [278] [Reinforcing Diffusion Models by Direct Group Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08425)
*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO)，一种新的在线强化学习算法，直接基于组级偏好学习，无需低效的随机策略，可使用高效的确定性ODE采样器，训练速度比现有方法快约20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GRPO等强化学习方法显著提升了大型语言模型，但将其适应到扩散模型仍具挑战性。GRPO需要随机策略，而最具成本效益的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE。现有方法使用低效的SDE采样器引入随机性，但依赖模型无关的高斯噪声导致收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出DGPO算法，完全摒弃策略梯度框架，直接从组级偏好学习，利用组内样本的相对信息。这种设计消除了对低效随机策略的需求，能够使用高效的确定性ODE采样器和更快的训练。

Result: 广泛结果显示，DGPO训练速度比现有最先进方法快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: DGPO通过直接组偏好优化解决了扩散模型中强化学习的效率问题，实现了显著更快的训练速度和更好的性能表现。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，用于生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价，显著减少违规并提高风险表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约定价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程(RA-CMDP)，从法律和承保语料库中检索法定和政策条款，嵌入到智能体观察中，用于约束可行行动并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多代理条约模拟器中评估，ClauseLens减少偿付能力违规51%，尾部风险表现提高27.9%(CVaR_0.10)，基于条款的解释准确率达88.2%，检索精度87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可产生可解释、可审计且符合监管要求的报价行为，与Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案保持一致。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，使用强化学习训练智能路由器，在成本与性能之间做出最优权衡，无需人工设计路由规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：优质模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态路由规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一谱系，也无法跨任务类型自适应。

Method: 开发基于工具调用的路由系统xRouter，路由器经过端到端强化学习训练，使用显式的成本感知奖励函数来编码成本-性能权衡。实现完整的强化学习框架，包括奖励和成本核算，以及部署和评估流程。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（例如，在保持相似任务完成率的同时大幅降低成本），并提供了关于学习路由可靠帮助因素的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter的研究成果和开源实现为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，揭示了从小型开放模型中激发复杂编排行为的难度等关键发现。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Motivation: 解决时间序列分析基础模型面临的数据稀缺和不平衡问题，受复杂动态系统理论启发，开发高质量时间序列数据生成方法。

Method: 设计系列-符号数据生成机制，创建时间序列数据与符号表达式的配对，开发SymTime预训练模型利用符号信息增强时间序列表示。

Result: SymTime在下游任务微调后，在五大时间序列分析任务中表现出色，性能可与真实世界数据集预训练的基础模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 系列-符号数据生成和预训练机制在克服数据稀缺和提升任务性能方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理大感受野信息时存在过压缩问题，导致信息瓶颈，限制了模型的存储和检索能力。

Method: 通过分析现有过压缩测量任务的局限性，设计新的合成任务来验证信息瓶颈问题，并借鉴序列建模中的关联记忆、快速权重编程和xLSTM思想，开发了具有改进容量的新型GNN架构。

Result: 新架构在容量合成任务和多个真实世界图基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 从存储和检索容量角度理解过压缩问题，并提出有效解决方案，新架构在理论和实践中都取得了良好效果。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个九维积分签名的严格框架来分类激活函数，结合高斯传播统计、渐近斜率和正则性度量，建立了良定性、仿射重参数化定律和闭包性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多基于启发式方法，缺乏严格的理论框架来系统分类和分析激活函数的表达能力与稳定性。

Method: 使用九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)框架，包含高斯传播统计(m1,g1,g2,m2,eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus,alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'),C(phi))，进行动力学分析和核视角推导。

Result: 分类了八种标准激活函数(ReLU、leaky-ReLU、tanh、sigmoid、Swish、GELU、Mish、TeLU)，证明了饱和、线性增长和平滑族之间的明显区别，数值验证支持理论预测。

Conclusion: 该框架为激活函数选择提供了原则性设计指导，从试错方法转向可证明的稳定性和核条件化。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

TL;DR: 提出SummDiff方法，首次将扩散模型应用于视频摘要任务，将视频摘要重新定义为条件生成问题，能够生成多个反映不同人类视角的合理摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法确定性回归到多个标注者的平均帧分数，忽略了任务固有的主观性，无法反映不同人类对什么是好摘要的多样观点。

Method: 采用扩散模型，将视频摘要构建为条件生成任务，模型学习好摘要的分布，根据输入视频动态适应视觉上下文并生成多个候选摘要。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要与个体标注者偏好更接近，并通过背包问题分析提供了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: SummDiff不仅提升了性能，更重要的是能够捕捉视频摘要的主观性，生成更符合人类多样视角的摘要。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉输入之间的复杂关系。LLMs的注意力机制提供了更灵活的关系建模能力。

Method: 使用预训练LLMs的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，并通过Next Token Prediction (NTP)损失对数值和图像数据进行微调，支持文本条件图像聚类。

Result: LLMs在文本编码数值数据上表现出令人印象深刻的零样本聚类能力，注意力矩阵显示出明显的聚类模式，谱聚类使用注意力矩阵提供了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLMs在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Method: 提出UML：未配对多模态学习器，采用模态无关的训练范式，单一模型交替处理不同模态输入并共享参数，利用不同模态是共享底层现实投影的假设。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，未配对辅助数据能产生比单模态训练更具信息量的表征；实证表明使用文本、音频或图像等未配对辅助模态数据能持续提升下游单模态任务的性能。

Conclusion: UML证明了未配对多模态数据可以有效增强单模态表征学习，为利用丰富但未配对的跨模态数据提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

Conclusion: DYNAMIX通过强化学习方法成功解决了异构动态环境下的批量大小优化问题，无需显式系统建模，能与现有分布式训练框架无缝集成，具有良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法只关注期望回报，难以描述学习到的策略特征。需要一种能保证收敛到特定最优策略并保持策略多样性的方法。

Method: 使用熵正则化和温度解耦策略，在正则化温度趋近于零时实现可解释、保持多样性的最优策略。

Result: 该方法能保证收敛到特定最优策略，实现可解释、保持多样性的策略，并能估计相关回报分布。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为强化学习提供了可解释性和多样性保证，同时确保策略相关对象的收敛性。

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,

Motivation: RLVR使用简单的二元反馈来后训练大型语言模型，在实证上取得了显著成功，但其工作原理缺乏理论理解。

Method: 通过分析RLVR在完整响应和token级别的训练过程，引入梯度间隙概念来形式化从低奖励到高奖励区域的改进方向，并推导收敛条件和步长阈值。

Result: 证明了收敛取决于更新方向与梯度间隙的对齐，推导了基于梯度间隙大小的尖锐步长阈值，并预测了关键步长如何随响应长度和成功率缩放。

Conclusion: 理论解释了为什么长度归一化等实用启发式方法能提高稳定性，并说明固定学习率下成功率可能停滞在100%以下。通过受控老虎机模拟和LLM实验验证了这些预测。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Abstract: We propose ERA, a new paradigm that constrains the sampling entropy above
given thresholds by applying specially designed activations to the outputs of
models. Our approach demonstrates broad effectiveness across different domains:
1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for
Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning
agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as
SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing
ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a
computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as
a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing
simpler and more robust algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GDPO算法，通过半确定性蒙特卡洛方案降低ELBO估计器的方差，解决了扩散语言模型强化学习微调中的似然估计难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但难以进行RL微调，因为其似然难以计算。现有方法如diffu-GRPO存在严重偏差，而基于ELBO的方法则因计算成本过高而应用受限。

Method: 提出GDPO算法，通过分解ELBO方差来源，使用半确定性蒙特卡洛方案在关键维度上进行快速确定性积分近似，有效降低方差。

Result: GDPO在数学、推理和编程基准测试中一致优于预训练检查点，并在大多数任务上超越了当前最先进的diffu-GRPO基线方法。

Conclusion: GDPO为扩散语言模型的RL微调提供了一种高效且低方差的解决方案，证明了半确定性蒙特卡洛方案在ELBO估计中的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为Linearizer的架构，通过将线性算子夹在两个可逆神经网络之间，使得非线性函数在特定向量空间中表现为线性，从而将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络本质上是非线性的，但线性性是相对于向量空间对定义的。本文旨在寻找非标准向量空间，使传统非线性函数在其中表现为线性。

Method: 提出Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中A是线性算子，g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络。通过构造新的加法和缩放操作来定义向量空间。

Result: 该框架使SVD、伪逆、正交投影等线性代数工具适用于非线性映射。两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍然是Linearizer，可将扩散模型的数百个采样步骤压缩为单步。

Conclusion: Linearizer架构成功地将线性代数工具扩展到非线性领域，在扩散模型、投影生成模型和风格迁移等应用中展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.
