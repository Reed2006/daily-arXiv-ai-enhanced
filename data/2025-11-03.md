Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了SSM与注意力机制的混合模型架构设计，发现顺序混合在短上下文表现更好，并行混合在长上下文更有效，并提出通过数据增强训练进一步提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模型结合了状态空间模型(SSM)的高效性和注意力机制的高召回能力，但其架构设计选择尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 分析顺序与并行混合架构的内存利用和性能表现，并引入基于释义数据增强的持续训练方法。

Result: 顺序混合在短上下文表现更好，并行混合在长上下文更有效；数据增强训练能进一步提升召回能力且保持其他能力。

Conclusion: 研究为混合SSM-注意力模型提供了深入理解，并为针对不同用例设计架构提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention
mechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs
and the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design
choices behind these hybrid models remain insufficiently understood. In this
work, we analyze hybrid architectures through the lens of memory utilization
and overall performance, and propose a complementary method to further enhance
their effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and
parallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several
interesting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on
shorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer
contexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on
datasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while
preserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models
and outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our
findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and
offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use
cases. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention
models and offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to
various use cases.

### [2] [Frame Semantic Patterns for Identifying Underreporting of Notifiable Events in Healthcare: The Case of Gender-Based Violence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26969)
*Lívia Dutra,Arthur Lorenzi,Laís Berno,Franciany Campos,Karoline Biscardi,Kenneth Brown,Marcelo Viridiano,Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Olívia Guaranha,Erik Santos,Sofia Reinach,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义框架识别医疗记录中应报告事件的方法，应用于性别暴力事件检测，在2100万句巴西葡萄牙语医疗记录中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗记录中性别暴力事件漏报问题，通过自动化方法提高公共卫生监测效率。

Method: 使用语义框架定义细粒度模式，在非结构化医疗文本中搜索匹配，构建透明、高效、语言无关的处理流程。

Result: 定义了8个模式，在2100万句语料中检测暴力报告，经人工评估精确度达0.726。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别暴力事件报告，可轻松适配其他健康监测场景，促进NLP在公共卫生系统中的伦理和可解释应用。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

TL;DR: MEDIQA-OE 2025是首个从医患对话中提取医疗指令的共享任务，旨在减轻临床医生的文档负担并改善患者护理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然临床文档越来越多地使用自动语音识别和摘要技术，但将对话转换为电子健康记录中的可操作医疗指令仍未被探索。解决这个问题可以显著减轻临床医生的文档负担并直接影响下游患者护理。

Method: 引入了MEDIQA-OE 2025共享任务，六个团队参与并尝试了广泛的方法，包括闭源和开源的大型语言模型。

Result: 共享任务成功举办，参与者探索了多种方法，论文描述了任务、数据集、最终排行榜排名和参与者的解决方案。

Conclusion: MEDIQA-OE 2025是医疗指令提取领域的首个挑战，为减轻临床文档负担提供了重要探索方向。

Abstract: Clinical documentation increasingly uses automatic speech recognition and
summarization, yet converting conversations into actionable medical orders for
Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can
significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact
downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first
challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six
teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of
approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In
this paper, we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking,
and participants' solutions.

### [4] [Semantically-Aware LLM Agent to Enhance Privacy in Conversational AI Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27016)
*Jayden Serenari,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LOPSIDED框架，通过语义感知的伪名化方法保护用户与大型语言模型对话中的敏感个人信息，同时保持对话的上下文完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话AI系统的广泛使用，用户在与大型语言模型交互时分享的敏感个人数据存在隐私泄露风险，可能导致安全漏洞或身份盗窃。

Method: 开发了LOPSIDED框架，动态地将用户提示中的敏感PII实体替换为语义一致的伪名，在模型生成响应后自动进行反伪名化处理。

Result: 在基于ShareGPT真实对话的评估中，LOPSIDED相比基线技术将语义效用错误减少了5倍，同时增强了隐私保护。

Conclusion: LOPSIDED框架有效平衡了隐私保护和语义完整性，为使用远程LLMs时的敏感数据保护提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

### [5] [Kad: A Framework for Proxy-based Test-time Alignment with Knapsack Approximation Deferral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27017)
*Ayoub Hammal,Pierre Zweigenbaum,Caio Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理的测试时对齐方法，使用小型对齐模型指导大语言模型，通过令牌级级联方法解决对齐成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然预训练阶段已具备大部分生成能力，但仍需对齐来满足下游任务需求，而随着模型规模扩大，对齐过程的计算成本急剧增加

Method: 采用令牌特定级联方法，将令牌级延迟决策简化为0-1背包问题，推导出最优延迟决策的原始和对偶近似解

Result: 实验证明该方法在任务性能和推测解码速度方面都有显著优势

Conclusion: 代理测试时对齐方法能够有效降低大语言模型对齐的计算成本，同时保持或提升模型性能

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

### [6] [Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27037)
*Shang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELM是一种新颖的神经架构搜索方法，通过引入灵活的搜索空间和动态模块来优化紧凑语言模型，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型的计算和内存需求引发了经济和环境担忧，需要开发更高效的紧凑模型。

Method: 扩展现有NAS方法，引入包含高效transformer块和动态维度/头数调整模块的灵活搜索空间，以及保留各块特性的新型知识蒸馏损失。

Result: 在掩码语言建模和因果语言建模任务上的实验表明，ELM发现的模型显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ELM通过创新的搜索空间设计和知识蒸馏策略，成功开发出高效且性能优越的紧凑语言模型。

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

### [7] [Dataset Creation and Baseline Models for Sexism Detection in Hausa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27038)
*Fatima Adam Muhammad,Shamsuddeen Muhammad Hassan,Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究构建了首个豪萨语性别歧视检测数据集，通过社区参与和用户研究探索文化差异，并评估了传统机器学习与多语言模型在豪萨语性别歧视检测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台助长了各种形式的性别歧视，但现有研究主要集中在高资源语言，低资源语言如豪萨语因语言资源有限和文化差异而进展缓慢。

Method: 通过社区参与、定性编码和数据增强构建豪萨语性别歧视数据集；进行两阶段用户研究(n=66)探索文化差异；实验传统机器学习分类器和预训练多语言模型，评估少样本学习效果。

Result: 研究发现在捕捉文化细微差别方面存在挑战，特别是澄清性询问和习语表达，这些情况下容易出现许多误报。

Conclusion: 豪萨语性别歧视检测面临文化差异带来的挑战，需要更细致的方法来处理澄清性询问和习语表达等特殊情况。

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

### [9] [Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049)
*Ponrawee Prasertsom,Andrea Silvi,Jennifer Culbertson,Moa Johansson,Devdatt Dubhashi,Kenny Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出基于最小描述长度(MDL)的方法来衡量数字系统的规律性和处理复杂度，认为递归数字系统在这两方面更高效，能更好地区分自然系统与非自然系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为递归数字系统在词汇量和形态句法复杂度之间达到最优平衡，但需要依赖临时约束来排除非自然系统。本文认为问题在于忽视了规律性这一关键因素。

Method: 采用最小描述长度(MDL)方法，提出衡量规律性和处理复杂度的新指标，分析递归数字系统的效率。

Result: 基于MDL的规律性和处理复杂度指标能更好地区分自然系统与非自然系统，包括先前研究中的"最优"递归数字系统，且先前文献中的临时约束自然地从规律性中得出。

Conclusion: 在语言最优性研究中需要纳入形式集合的规律性考量，MDL方法为此提供了更合适的框架。

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

### [10] [VISTA Score: Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27052)
*Ashley Lewis,Andrew Perrault,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VISTA是一个用于评估对话系统事实性的框架，通过声明级验证和序列一致性跟踪来检测多轮对话中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性评估指标要么评估孤立回复，要么将不可验证内容视为错误，限制了其在多轮对话中的应用。幻觉问题仍然是部署对话AI系统的主要障碍。

Method: VISTA将每个助手回复分解为原子事实声明，根据可信来源和对话历史进行验证，并将不可验证语句分类为主观、矛盾、缺乏证据或弃权。

Result: 在八个大型语言模型和四个对话事实性基准测试中，VISTA在幻觉检测方面显著优于FACTSCORE和LLM-as-Judge基线方法。人工评估证实VISTA的分解方法提高了标注者一致性。

Conclusion: 通过将事实性建模为对话的动态属性，VISTA为对话系统提供了一个更透明、更符合人类认知的真实性衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

### [11] [LLM-Centric RAG with Multi-Granular Indexing and Confidence Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27054)
*Xiaofan Guo,Yaxuan Luan,Yue Kang,Xiangchen Song,Jinxu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度记忆索引和不确定性估计的置信度控制方法，用于提升复杂知识环境下检索增强生成的覆盖度、稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂知识环境下检索增强生成存在的覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题。

Method: 构建分层记忆结构，将知识表示划分为不同粒度级别，实现从局部细节到全局上下文的动态索引检索；引入不确定性估计机制，在生成过程中显式约束和过滤低置信度路径；优化目标包括生成损失、熵约束和方差正则化。

Result: 在QA准确性、检索召回率、排序质量和事实一致性方面优于现有模型，验证了该方法在不同场景下的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多粒度索引与置信度控制的结合为检索增强生成提供了新的技术路径，并为提升大模型在复杂环境下的可靠性和可控性提供了实践证据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

*Michał Zawalski,Meriem Boubdir,Klaudia Bałazy,Besmira Nushi,Pablo Ribalta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CoDeC方法，通过上下文学习对模型性能的影响来检测和量化大语言模型中的训练数据污染，能区分记忆数据和未见数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要检测大语言模型训练数据污染问题，特别是对于未公开训练语料的开源模型，传统方法难以准确识别记忆数据。

Method: 通过测量上下文学习对模型置信度的影响：上下文示例通常会提升未见数据集的置信度，但可能降低训练数据集的置信度，因为会破坏记忆模式。

Result: CoDeC产生可解释的污染分数，能清晰区分见过和未见的数据集，并在未公开训练语料的开源模型中发现了强记忆证据。

Conclusion: CoDeC是一种简单、自动化、模型和数据集无关的方法，易于集成到基准评估中，能有效检测训练数据污染。

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比蒸馏和噪声鲁棒训练的微调方法，通过冻结骨干模型并转移教师模型的知识边界，提升语言模型的安全对齐和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在安全对齐和鲁棒性方面的局限性，构建更安全可信的对齐机制。

Method: 冻结骨干模型，通过蒸馏损失、鲁棒性损失和正则化项的统一优化目标，结合对比蒸馏和噪声鲁棒训练，在训练中引入噪声扰动和鲁棒优化约束。

Result: 在知识转移、鲁棒性和整体安全性方面显著优于现有基线方法，在多个关键指标上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 不仅丰富了参数高效微调的理论体系，还为构建更安全可信的对齐机制提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

*Adel Khorramrouz,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM安全护栏存在选择性拒绝偏见，对不同人口群体表现出不同的拒绝率，可能导致新的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM安全护栏在防止有害内容生成时可能引入的选择性拒绝偏见问题，即模型可能对某些人口群体拒绝生成有害内容而对其他群体不拒绝。

Method: 通过分析针对个体和交叉人口群体的拒绝率、LLM响应类型和拒绝生成长度来评估选择性拒绝偏见，并研究通过间接攻击目标先前被拒绝群体的安全影响。

Result: 发现LLM安全护栏在性别、性取向、国籍和宗教属性上存在选择性拒绝偏见证据，间接攻击方法揭示了额外的安全隐患。

Conclusion: 强调需要在不同人口群体间实现更公平和稳健的安全护栏性能，以解决选择性拒绝偏见带来的安全风险。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

*Rajarshi Haldar,Julia Hockenmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现使用大型语言模型作为自然语言生成评估工具存在评分不一致性问题，不同运行中LLM给出的分数可靠性较低，导致评估结果几乎随机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成技术广泛应用，其评估变得困难。虽然LLM评估比传统n-gram或基于嵌入的指标更符合人类偏好，但其评分一致性存在问题。

Method: 通过实验量化LLM评估在不同NLG任务和基准测试中的不一致性，并探索在遵循适当指南的情况下如何有效使用LLM评估。

Result: 实验显示LLM评估者在不同运行中具有较低的内部评分者可靠性，其评分存在显著方差，在最坏情况下几乎随机，难以衡量其判断质量。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM评估存在不一致性问题，但通过谨慎使用和遵循适当指南，仍可在自然语言生成评估中发挥一定作用。

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transformer语言模型在自回归和概率生成模式下的表达能力，揭示了与仅作为语言识别器使用时不同的表达能力特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数Transformer表达能力研究都将其视为语言识别器（接受或拒绝字符串），但实际应用中Transformer主要作为语言模型使用（自回归概率生成字符串）。需要研究Transformer在语言模型使用场景下的表达能力。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究Transformer语言模型能够表达的概率分布特性，比较自回归和非自回归模式下的表达能力差异。

Result: 研究发现：1）使Transformer语言识别器自回归化有时能提高其表达能力；2）概率化会打破非概率情况下的等价关系；3）揭示了Transformer在语言模型使用场景下的表达能力边界。

Conclusion: Transformer在作为语言模型使用时具有独特的表达能力特性，自回归和概率化会改变其表达能力表现，这为理解Transformer在实际应用中的能力提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

*Mason Shipton,York Hay Ng,Aditya Khan,Phuong Hanh Hoang,Xiang Lu,A. Seza Doğruöz,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了URIEL+语言知识库，通过添加脚本向量、整合Glottolog语言数据以及扩展谱系插补，显著减少了数据稀疏性问题，提升了多语言研究的覆盖范围和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URIEL+语言知识库存在数据稀疏问题，包括缺失特征类型、不完整的语言条目和有限的谱系覆盖，这限制了其在跨语言迁移特别是低资源语言支持方面的实用性。

Method: 引入脚本向量表示7,488种语言的书写系统属性；整合Glottolog添加18,710种额外语言；扩展谱系插补，为26,449种语言传播类型学和脚本特征。

Result: 脚本向量特征稀疏性减少14%；语言覆盖增加高达19,015种语言（增长1,007%）；插补质量指标提升高达33%；跨语言迁移任务中某些设置下性能提升达6%。

Conclusion: 这些扩展使URIEL+在多语言研究中更加完整和包容，为低资源语言提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

TL;DR: 提出了MemeArena评估框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型对有害多模态内容的理解能力，通过模拟多样化解释情境和达成共识机制来减少评估偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注二元分类任务的检测准确率，无法反映多模态有害性在不同情境下的深度解释细微差别。

Method: 基于代理的竞技场式评估框架，模拟多样化解释情境，整合不同观点并通过评估者达成共识来进行公平比较。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效减少了评估偏见，判断结果与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: MemeArena为多模态有害性理解提供了可靠且全面的mLLM评估方法，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS)的新方法，用于检测自然语言中信息密度的周期性模式，发现人类语言中存在显著的周期性信息模式，并识别出超出典型文本结构单元分布的新周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自然语言在编码信息中表现出的周期性模式程度，这是信息密度理论发展带来的新问题。

Method: 采用APS方法，这是一种规范周期性检测算法，能够识别单个文档惊奇值序列中存在的任何显著周期。

Result: 发现相当比例的人类语言在信息上表现出强烈的周期性模式；识别并确认了超出典型文本结构单元分布的新周期；通过谐波回归模型进一步验证了这些发现。

Conclusion: 语言中信息的周期性是结构化因素和长距离作用的其他驱动因素共同作用的结果；该方法在LLM生成检测方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

TL;DR: 提出了BEAM基准测试和LIGHT框架，用于评估和改进LLM在长对话中的记忆能力。BEAM包含100个长对话和2000个验证问题，LIGHT为LLM配备三种记忆系统来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏叙事连贯性、领域狭窄且只测试简单回忆任务，无法充分评估LLM在长对话中的记忆能力。

Method: 1) 自动生成长达1000万token的连贯对话并构建BEAM基准；2) 提出LIGHT框架，为LLM配备长期情景记忆、短期工作记忆和事实积累便签三种记忆系统。

Result: 实验显示，即使具有100万token上下文窗口的LLM在长对话中表现不佳，而LIGHT框架平均提升性能3.5%-12.69%，消融研究证实了各记忆组件的贡献。

Conclusion: BEAM基准有效评估LLM的长对话记忆能力，LIGHT框架通过模拟人类认知的多记忆系统显著提升LLM在长上下文推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

*Rajan Agarwal,Aarush Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLINK是一种计算高效的语言注入方法，通过将多语言编码器的句子嵌入对齐到解码器的潜在空间，改善低资源非拉丁语系语言在指令调优LLM中的表现，无需更改分词器或重新训练解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的大语言模型在低资源非拉丁语系脚本上表现不佳，主要由于分词器碎片化和弱跨语言耦合问题。

Method: 首先将冻结多语言编码器的句子嵌入通过轻量级对比投影器对齐到解码器潜在嵌入空间；然后将向量扩展为K个软槽，通过最小适配器训练使冻结解码器能够消费该信号。

Result: LLINK显著改善双语检索性能，在LLM评判的Q&A评估中获得81.3%优于基础模型和63.6%优于直接微调的偏好度。

Conclusion: 将低资源语言视为模态为轻量级LLM中实现更强跨语言对齐提供了实用路径，尽管模型在数值保真度方面仍存在残余弱点。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注问答和描述性推理，忽略了临床决策中至关重要的定量推理能力，现有数据集覆盖的计算任务有限且不能反映真实世界的计算场景。

Method: 创建包含方程型和规则型评分系统的医疗计算基准测试，并基于InternBootcamp框架开发强化学习环境MedCalc-Env，对Qwen2.5-32B模型进行微调。

Result: 在MedCalc-Eval上取得了最先进的结果，在数值敏感性、公式选择和推理鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了进展，但在单位转换、多条件逻辑和上下文理解方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and
contextual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现良好，但在高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在多语言推理差距。虽然最近努力减少了这一差距，但其根本原因仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过实验发现理解失败是主要原因，评估多种检测方法，提出选择性翻译策略：仅在检测到理解失败时将多语言输入翻译成英语。

Result: 选择性翻译能够显著缩小多语言推理差距，在仅翻译约20%输入的情况下，达到接近全翻译的性能表现。

Conclusion: 理解失败是多语言推理差距的主要原因，可以通过检测和选择性缓解来改善，为实现更公平的多语言推理提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型使用统一的Valence-Assent Axis（VAA）维度来计算评判性判断，该轴同时编码主观价值判断和事实认同，导致推理过程从公正推断转向目标导向的合理化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索智能系统是依赖专门模块还是统一通用资源进行判断，检验LLM中可解码的神经表征是否真正独立。

Method: 通过分析多种LLM，识别主导维度VAA，并进行直接干预实验验证其功能。

Result: 发现VAA作为控制信号引导生成过程构建与其评判状态一致的理据，即使牺牲事实准确性，导致推理从属化现象。

Conclusion: 该统一架构虽然促进连贯判断，但系统性地削弱忠实推理，为系统性偏见和幻觉提供了机制解释。

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的词对齐方法主要依赖mBERT或LaBSE等编码器语言模型，而机器翻译模型与词对齐之间存在明显关联但研究有限，特别是利用编码器-解码器架构的交叉注意力方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出TransAlign词对齐器，利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器来提取词对齐信息，用于跨语言迁移中的标签投影任务。

Result: TransAlign不仅实现了强大的词对齐性能，而且在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移中显著优于流行的词对齐方法和最先进的非词对齐标签投影方法。

Conclusion: TransAlign通过利用机器翻译模型的编码器，为跨语言迁移中的词对齐和标签投影任务提供了有效的解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要操纵隐藏表示来引导LLM生成，而本文旨在利用这些表示作为判别信号来指导树结构响应空间的探索。

Method: 在节点扩展时使用分类器作为评分和排序机制，优先扩展高分候选；完成树扩展后收集所有分支答案形成候选池；提出分支聚合方法，通过聚合CoT分数在所有支持分支上进行边际化，从而确定最优答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架的全面探索不仅覆盖了有效推理链，还能有效识别它们，在多个算术推理基准上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe框架通过利用LLMs的隐藏推理特征，在推理时实现了对响应空间的全面探索和有效识别，显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive systematic survey of the application of natural

framework for the EU's proposed digital battery passport (DBP) and other
general battery predictions. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method and employ three reputable
databases or search engines, including Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers Xplore (IEEE Xplore), and Scopus. Consequently, we
assessed 274 scientific papers before the critical review of the final 66
relevant papers. We publicly provide artifacts of the review for validation and
reproducibility. The findings show that new NLP tasks are emerging in the
battery domain, which facilitate materials discovery and other stages of the
life cycle. Notwithstanding, challenges remain, such as the lack of standard
benchmarks. Our proposed TLP framework, which incorporates agentic AI and
optimized prompts, will be apt for tackling some of the challenges.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注MLP模块，忽略了注意力模块在知识存储中的作用，导致残留过时知识和编辑效果受限。研究发现注意力模块在事实知识存储中发挥重要作用。

Method: 提出IntAttn-Edit方法，将关联记忆范式扩展到联合更新MLP和注意力模块，采用知识平衡策略根据各模块对知识存储的贡献比例分配更新幅度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，IntAttn-Edit相比先前方法实现了更高的编辑成功率、更好的泛化能力和更强的知识保留能力。平衡策略使编辑性能在不同设置下保持在最优范围内。

Conclusion: 注意力模块在知识存储中具有重要作用，联合更新MLP和注意力模块的知识编辑方法能显著提升编辑效果，知识平衡策略是确保编辑性能稳定的关键。

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer

different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for
neural network structures with better translation results, we considered
perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to
BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the
population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show
that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the
baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric
can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation
metric.

TL;DR: 提出基于贝叶斯启发和记忆熵概念的记忆管理系统，解决AI智能体在个性化服务中的记忆冗余、陈旧和上下文整合问题，通过最小化全局熵实现动态记忆更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI智能体系统依赖外部记忆数据库提供个性化体验，但面临记忆冗余、记忆陈旧和记忆-上下文整合差的问题，主要原因是交互过程中缺乏有效的记忆更新机制。

Method: 采用贝叶斯启发的记忆更新算法，引入记忆熵概念，使智能体能够通过最小化全局熵来自主维护动态更新的记忆向量数据库。

Result: 在情感表达和情感变化评估基准DABench上的实验表明，该系统在个性化、逻辑一致性和准确性方面表现优异，消融研究验证了贝叶斯启发更新机制在缓解记忆膨胀方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为长期记忆系统设计提供了新的见解，通过动态记忆管理提升了AI智能体的个性化服务能力。

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

### [32] [Detecting Prefix Bias in LLM-based Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13487)
*Ashwin Kumar,Yuzi He,Aram H. Markosyan,Bobbie Chern,Imanol Arrieta-Ibarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中奖励模型的偏见问题，特别关注前缀偏见——即查询前缀的微小变化会系统性改变模型偏好的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然公开可用的偏好数据集提供了响应对的比较，但由此训练出的奖励模型可能存在偏见，这一问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了检测和评估前缀偏见的新方法，使用这些指标揭示了种族和性别维度的显著偏见，并提出了数据增强策略来减轻这些偏见。

Result: 在多种开源偏好数据集和奖励模型架构上的综合评估显示，无论底层模型架构如何，都存在这种偏见敏感性。数据增强策略有效减少了前缀偏见的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发公平可靠的奖励模型时，需要采用偏见感知的数据集设计和评估方法，为AI公平性的广泛讨论做出贡献。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

*Xuan Gong,Senmiao Wang,Hanbo Huang,Ruoyu Sun,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VCORE是一种基于方差控制的优化重加权方法，通过将链式思维监督重新表述为约束优化问题，实现对推理轨迹中不同令牌的差异化监督分配，提升大语言模型的推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失对所有令牌一视同仁，忽略了推理轨迹中不同令牌的异质贡献，导致监督错配和弱泛化问题，特别是在复杂的长形式推理任务中。

Method: VCORE采用优化理论视角，将链式思维监督重新表述为约束优化问题，通过方差控制实现原则性和自适应的令牌监督分配。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，VCORE在领域内和领域外设置下均显著优于现有令牌重加权方法，使用Qwen3系列和LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct模型实现了实质性性能提升。

Conclusion: VCORE不仅提升了推理性能，还为后续强化学习提供了更有效的初始化，为增强大语言模型的推理能力奠定了更强基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的协作推理框架，利用扩散语言模型生成候选思考，大语言模型评估质量，在复杂推理任务中实现了强大性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的自回归生成范式导致推理性能随测试时间计算呈次优扩展，需要过多计算开销。扩散语言模型可以通过单次前向传播并行去噪高效生成多样化样本。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成候选中间思考，然后由大语言模型评估这些思考的质量，形成协作推理框架。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，该框架在复杂推理任务中实现了强大性能，同时减轻了自回归生成的计算负担。

Conclusion: 该协作推理框架为未来研究提供了有前景的方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究计算嵌入与人类语义判断在处理英语复合词时的一致性，推动计算心理语言学发展。

Method: 使用静态词向量(GloVe)和上下文嵌入(BERT)，与人类对词素意义主导性和语义透明度的评分进行比较，通过关联强度、频率和可预测性指标计算嵌入衍生的度量，并用Spearman相关和回归分析评估与人类判断的关系。

Result: BERT嵌入比GloVe更好地捕捉组合语义，可预测性评分在人类和模型数据中都是语义透明度的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究明确了驱动复合词处理的因素，为基于嵌入的语义建模提供了见解，推进了计算心理语言学的发展。

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

TL;DR: 该研究在低资源自然语言任务中比较了两种因果域泛化方法：因果数据增强和不变因果表示学习，发现两者都能提升对未见域的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中训练和测试数据分布往往不同，特别是在低资源环境下，数据稀缺和领域多样性有限会阻碍模型的鲁棒泛化能力。

Method: 1. 因果数据增强(CDA)：自动生成反事实样本来改善对伪相关的鲁棒性；2. 不变因果表示学习(ICRL)：使用DINER框架学习跨域不变表示，并扩展到多语言设置。

Result: 两种方法都增强了未见域的鲁棒性：反事实数据增强在情感分类中带来一致的跨域准确率提升；因果表示学习在多语言情感分析中改善了分布外性能，但不同语言的增益程度不同。

Conclusion: 因果域泛化方法在低资源自然语言任务中有效，能提升模型对分布变化的鲁棒性，但效果在不同语言和任务中有所差异。

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BiSparse-AAS框架，结合稀疏注意力、自适应跨度与双线性注意力，解决Transformer在长文档摘要中的二次复杂度问题，在多个数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在文本摘要中表现优异，但其二次计算复杂度限制了在长文档上的可扩展性，需要更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 结合稀疏注意力降低计算成本，自适应跨度动态调整注意力范围，双线性注意力在精炼上下文中建模复杂token交互。

Result: 在CNN/DailyMail和XSum数据集上分别实现约68.1%和52.6%的平均ROUGE提升，在OpenWebText和Gigaword数据集上保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS通过解决效率、可扩展性和长序列建模问题，为现实世界文本摘要应用提供了统一的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

TL;DR: SQLSpace是一种人类可解释、可泛化、紧凑的文本到SQL示例表示方法，能够支持基准测试比较、细粒度性能分析和查询重写优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够以最小人工干预从文本到SQL示例中提取的表示方法，用于更好地理解和评估文本到SQL系统的性能。

Method: 引入SQLSpace表示方法，通过三个用例展示其效用：基准测试组成比较、细粒度性能分析和基于正确性估计的查询重写。

Result: SQLSpace能够揭示基准测试之间的组成差异，暴露仅靠准确率无法发现的性能模式，并支持查询成功建模。

Conclusion: SQLSpace为文本到SQL任务提供了比原始示例更强大的分析能力，支持更深入的系统评估和性能改进。

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了以患者为中心的临床摘要(PCS)新标准，通过混合方法开发框架，评估开源大语言模型在生成包含患者价值观的临床摘要方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的临床摘要过于关注患者生物学信息，而忽略了患者的偏好、价值观、愿望和关切，无法实现以患者为中心的护理。

Method: 采用混合方法：通过患者和临床医生的半结构化访谈确定摘要内容标准，制定标注指南，由临床医生创建黄金标准PCS，然后使用五个开源LLM通过零样本和少样本提示生成摘要，并使用ROUGE-L、BERTScore和定性指标进行评估。

Result: 患者强调生活方式、社会支持、近期压力源和护理价值观，临床医生需要简洁的功能、心理社会和环境背景信息。Mistral-8B和Llama-3.1-8B在零样本表现最佳，Llama-3.1-8B在少样本表现最佳。模型在完整性和流畅性方面与专家相当，但在正确性和以患者为中心方面人类PCS更优。

Conclusion: 开源LLM在生成以患者为中心的临床摘要方面显示出潜力，但在正确性和患者中心性方面仍需改进，需要进一步研究来优化模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

TL;DR: 提出了DialectalArabicMMLU基准，用于评估大语言模型在阿拉伯语方言上的表现，填补了方言评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯语和多语言基准主要针对现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，而方言在日常交流中广泛使用却缺乏评估资源。

Method: 基于MMLU-Redux框架，手动翻译和改编了3K个选择题到五种主要阿拉伯语方言，共产生15K个QA对，涵盖32个学术和专业领域。

Result: 评估了19个阿拉伯语和多语言LLM，发现不同方言间存在显著的性能差异，揭示了方言泛化能力的持续差距。

Conclusion: 该基准为衡量阿拉伯语方言理解提供了首个统一的人工策划资源，促进了更包容的评估和未来模型发展。

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在荷兰语、罗马尼亚语和西班牙语等低资源语言中，通过领域特定语料库进一步预训练对医疗NLP任务性能的影响。结果表明领域适应显著提升了任务性能，临床领域适应的模型表现优于一般生物医学领域适应的模型，并观察到跨语言可转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗应用中，特别是低资源语言领域，缺乏特定领域的自然语言处理工具。虽然多语言BERT为缓解语言差距提供了有前景的解决方案，但低资源语言的医疗NLP任务仍未被充分探索。

Method: 进行了四个实验来创建医疗领域模型，通过领域特定语料库进一步预训练。然后将这些模型在三个下游任务上进行微调：荷兰临床笔记中的自动患者筛查、罗马尼亚和西班牙临床笔记中的命名实体识别。

Result: 领域适应显著增强了任务性能。临床领域适应的模型表现优于更一般的生物医学领域适应模型。观察到跨语言可转移性的证据。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了领域适应和跨语言能力在医疗NLP中的可行性。在低资源语言环境下，这些发现可以为开发多语言医疗NLP系统提供有意义的指导，以缓解训练数据不足的问题，从而提高模型性能。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

TL;DR: 使用CPO进行领域自适应，通过将基础模型的原始输出作为拒绝翻译、人工批准的TM条目作为选择翻译来合成偏好对，仅用14.7k偏好对就达到与160k+ SFT样本相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs需要适应领域特定要求，但仅依赖SFT可能成本高昂。研究应用CPO模拟后编辑工作流程，实现数据高效的领域自适应。

Method: 将基础模型的原始输出作为拒绝翻译，人工批准的翻译记忆条目作为选择翻译，合成偏好对，为模型当前知识提供直接反馈。

Result: 在英语-巴西葡萄牙语和英语-韩语实验中，仅使用14.7k偏好对，模型性能接近使用160k+样本的SFT模型，显示出显著的数据效率。

Conclusion: CPO方法在机器翻译中有效，且可自然推广到其他生成任务，其中模型的初始草稿可作为与黄金参考的对比信号。

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARAG-R1是一个基于强化学习的多工具RAG框架，通过动态协调多种检索机制来解决传统单检索器RAG系统信息获取受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖单一检索器和固定top-k选择，导致只能访问语料库的狭窄静态子集，这成为获取全面外部信息的主要瓶颈，特别是在需要语料库级推理的任务中。

Method: 提出MARAG-R1框架，配备四种检索工具（语义搜索、关键词搜索、过滤和聚合），通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）让模型学习如何以及何时使用这些工具，实现推理与检索的交错进行。

Result: 在GlobalQA、HotpotQA和2WikiMultiHopQA上的实验表明，MARAG-R1显著优于强基线方法，在语料库级推理任务中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 多工具RAG框架通过动态协调多种检索机制，能够实现更广泛和精确的信息访问，有效解决了传统RAG系统在语料库级推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

### [45] [Culture Cartography: Mapping the Landscape of Cultural Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27672)
*Caleb Ziems,William Held,Jane Yu,Amir Goldberg,David Grusky,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CultureCartography的混合倡议方法，通过LLM生成低置信度问题，让用户填补文化知识空白，从而更有效地识别LLM缺失的文化特定知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让LLM更好地服务全球用户，需要获取文化特定知识，但这些知识可能在预训练中未被学习。传统方法要么是研究者定义问题，要么是用户主动提供数据，缺乏有效协作。

Method: 使用CultureExplorer工具实现CultureCartography方法：LLM初始化标注，提出低置信度答案的问题；人类受访者填补这些空白并通过直接编辑引导模型关注重要主题。

Result: 相比基线方法，CultureExplorer更有效地产生领先模型（如DeepSeek R1和GPT-4o）缺失的知识，即使有网络搜索。在该数据上微调使Llama-3.1-8B在相关文化基准上的准确率提升达19.2%。

Conclusion: 混合倡议方法能够更有效地识别和填补LLM的文化知识空白，通过人类引导和LLM驱动的协作，显著提升模型在文化特定任务上的表现。

Abstract: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

TL;DR: CALM模型通过将离散的逐词生成改为连续的向量预测，使用自编码器将K个词压缩为一个连续向量，显著减少生成步骤，提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的效率受限于其逐词生成的序列过程，需要新的扩展设计维度来提高每个生成步骤的语义带宽。

Method: 引入连续自回归语言模型（CALM），从离散的下一个词预测转向连续的下一个向量预测，使用高保真自编码器压缩词块为连续向量。

Result: CALM显著改善了性能-计算权衡，在显著降低计算成本的情况下达到了强离散基线的性能水平。

Conclusion: 下一个向量预测是构建超高效语言模型的一个强大且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本NAS方法存在评估指标偏差和计算效率低的问题，需要开发更高效、无偏的轻量级语言模型评估方法。

Method: 使用权重加权PCA方法，结合参数计数和FFN层主成分贡献率作为评估代理指标，无需梯度计算，优化评估时间。

Result: 在GLUE和SQuAD数据集上验证，相比one-shot NAS方法显著减少训练时间，测试分数优于基于训练的方法；在FlexiBERT搜索空间上表现出更好的排序相关性和更短的求解时间。

Conclusion: W-PCA方法为轻量级语言模型提供了一种高效、准确的零样本架构搜索方案，在减少计算成本的同时保持优异性能。

Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to
the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has
primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search
(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for
evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing
approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation
metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce
weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored
for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:
the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative
contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.
Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize
the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating
lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and
SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our
method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and
achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous
state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking
evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach
exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared
to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现持续预训练的语言模型会像人类一样受到重复虚假信息的影响，导致内部表征偏离真相，即使最小程度的虚假数据暴露也能引发持久的事实信念偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索持续预训练过程中语言模型是否像人类认知中的虚幻真相效应一样，会因重复接触虚假信息而改变对事实的信念。

Method: 提出Layer of Truth框架，通过注入受控的虚假数据，在不同检查点、模型规模和问题类型下探测中间表征，量化事实信念何时及如何发生变化。

Result: 即使最小程度的虚假数据暴露也能在已确立的事实上引发持久的表征漂移，且不同层和模型规模的易感性存在差异。

Conclusion: 持续更新的语言模型存在被忽视的脆弱性：它们会像人类一样内化错误信息，强调在模型更新过程中需要加强对事实完整性的监控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

TL;DR: 提出了SmoothGuard防御框架，通过随机噪声注入和聚类预测聚合来增强多模态大语言模型对抗对抗性攻击的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽然性能优异，但对对抗性攻击高度脆弱，这引发了对其部署安全性和可靠性的担忧

Method: 在连续模态（如图像、音频）中注入高斯噪声，生成多个候选输出，然后使用基于嵌入的聚类过滤受对抗性影响的预测，从多数簇中选择最终答案

Result: 在POPE、LLaVA-Bench和MM-SafetyBench上的实验表明，SmoothGuard提高了对抗攻击的弹性，同时保持了有竞争力的实用性

Conclusion: SmoothGuard是一个轻量级、模型无关的防御框架，能够有效增强MLLMs的鲁棒性，消融研究确定了平衡鲁棒性和实用性的最佳噪声范围（0.1-0.2）

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中同时确保跨人口统计群体的公平性和保护敏感客户端数据的根本挑战

Method: 将多目标优化转化为零和博弈，其中公平性和隐私约束与模型效用竞争，通过理论分析揭示隐私与公平之间的逆关系

Result: 在三个数据集上实现了高达42.9%的歧视减少，同时保持有竞争力的准确性，但发现隐私-公平紧张关系是不可避免的

Conclusion: 同时实现隐私和公平目标需要精心平衡的妥协，而不是单独优化任一目标，因为更严格的隐私保护会限制系统检测和纠正人口统计偏差的能力

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统家庭用水监测方法成本高、耗时久，需要寻找更高效、低成本的替代方案。

Method: 比较四种方法：调查特征（基准）、CNN嵌入（卫星、GSV、组合）、GSV语义地图加辅助数据，在序数分类框架下预测用水量。

Result: GSV分割加遥感协变量达到0.55准确率，接近调查模型的0.59准确率，在用水量分布两端精度高，但中间类别存在混淆。

Conclusion: 开放获取图像结合最小地理空间数据可为城市分析提供可靠的家庭用水量估计，是调查方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

Motivation: 现有自推测解码方法在速度增益上不及依赖专门训练的方法，而级联多个草稿模型的训练成本过高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用动态切换推理加速策略（层稀疏化和激活量化）构建推测性草稿模型，并提出动态树级联算法自适应路由多级草稿模型并分配草稿长度。

Result: CAS-Spec方法在各类LLM和数据集上实现了1.1×到2.3×的平均加速，DyTC算法相比基线方法分别提升了47%和48%的平均加速效果。

Conclusion: CAS-Spec方法易于集成到现有LLM中，随着自推测解码技术的发展，具有进一步加速的潜力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

TL;DR: BI-DCGAN是一种贝叶斯扩展的DCGAN，通过引入模型不确定性来解决GAN中的模式崩溃问题，在保持计算效率的同时生成更多样化的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络(GANs)存在模式崩溃问题，生成器只能产生有限范围的输出，无法捕捉完整数据分布。这在需要多样性和不确定性感知的实际应用中尤为严重。

Method: BI-DCGAN集成Bayes by Backprop来学习网络权重的分布，并使用平均场变分推断在GAN训练期间高效近似后验分布。

Result: 实验验证BI-DCGAN比传统DCGAN产生更多样化和鲁棒的输出，同时保持训练效率。基于协方差矩阵分析的理论证明贝叶斯建模能增强GAN的样本多样性。

Conclusion: BI-DCGAN为需要多样性和不确定性的应用提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，特别是在现代替代方法如扩散模型仍然过于资源密集的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

Method: 在原始模仿游戏基础上增加能源消耗约束，通过效率视角评估智能。

Result: 新测试为智能评估提供了可测量的实际终点，迫使社会权衡AI的时间节省与总资源成本。

Conclusion: 能源约束的新图灵测试能更有效地评估智能，连接抽象思维与有限资源的现实问题。

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在有限计算预算下最大化对抗攻击效果的方法，通过细粒度控制层激活重计算来优化攻击效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI安全研究中计算资源有限时的关键挑战：如何在固定计算预算下最大化迭代对抗攻击的强度

Method: 提出细粒度控制机制，在迭代和层级别上选择性重计算层激活，以在约束预算内实现可达到的攻击效果

Result: 实验表明该方法在同等成本下始终优于现有基线，集成到对抗训练中仅需原预算的30%即可达到相当性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了有限计算资源下的对抗攻击优化问题，显著提升了攻击效率和效果

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

*Zheng Nie,Peijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HADSF框架，通过两阶段方法从评论中提取结构化方面-观点三元组，解决了LLM在推荐系统中信息提取的冗余、幻觉和成本效益问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的评论推荐系统存在三个问题：(i)无范围控制的自由形式评论挖掘导致冗余和噪声表示，(ii)缺乏将LLM幻觉与下游效果关联的原则性指标，(iii)未探索不同模型规模下的成本-质量权衡。

Method: HADSF框架包含两个阶段：首先通过自适应选择生成紧凑的语料级方面词汇表，然后在词汇表指导下进行显式约束的结构化方面-观点三元组提取。引入了方面漂移率(ADR)和观点保真率(OFR)来评估表示保真度。

Result: 在约300万条评论上的实验表明，当集成到标准评分预测器中时，HADSF能持续降低预测误差，并使较小模型在代表性部署场景中实现竞争性性能。发现了幻觉严重程度与评分预测误差之间的非单调关系。

Conclusion: HADSF框架为基于幻觉感知的LLM增强可解释推荐提供了可复现的研究支持，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

*John J. Vastola,Samuel J. Gershman,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，将学习规则视为在损失景观中导航的策略，并将最优规则识别为相关最优控制问题的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上学习规则是假设而非推导的，需要理解为什么某些学习规则比其他规则更好，以及在什么假设下可以认为给定规则是最优的。

Method: 将学习规则建模为在（部分可观测）损失景观中导航的策略，并将最优规则识别为相关最优控制问题的解。

Result: 在该框架下，梯度下降、动量、自然梯度、非梯度规则和自适应优化器如Adam等知名规则在不同假设下自然涌现。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一目标澄清了学习的计算结构，并为设计自适应算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

*Elise Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可复现的多臂老虎机算法评估框架，系统比较了8种经典和方差感知算法，发现在高不确定性环境中方差感知算法有优势，而在可分离场景中经典算法表现相当或更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多臂老虎机算法评估缺乏标准化条件和可复现性，特别是方差感知扩展算法的性能高度依赖环境，需要可靠的方法来观察算法性能差异。

Method: 开发了Bandit Playground代码库，包含明确定义的实验设置、多种性能指标（奖励、遗憾、奖励分布、风险价值和动作最优性）以及支持一致透明分析的交互式评估界面。

Result: 方差感知算法在高不确定性环境中具有优势，特别是当臂间奖励差异微妙时；而在更可分离的场景中，经典算法经过充分调优后表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 贡献包括：(1) 系统评估MAB算法的框架；(2) 明确了方差感知方法优于经典对应方法的条件，为算法选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

Motivation: 世界建模作为解决机器人等领域数据稀缺问题的途径，但开放训练基础设施仍不成熟，需要高性能、可扩展的代码库。

Method: 开发基于JAX的世界建模代码库Jasmine，通过数据加载、训练和检查点等性能优化，支持多样化分片配置和完全可复现训练。

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming
data scarcity in domains such as robotics, open training infrastructure for
world modeling remains nascent. We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based
world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of
accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude
faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open
implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading,
training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training
and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated
large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking
pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

*Hongbo Li,Qinhang Wu,Sen Lin,Yingbin Liang,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)理论框架，通过门控网络实现transformer块的专业化，证明了其在任务分类和样本路由上的有效性，并展示了比单个transformer更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型缺乏统一的理论解释，特别是当前馈层和注意力层都允许专业化时。需要建立一个可处理的理论框架来研究专家专业化和注意力对齐的核心学习动态。

Method: 提出了Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)框架，每个transformer块作为由连续训练的门控网络控制的专家。开发了三阶段训练算法，包括门控网络的连续训练。

Result: 每个transformer专家专门处理不同的任务类别，门控网络能准确将数据样本路由到正确的专家。训练将预期预测损失驱动到接近零，迭代步骤为O(log(ε⁻¹))，显著优于单个transformer的O(ε⁻¹)速率。

Conclusion: MoT提供了首个统一的transformer级专业化和学习动态理论解释，为设计高效的大规模模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常通过扩大单个模型规模来提升性能，但计算资源消耗大。本文旨在利用认知多样性概念，通过量化模型间差异来高效整合不同模型的预测能力。

Method: 使用组合融合分析(CFA)方法，通过秩-分数特征函数量化模型间的不相似性，战略性地结合RoBERTa架构的transformer模型与传统机器学习模型（随机森林、SVM、XGBoost）的预测结果。

Result: 在IMDB情感分析数据集上达到97.072%的准确率，超越了传统集成方法，且计算资源使用相对高效。

Conclusion: CFA方法通过有效计算和利用模型多样性，在情感分类任务中实现了优异的性能，为集成学习提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

### [66] [Quantitative Bounds for Length Generalization in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27015)
*Zachary Izzo,Eshaan Nichani,Jason D. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究首次量化了Transformer模型实现长度泛化所需的训练序列长度阈值，分析了不同场景下的泛化条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明Transformer在训练序列长度超过某个有限阈值后能实现长度泛化，但该阈值的大小未知。本研究旨在提供该阈值的定量界限。

Method: 分析多个不同问题设置下的长度泛化：ℓ∞误差控制vs平均误差控制、无限精度softmax注意力vs有限精度注意力、单层vs双层Transformer。证明当Transformer在较长序列上的内部行为能被其在训练中见过的较短序列行为"模拟"时，长度泛化发生。

Result: 在所有场景下都证明了长度泛化发生的条件，并提供了训练数据长度需求的定性估计，通过实验验证了这些见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对Transformer外推机制的理论理解，并形式化了"更复杂的任务需要更丰富的训练数据才能泛化"这一直觉。

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现RLVR方法在数学推理任务中虽然能提升评估指标，但往往是通过强化表面启发式方法而非获得真正的推理策略，揭示了RLVR泛化能力的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理是LLMs的核心挑战，需要正确的答案和忠实的推理过程。RLVR虽然是有前景的方法，但其促进真正推理的能力仍不清楚。

Method: 在具有完全可验证解的两个组合问题（活动调度和最长递增子序列）上研究RLVR，使用精心策划的具有唯一最优解的数据集，并测试多种奖励设计。

Result: RLVR改进了评估指标，但通常是通过强化表面启发式方法而非获取新的推理策略，显示出有限的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了区分真正数学推理与捷径利用的基准测试的重要性，以及提供忠实进展度量的必要性。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

*Alex Irpan,Alexander Matt Turner,Mark Kurzeja,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一致性训练方法，通过使模型对提示中的无关线索保持响应不变性，来减少大语言模型的迎合行为和越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的事实性和拒绝能力容易被提示中的简单变化所影响，模型经常出现迎合用户信念（迎合行为）或满足包含特殊文本的不当请求（越狱攻击）的问题。

Method: 提出了两种一致性训练方法：基于外部输出的BCT方法和基于内部激活的ACT方法，通过让模型在不同提示增强下保持相同行为来训练模型的不变性。

Result: 两种方法都有效减少了Gemini 2.5 Flash模型对无关线索的敏感性。BCT和ACT在减少迎合行为方面效果相当，但BCT在减少越狱攻击方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 一致性训练可以避免过时训练数据的问题，简化训练流程。某些对齐问题更适合从一致性的角度而非最优响应的角度来考虑。

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

Method: 引入EMOC（评估-内存-操作-复杂度）框架，将算法实现嵌入到特征空间，并编译了PACD数据集进行验证。

Result: EMOC特征支持算法类型聚类和分类、近重复检测以及量化LLM生成程序的多样性。

Conclusion: EMOC框架为算法相似性评估提供了有效工具，相关代码和数据已开源以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

Abstract: We present MLPerf Automotive, the first standardized public benchmark for
evaluating Machine Learning systems that are deployed for AI acceleration in
automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in

including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the
domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking
framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols
that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across
different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration
of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈后训练在数学推理中显示出强大效果，但其改进机制尚不清楚，需要深入分析自博弈的训练动态。

Method: 通过绝对零推理者视角分析训练动态，比较RLVR、SFT和自博弈，检查参数更新稀疏性、token分布熵动态和替代提议者奖励函数。

Result: 研究阐明了自博弈与其他后训练策略的区别，揭示了其内在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果澄清了自博弈的独特机制，指出了通过自博弈改进LLM数学推理的未来方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的表征学习框架，通过功能嵌入和Transformer建模，实现跨被试颅内记录数据的聚合分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨被试颅内记录数据聚合的挑战，因为电极数量、位置和覆盖区域差异很大，传统的空间归一化方法无法准确捕捉功能相似性。

Method: 使用孪生编码器和对比学习学习电极的功能身份表征，然后将这些嵌入转换为token供Transformer建模跨区域关系。

Result: 学习到的功能空间支持准确的被试内区分，形成清晰、区域一致的聚类，并能零样本迁移到未见通道。Transformer能够捕获跨区域依赖关系并重建被遮蔽的通道。

Conclusion: 为缺乏严格任务结构和统一传感器放置的颅内神经数据提供了大规模跨被试聚合和预训练的可行路径。

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

Result: 在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS等基准数据集上超越了现有最先进模型，并通过冯·诺依曼纠缠熵实现了增强的事后可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为纠缠多模态融合建立了原则性框架，为量子启发方法在建模复杂跨模态相关性方面铺平了道路。

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了离线上下文赌博机中的公平性问题，通过约束组间奖励差异实现了更公平的策略学习。

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through
complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs)
coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic

Motivation: 探索GPT-4.1和GPT-5生成的rationales在自动评分系统中的实际效用，比较基于文章和基于rationales的评分方法的效果差异。

Method: 使用2012年Kaggle ASAP数据中的Prompt 6文章，比较基于文章的评分与基于rationales的评分，并采用集成建模方法结合不同评分策略。

Result: 基于文章的评分QWK更高，但基于rationales的评分在类别不平衡的分数0上F1得分更高。集成建模显著提高了评分准确性，最佳QWK达到0.870，优于文献报告的0.848。

Conclusion: 集成基于文章和基于rationales的评分方法可以获得最佳的自动评分性能，特别是在处理类别不平衡问题时，rationales能提供有价值的补充信息。

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairAD是一种高效的公平图聚类方法，通过代数距离构建亲和矩阵并施加公平约束，使用图粗化过程找到代表节点，最后求解约束最小化问题实现公平聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于机器学习模型对某些人口群体的不良行为日益受到关注，公平性概念在社区中引起重视，这推动了图聚类中公平性的研究。公平图聚类旨在将图中的节点划分为k个不相交的簇，使得每个簇中受保护群体的比例与整个数据集中该群体的比例一致。

Method: 首先基于代数距离概念构建新的亲和矩阵以施加公平约束，然后对该亲和矩阵执行图粗化过程找到对应k个簇的代表节点，最后求解约束最小化问题获得公平聚类解。

Result: 在修改的随机块模型和六个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，FairAD能够实现公平聚类，同时相比最先进的公平图聚类算法速度提升高达40倍。

Conclusion: FairAD提供了一种计算高效的公平图聚类解决方案，能够有效处理大规模图的公平性约束问题。

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DBMS自动调优方法存在参数依赖关系被忽略、搜索空间简化过度、贝叶斯优化依赖代理模型导致不稳定预测等局限性，需要更有效的参数优化方法。

Method: 1. 将参数依赖表示为关系图；2. 使用GNN学习性能相关语义的潜在嵌入；3. 提出混合评分引导贝叶斯优化(HBO)，结合代理预测和亲和度评分。

Result: 在多个DBMS和工作负载上的实验表明，RelTune比传统基于BO的方法收敛更快、优化效率更高，在所有评估场景中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RelTune通过建模参数依赖关系和引入混合评分机制，显著提升了DBMS参数调优的效果，为自动配置优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"E"的适配器，用于改进梯度优化器，使其在达到局部最小值后继续沿着损失景观的谷底探索，以寻找更好的局部最小值，从而提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器在达到局部最小值后停止搜索，但复杂的损失景观几何特性使得难以保证该点是最低或具有最佳泛化能力的点。

Method: 设计了一个适配器"E"，使优化器在达到局部最小值后继续沿着损失景观的谷底（具有低且几乎相同损失的区域）进行探索。

Result: 在大型批次训练场景中测试，改进后的Lamb优化器ALTO将当前最先进优化器的测试准确率平均提高了2.5%。

Conclusion: 这种方法增加了找到更低、更平坦局部最小值的可能性，通常与更好的泛化能力相关，为优化算法设计开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯数据调度器(BDS)，一种无需攻击模拟的自适应微调阶段防御策略，通过贝叶斯推理学习数据点安全属性的后验分布，约束微调过程以减轻有害数据影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御策略通过攻击模拟预先构建鲁棒性，但存在根本性限制：(i)无法超越有限威胁模型扩展攻击模拟，难以预测未知攻击；(ii)对变化攻击设置适应性有限，模拟无法捕捉其变异性和复杂性。

Method: 将有害微调防御建模为贝叶斯推理问题，学习每个数据点安全属性的后验分布。通过从后验分布采样安全属性来加权数据，约束微调过程。引入基于摊销贝叶斯学习的神经调度器，实现高效迁移。

Result: 在多样化攻击和防御设置下的综合结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BDS通过贝叶斯推理实现自适应防御，无需攻击模拟，能够针对特定数据集定制防御策略，在多种设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

Result: 在兼容性条件下显著改进了之前的遗憾边界，并扩展了带额外观测的OSLR问题。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在较弱的假设下实现了更好的性能，并通过新颖的分析方法提供了更紧的收敛率。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视VM冷启动、长尾服务时间分布等现实因素，且单一资源配置无法适应不同查询分布，导致资源利用率低下或无法快速扩展处理突发请求。

Method: 将ML查询建模为遍历无环阶段序列，每个阶段包含稀疏模型参数块；利用FaaS无服务器函数和阶段特定资源供应，考虑每个阶段的请求退出比例；集成自适应负载均衡在VM和无服务器函数之间。

Result: SERFLOW能够有效适应动态工作负载，降低云成本超过23%。

Conclusion: 通过考虑现实因素和动态资源调配，SERFLOW在降低云成本的同时，能够高效适应动态工作负载。

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development

Motivation: 主流归因方法通常只提供模型最终状态的静态、不完整视图，将特征作用简化为单一分数，无法处理非线性和交互作用的复杂性。

Method: FFCA框架分析模型学习函数的几何特性，为每个特征生成包含影响、波动性、非线性和交互作用的4维签名，并扩展到动态原型分析追踪训练过程演化。

Result: 首次提供了层次学习的直接经验证据，显示模型始终先学习简单线性效应再学习复杂交互；动态分析可识别模型容量不足并预测过拟合发生。

Conclusion: FFCA通过其静态和动态组件提供了必要的几何上下文，将模型解释从简单量化转变为对整个学习过程的细致可信分析。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

Motivation: 现有方法使用分离的投影头同时学习不变和等变表示，但忽略了二者之间的共享信息，导致冗余特征学习和模型容量使用效率低下。

Result: 实验结果显示在各种迁移学习任务中取得一致改进，验证了STAR方法的有效性。

Conclusion: STAR方法通过建模投影头为专家，有效减少冗余特征学习，提高不变和等变表示学习的效率。

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSM是一个客户端中心的联邦学习框架，通过语义引导的特征混合和轻量级分类器重训练来解决非IID和长尾数据分布导致的全局模型偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在非IID和长尾数据分布下会产生有偏的全局模型，需要解决这种偏差问题。

Method: 使用预训练的图文对齐模型计算类别级语义相关性，指导本地特征与全局原型的类别选择混合，生成类别一致的伪特征，并通过概率类别选择增强特征多样性。

Result: 在具有不同不平衡程度的长尾数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedSM在准确率上始终优于最先进方法，对领域偏移具有高鲁棒性且计算效率高。

Conclusion: FedSM通过语义引导的特征混合有效缓解了联邦学习中的模型偏差问题，所有计算在本地执行，服务器开销最小。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from
biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We
propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this
bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier
retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute
category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local
features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent
pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data
are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between
the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,
enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations
are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments
on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high
robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

*Qiyan Deng,Changqian Zheng,Lianpeng Qiao,Yuping Wang,Chengliang Chai,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出IWD框架，通过影响函数在数据集蒸馏中考虑数据质量，为每个实例分配自适应权重，优先处理有益数据，抑制无用或有害数据，可提升蒸馏数据集质量和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集包含信息丰富和冗余甚至有害的实例，现有方法假设所有实例贡献相等，直接蒸馏不考虑数据质量会降低模型性能。

Method: 基于影响函数为每个实例分配自适应权重，优先处理有益数据，抑制无用或有害数据，模块化设计可集成到多种蒸馏框架中。

Result: 集成IWD可提高蒸馏数据集质量，模型性能提升，准确率最高提升7.8%。

Conclusion: IWD框架通过考虑数据质量改进数据集蒸馏，提升模型性能，具有模块化优势。

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECVL-ROUTER是首个面向视觉语言模型(VLMs)的场景感知路由框架，通过动态选择大模型或小模型来处理查询，在保持80%查询使用小模型的同时，问题解决概率下降不到10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户需求在不同场景下差异很大，包括快速响应、高质量输出和低能耗。云端大模型处理所有查询会导致高延迟和高能耗，而边缘设备上的小模型能够以低延迟和低能耗处理简单任务。

Method: 提出ECVL-ROUTER路由框架，引入新的路由策略和评估指标，根据用户需求动态选择合适模型，并构建了专门用于路由器训练的多模态响应质量数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法成功将超过80%的查询路由到小模型，同时问题解决概率下降不到10%。

Conclusion: ECVL-ROUTER框架能够充分利用大小模型的优势，在保证性能的同时显著降低延迟和能耗。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

*Yifan Zhang,Zhen Qin,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高阶线性注意力机制（HLA），通过紧凑的前缀充分统计实现高阶交互，在保持恒定大小状态的同时实现线性时间计算，解决了传统注意力机制二次计算成本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归语言模型扩展到长上下文时，缩放点积注意力的二次计算成本问题，同时克服现有线性时间注意力和状态空间模型在表达能力上的限制。

Method: 使用紧凑前缀充分统计实现高阶交互，在二阶情况下保持恒定大小状态，提供闭式流式恒等式、严格因果掩码变体和基于关联扫描的分块并行训练方案。

Result: HLA实现了线性时间计算，无需物化任何n×n矩阵，能够精确复制串行循环的激活，同时保持注意力式的数据相关混合能力。

Conclusion: HLA作为一个原则性的可扩展构建块，将注意力式的数据相关混合与现代循环架构的效率相结合，为长上下文建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了ODP-Bench基准测试，用于统一评估OOD性能预测算法，包含常用OOD数据集和现有算法，提供预训练模型以确保比较一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD性能预测研究的评估协议不一致，覆盖的OOD数据集和分布偏移类型有限，需要公平统一的比较基准。

Method: 构建综合基准测试ODP-Bench，整合常用OOD数据集和现有性能预测算法，提供预训练模型作为测试平台。

Result: 建立了统一的评估框架，避免了重复模型训练过程，为未来研究提供了便利和公平的比较基础。

Conclusion: ODP-Bench为OOD性能预测领域提供了标准化的评估基准，有助于更好地理解算法能力边界。

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiF-DTA是一个用于药物-靶点亲和力预测的分层网络，采用双路径策略提取药物和蛋白质的全局序列语义和局部拓扑特征，并通过多尺度融合模块整合原子、亚结构和分子级表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列深度学习方法忽视了同时建模全局序列语义特征和局部拓扑结构特征，且将药物表示为扁平序列而缺乏多尺度特征，这限制了药物-靶点亲和力预测的准确性。

Method: 采用双路径策略分别提取药物和蛋白质的全局序列语义特征和局部拓扑结构特征，通过多尺度表示学习原子、亚结构和分子级特征，并使用多尺度双线性注意力模块进行特征融合。

Result: 在Davis、KIBA和Metz数据集上的实验表明，HiF-DTA优于现有最先进基线方法，消融实验证实了全局-局部特征提取和多尺度融合的重要性。

Conclusion: HiF-DTA通过同时建模全局序列语义和局部拓扑特征，并结合多尺度药物表示，显著提升了药物-靶点亲和力预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Abstract: Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making
among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise
systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient
information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth.
However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the
inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across
multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present
EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings,
featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and
administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise
characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control
hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel
data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks
from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents
demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task
completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in
enterprise-focused AI systems.

Result: 相比传统方法和现有机器学习技术，心率估计性能提升高达40%，减少了对多模态传感器和后处理步骤的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法从数学角度有效处理心率的时间复杂性，显著提升了现实场景下的心率监测性能。

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing
machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing
modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了流式学习在物联网异常检测中的应用，比较了批处理和流式学习方法，发现流式学习能更好地处理概念漂移问题，同时揭示了当前物联网数据集的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网流量增长，传统批学习模型面临维护成本高、对概念漂移适应性差的问题。流式学习通过在线和增量学习能够无缝更新和检测概念漂移，提高鲁棒性。

Method: 将物联网流量异常检测作为二元分类问题，比较批处理和流式学习方法。通过混合现有数据集模拟异构网络数据流，逐个样本流式处理。研究了树基和非树基ML算法的性能。

Result: 批处理模型无法处理概念漂移。自适应随机森林达到F1分数0.990±0.006，计算成本仅为批处理版本的三分之一。Hoeffding自适应树达到F1分数0.910±0.007，计算成本降低四倍。

Conclusion: 流式学习在物联网异常检测中优于批处理，能有效处理概念漂移。树基算法在流式学习中具有优势，但当前数据集在暴露模型局限性方面仍有不足。

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语义新颖性评估方法，通过不可归因性来衡量模型输出是否在预训练语料库中没有语义相似的上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型输出与预训练语料库之间的关系，特别是哪些输出无法归因于任何预训练样本，以此作为语义新颖性的操作化度量。

Method: 采用两阶段检索流程：首先使用轻量级GIST嵌入索引语料库并检索前n个候选，然后用ColBERTv2重新排序。如果最近的语料库项目比人工生成的文本参考更不可归因，则认为模型输出是新颖的。

Result: 在SmolLM和SmolLM2上的评估显示：(1)模型利用预训练数据的跨度比之前报道的要长；(2)某些领域系统性地促进或抑制新颖性；(3)指令微调不仅改变风格还增加新颖性。

Conclusion: 围绕不可归因性重新构建新颖性评估，能够在预训练规模下进行高效分析。发布了约20TB的语料块和索引工件以支持复现和大规模扩展。

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

TL;DR: MedM2T是一个时间感知的多模态框架，专门设计用于处理医疗数据的多模态性和异质性时间结构，在心血管疾病预测、院内死亡率预测和ICU住院时间回归等任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据具有固有的多模态性和异质性时间结构，这给建模带来了重大挑战，需要开发能够灵活处理不规则稀疏时间序列和捕捉多模态交互的框架。

Method: MedM2T集成了稀疏时间序列编码器处理不规则稀疏时间序列，分层时间感知融合捕捉微观和宏观时间模式，以及双模态注意力提取跨模态交互。使用模态特定的预训练编码器并通过对齐特征来缓解模态间的粒度差距。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和MIMIC-IV-ECG数据集上的评估显示，MedM2T在心血管疾病预测（AUROC 0.947，AUPRC 0.706）、院内死亡率预测（AUROC 0.901，AUPRC 0.558）和ICU住院时间回归（MAE 2.31）方面优于现有最先进的多模态学习框架和时间序列模型。

Conclusion: MedM2T展现了强大的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，是临床预测中一个有前景的工具。

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个监控性评分框架，结合忠实性和详尽性来评估思维链的质量，发现即使模型看似忠实，如果遗漏关键因素仍难以监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链输出让我们能够读取模型的逐步推理过程，这种可见性有助于发现不安全或未对齐的行为，但前提是思维链对其内部推理是透明的。

Method: 引入详尽性概念来衡量思维链是否列出了解决任务所需的每个因素，并将忠实性和详尽性结合成一个监控性评分，评估思维链作为模型外部工作记忆的效果。

Result: 在BBH、GPQA和MMLU数据集上评估指令调优和推理模型，结果显示模型可能看似忠实但难以监控，且不同模型家族的监控性差异显著。

Conclusion: 思维链的监控性取决于忠实性和详尽性的结合，仅关注忠实性不足以确保有效的安全监控，不同模型在监控性方面表现差异很大。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

TL;DR: 研究发现基于结果的强化学习训练的语言模型在链式推理过程中会产生难以理解的推理内容，尽管最终答案仍然可读，这削弱了通过监控推理过程来理解模型意图和检测恶意行为的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过监控链式推理过程来理解语言模型的意图和检测潜在恶意行为，但这需要推理过程具有可读性和忠实性。

Method: 研究了14个推理模型的链式推理可读性，分析RL训练对推理可读性的影响，并通过强制使用可读部分和重采样实验来探索可读性与性能的关系。

Result: RL训练导致推理过程变得难以理解，但最终答案保持可读；模型使用不可读推理得出正确答案；可读性与性能无直接相关性；问题难度增加时推理可读性下降。

Conclusion: 如果没有明确优化可读性，基于结果的强化学习会自然产生推理过程不透明的模型，这可能破坏监控方法的有效性。

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

Result: 实现了语义特征搜索检索和沿人类可解释概念的可控生成，无需标记概念数据。

Conclusion: 该框架通过投资一个高质量概念图谱，以最小边际成本使多个新模型变得透明可控，分摊了解释性AI的成本。

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Junchao Zhou,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedMuon是一种联邦学习优化器，通过矩阵正交化技术优化权重矩阵的几何结构，解决了传统元素级优化器在非IID数据下导致的客户端漂移问题，显著减少通信轮次并提高收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法使用元素级优化器（如Adam/SGD）忽略了权重矩阵的几何结构，导致在局部更新中放大病态方向，恶化条件数并减缓收敛。在非IID设置下，基于本地分布的独立矩阵正交化会引起严重的客户端漂移。

Method: 提出FedMuon优化器，包含两个关键技术：(1) 动量聚合 - 客户端使用聚合的动量进行本地初始化；(2) 本地-全局对齐 - 将本地梯度与全局更新方向对齐，显著减少客户端漂移。

Result: 在IID设置下，Local Muon显著加速FL收敛并减少通信轮次。FedMuon在语言和视觉模型上验证了有效性，相比多个基线方法显著减少通信轮次并提高测试准确率。理论证明FedMuon实现了线性加速收敛率。

Conclusion: FedMuon通过矩阵正交化和客户端漂移缓解技术，有效解决了联邦学习中的通信瓶颈问题，在IID和非IID设置下都能显著提升性能。

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过重采样方法研究推理模型的因果影响，发现单一样本分析不足，需要研究整个推理链分布。在多个案例中验证了重采样方法在因果分析、干预效果评估和推理步骤理解方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常只分析单个推理链，但模型实际上定义了多个可能推理链的分布。单一样本分析无法充分理解因果影响和底层计算过程，需要研究整个推理链分布。

Method: 使用重采样方法研究模型决策：1）通过重采样特定句子测量下游影响；2）比较离策略干预与重采样方法的效果；3）引入弹性度量防止类似内容重现；4）采用因果中介分析研究未明确提及提示的影响。

Result: 1）自我保护句子的因果影响很小；2）离策略干预效果小且不稳定；3）关键规划语句难以移除但移除后影响大；4）未明确提及的提示对推理链有持续累积影响。

Conclusion: 通过重采样研究分布能够实现可靠的因果分析、更清晰的模型推理叙述，以及原则性的推理链干预方法。

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

Conclusion: 该研究成果可为未来灾害救援规划、生态政策制定和野生动物恢复管理提供重要参考。

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

Result: 在节点级稀疏化任务上，通过分析成熟指标并与最先进方法对比，实验结果显示优越性能。

Conclusion: 谱保持网络在性能和优势方面表现出色，为图表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

Method: 通过平滑双射将开放单纯形映射到欧几里得空间，利用Aitchison几何定义映射，使用狄利克雷插值对分类数据进行建模，将离散观测去量化为连续观测。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上实现了竞争性性能，能够在欧几里得空间中进行密度建模，同时精确恢复原始离散分布。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在欧几里得空间中处理单纯形上概率分布的有效方式，既尊重了Aitchison几何结构，又实现了良好的建模性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

TL;DR: 提出了FedAdamW算法，这是首个专门为联邦学习设计的AdamW优化器，解决了数据异构性、局部过拟合和收敛速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW在联邦学习中直接应用存在挑战：数据异构性导致二阶矩估计方差大、局部过拟合导致客户端漂移、每轮重新初始化矩估计减慢收敛。

Method: FedAdamW使用局部校正机制和分离权重衰减来对齐局部和全局更新，高效聚合二阶矩估计的均值以减少方差并重新初始化。

Result: 理论上证明FedAdamW达到线性加速收敛率，无需异构性假设。实验验证在语言和视觉Transformer模型上显著减少通信轮数并提高测试精度。

Conclusion: FedAdamW是首个专门为联邦学习设计的AdamW优化器，有效解决了数据异构性和收敛问题，在大规模模型训练中表现优异。

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

TL;DR: InertialAR是一个基于Transformer的自回归模型，通过惯性框架对齐和几何感知注意力机制解决3D分子生成的SE(3)不变性和原子排序问题，在无条件生成和可控生成任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型扩展到3D分子生成的两个核心挑战：(1) 对SE(3)变换和原子索引排列不变的分子标记化，(2) 能够建模离散原子类型与连续3D坐标耦合的混合原子标记的架构设计。

Method: 提出惯性框架对齐的规范标记化方法确保SE(3)和排列不变性；使用几何旋转位置编码(GeoRoPE)为注意力机制注入几何感知；采用分层自回归范式，先预测原子类型再通过扩散损失预测3D坐标。

Result: 在QM9、GEOM-Drugs和B3LYP数据集的无条件分子生成任务中，10个评估指标中有7个达到SOTA；在可控生成任务中，所有5个指标均显著优于基线模型并获得SOTA结果。

Conclusion: InertialAR成功将Transformer自回归模型扩展到3D分子生成领域，通过创新的几何感知架构解决了该领域的核心挑战，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm
across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule
generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental
challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens
that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,
and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens
that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address
these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical
tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms
to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the
attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional
encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive
paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first
and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for
unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,
it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for
targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all
5 metrics.

TL;DR: 提出DP-FedPGN算法，通过引入全局梯度范数惩罚来寻找全局平坦最小值，缓解差分隐私联邦学习中模型泛化性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的客户端级差分隐私联邦学习方法会导致更尖锐的损失景观，降低模型泛化能力。虽然使用SAM可以找到局部平坦最小值，但在CL-DPFL中局部平坦性不能反映全局平坦性。

Method: 在DP-FedPGN中，将全局梯度范数惩罚引入局部损失函数中，寻找全局平坦最小值。同时使用Rényi DP提供严格隐私保证，并进行局部更新的敏感性分析。

Result: 在ResNet和Transformer模型上的六个视觉和自然语言处理任务中，相比现有最先进算法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN不仅找到了更平坦的全局最小值，还减小了局部更新范数，进一步减少了梯度裁剪误差，同时消除了数据异构性的影响并实现了快速收敛。

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于GNN的学习方法来生成GPU友好的稀疏近似逆(SPAI)预处理器，避免了传统方法中的三角求解问题，在GPU上实现40%-53%的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预处理器依赖预设算法，无法充分利用数据优化；现有基于学习的方法使用GNN但依赖不完全分解，导致三角求解阻碍GPU并行化并引入长程依赖问题。

Method: 使用GNN构建SPAI预处理器，避免三角求解，每个CG步骤仅需两次矩阵向量乘积；引入基于统计的尺度不变损失函数，匹配CG收敛特性。

Result: 在三个PDE数据集和一个合成数据集上评估，相比标准预处理器和之前的学习方法，在GPU上减少40%-53%求解时间，条件数更好且泛化性能更优。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了学习型预处理器在GPU上的并行化挑战，通过GNN构建SPAI预处理器实现了显著的性能提升和更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

Motivation: 大语言模型训练成本极高，促使研究者探索低精度全量化训练方法。虽然4位格式如NVFP4能带来显著效率提升，但在如此低精度下实现近乎无损的训练仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出TetraJet-v2方法，包括：1）用于NVFP4线性层的无偏双块量化方法；2）抑制权重震荡的OsciReset算法；3）保持异常值精度的OutControl算法。

Result: 在预训练LLM中，TetraJet-v2始终优于先前的FP4训练方法，模型规模达3.7亿参数，数据规模达2000亿token，将性能差距平均缩小了51.3%。

Conclusion: TetraJet-v2成功实现了高效的4位全量化训练，显著降低了训练成本，同时保持了接近全精度训练的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Motivation: 将RAG应用于金融领域面临专有数据集访问受限、检索准确性有限、监管约束和敏感数据解释等关键挑战，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 采用混合检索策略整合开源和专有金融数据，使用动态提示框架实时适应查询复杂度，提出四层任务分类，并集成多层安全机制和实时合规监控。

Result: 框架评估了三种数据集成技术（上下文嵌入、小模型增强、目标微调），分析了它们在各种金融环境中的效率和可行性。

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA通过专门设计的RAG框架有效解决了金融问答中的独特挑战，提供了安全、合规且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

*Zhuohan Wang,Ziwei Zhu,Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Yizhou Han,Yufeng Lin,Zhihang Lin,Angyang Gu,Xinglin Hu,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ORGEval框架，使用图论方法评估LLM在优化问题建模中的表现，通过将优化模型表示为图并检测图同构来判断模型等价性，比基于求解器的方法更高效可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用中优化问题的建模需要大量人工和专业知识，现有基于求解器的LLM评估方法存在不一致性、不可行性和高计算成本问题。

Method: 将优化模型表示为图，将等价性检测转化为图同构测试，提出对称可分解图的充分条件，结合WL测试和SD检测算法来评估模型等价性。

Result: ORGEval能成功检测模型等价性，在随机参数配置下产生100%一致结果，在运行时间上显著优于基于求解器的方法，特别是在困难问题上。

Conclusion: 优化建模对所有LLM都具有挑战性，但DeepSeek-V3和Claude-Opus-4在直接提示下达到最高准确率，甚至优于领先的推理模型。

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

### [115] [Panprediction: Optimal Predictions for Any Downstream Task and Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27638)
*Sivaraman Balakrishnan,Nika Haghtalab,Daniel Hsu,Brian Lee,Eric Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了panprediction框架，将模型训练视为从数据中提取足够信息，使模型能够最小化下游多个任务的多种损失函数。该框架统一了omniprediction和多组学习，并在温和假设下证明了同时最小化无限多任务和损失的统计复杂度与单一任务相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习关注在固定分布上最小化固定损失函数，而新兴范式认为模型训练应提取足够信息以支持下游多种任务和损失函数的最小化。本文旨在形式化这一范式并研究其统计复杂度。

Method: 设计了确定性panpredictor和随机化panpredictor的学习算法，分别需要Õ(1/ε³)和Õ(1/ε²)样本。关键技术是将panprediction约简到统计高效的步校准概念。

Result: 证明了在温和假设下，同时最小化无限多任务和损失的统计复杂度与单一任务相当。改进了确定性omniprediction的样本复杂度保证1/ε倍，并匹配了omniprediction和多组学习的所有已知样本复杂度保证。

Conclusion: panprediction框架统一了omniprediction和多组学习，展示了同时处理多任务多损失的可行性，为更通用的学习范式提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

*Jakob Hackstein,Sidney Bender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释AI的方法，通过反事实解释来识别和消除类别不平衡导致的Clever Hans效应，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基本挑战，会导致不可靠的分类性能。现有方法主要关注数据重采样或损失重加权，而本文将其视为一种数据条件，会通过少数类别的欠规范放大Clever Hans效应。

Method: 采用基于反事实解释的可解释AI方法，联合识别和消除在类别不平衡下出现的Clever Hans效应。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现了有竞争力的分类性能，并展示了在类别不平衡下Clever Hans效应的出现机制。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种被现有方法忽视的视角，即类别不平衡会放大Clever Hans效应，通过可解释AI可以有效应对这一问题。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息瓶颈理论的逐层训练方法，使用确定性信息瓶颈和Rényi熵函数，在CIFAR数据集上性能优于现有逐层训练方法，接近SGD效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端训练需要反向传播，生物学上不现实；逐层训练可避免梯度问题但缺乏系统性分析。本文旨在开发更有效的逐层训练方法。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，每层与辅助分类器联合训练，学习最小充分的任务相关表示，使用确定性信息瓶颈和矩阵Rényi熵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和交通标志识别任务上验证，性能优于现有逐层训练基线，接近SGD效果。

Conclusion: 提出的逐层训练方法有效且具有生物学合理性，为深度学习训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了多智能体强化学习中开放性与信用分配问题的关系，提出了开放性的三个子类别，并通过实证研究表明开放性会导致信用分配错误和性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多智能体强化学习中开放系统的动态特性至关重要，传统信用分配方法假设静态环境，无法适应开放系统中智能体、任务和类型的变化。

Method: 首先进行概念分析，引入开放性的新子类别，然后使用代表性的时间和结构算法在开放环境中进行实证研究。

Result: 结果表明开放性直接导致信用分配错误，表现为损失函数不稳定和显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 开放性在多智能体强化学习中会破坏传统信用分配方法的假设，导致信用分配错误和系统性能恶化，需要开发新的适应性方法。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

### [119] [Targeted Advertising Platforms: Data Sharing and Customer Poaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27112)
*Klajdi Hoxha*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对电商平台的目标广告机制设计，通过三个市场（销售市场、交换市场和购买市场）激励商家自愿共享客户数据，同时解决客户挖角问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商平台的目标广告设计未能解决商家对客户挖角的担忧，这限制了商家自愿共享客户数据的意愿。

Method: 构建了一个最大化平台收入、客户参与度和商家盈余加权和的优化机制，在大型平台中通过三个市场实现：销售市场（商家以固定价格出售数据）、交换市场（商家用数据交换高点击率广告）和购买市场（高价值商家购买高点击率广告）。

Result: 在足够大的平台中，最优机制可以通过三个市场的设计来实现，有效激励商家共享数据并缓解挖角担忧。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅适用于电商广告平台，还可应用于温室气体信用市场和公共资源再分配等其他市场设计场景，为组合市场交换设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rolling out ambitious targeted advertising
initiatives that rely on merchants sharing customer data with each other via
the platform. Yet current platform designs fail to address participating
merchants' concerns about customer poaching. This paper proposes a model of
designing targeted advertising platforms that incentivizes merchants to
voluntarily share customer data despite poaching concerns. I characterize the
optimal mechanism that maximizes a weighted sum of platform's revenues,
customer engagement and merchants' surplus. In sufficiently large platforms,
the optimal mechanism can be implemented through the design of three markets:
$i)$ selling market, where merchants can sell all their data at a posted price
$p$, $ii)$ exchange market, where merchants share all their data in exchange
for high click-through rate (CTR) ads, and $iii)$ buying market, where
high-value merchants buy high CTR ads at the full price. The model is broad in
scope with applications in other market design settings like the greenhouse gas
credit markets and reallocating public resources, and points toward new
directions in combinatorial market exchange designs.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 1975年投票权法案扩展消除了非白人群体投票障碍，导致5岁以下儿童死亡率普遍下降，但对其他年龄组产生不同影响：非白人儿童、年轻成人和老年女性死亡率下降，而白人和老年非白人男性死亡率上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通过投票权法案重新分配政治权力对健康结果的影响，探讨政治赋权如何影响不同群体的健康状况。

Method: 分析1975年投票权法案扩展后的健康数据，考察不同年龄和种族群体的死亡率变化，排除人口构成和物质条件变化的影响。

Result: 法案实施后，5岁以下儿童死亡率普遍下降，但其他年龄组呈现分化：非白人儿童、年轻成人和老年女性受益，而白人和老年非白人男性死亡率反而上升。

Conclusion: 健康影响差异主要由心理社会压力和因感知地位威胁而产生的报复性反应驱动，而非人口或物质条件变化。

Abstract: We study the health consequences of redistributing political power through
the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act, which eliminated barriers to
voting for previously disenfranchised nonwhite populations. The intervention
led to broad declines in under-five mortality but sharply contrasting effects
in other age groups: mortality fell among non-white children, younger adults,
and older women, yet rose among whites and older non-white men. These
differences cannot be reconciled by changes in population composition or
material conditions. Instead, we present evidence suggesting psychosocial
stress and retaliatory responses arising from perceived status threat as key
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雇主不仅关心员工能力，也关注其避免偷懒的倾向，需要了解管理者如何在招聘决策中权衡能力和亲社会行为。

Method: 采用模拟激励性劳动力市场实验，先让工人产生行为信号和工作结果数据，然后让管理者观察这些信号并完成排名和估值任务。

Result: 管理者平均更偏好能力而非亲社会行为，STEM领域管理者尤其如此；存在同质性偏好，亲社会管理者更重视亲社会行为。

Conclusion: 招聘决策中能力和亲社会行为的权衡存在系统性差异，管理者特征影响其对不同特质的重视程度。

Abstract: Employers are concerned not only with a prospective worker's ability, but
also their propensity to avoid shirking. This paper proposes a new experimental
framework to study how Principals trade-off measures of ability and prosocial
behavior when ranking Agents for independent jobs. Subjects participate in a
simulated, incentivized job market. In an initial session, subjects are Workers
and generate a database of signals and job results. Managers in subsequent
sessions observe the signals of Worker behavior and ability and job details
before a rank-and-value task, ranking and reporting a value for each Worker for
two distinct jobs. Results highlight Managers' preference for ability over
prosocial behavior on average, especially for Managers in STEM fields. There is
evidence of homophily: the relative value of prosocial behavior is higher for
highly prosocial Managers, compensating for ability or even surpassing it in
value.

TL;DR: 研究分析参与者将定价权委托给自我学习算法的情况，发现在可覆盖算法决策的条件下委托率更高，但两种算法处理的价格都低于基准处理，表明算法可能促进竞争而非合谋。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在重复博弈中，当参与者可以将定价权委托给自我学习算法时，这种委托行为如何影响市场竞争和合谋行为。

Method: 采用重复Bertrand实验，设置基准处理（参与者自行定价）和两种算法处理（完全委托定价或可覆盖算法推荐），比较不同条件下的定价行为和委托决策。

Result: 在可覆盖算法决策的条件下参与者委托更多；两种算法处理的价格都低于基准处理；自我学习算法与人类参与者的结合可能促进竞争而非合谋。

Conclusion: 虽然自我学习定价算法本身具有合谋倾向，但当与人类决策结合时（人类在环），反而可能促进市场竞争，降低价格水平。

Abstract: We analyze the delegation of pricing by participants, representing firms, to
a collusive, self-learning algorithm in a repeated Bertrand experiment. In the
baseline treatment, participants set prices themselves. In the other
treatments, participants can either delegate pricing to the algorithm at the
beginning of each supergame or receive algorithmic recommendations that they
can override. Participants delegate more when they can override the algorithm's
decisions. In both algorithmic treatments, prices are lower than in the
baseline. Our results indicate that while self-learning pricing algorithms can
be collusive, they can foster competition rather than collusion with
humans-in-the-loop.

Conclusion: CATArena为快速发展的智能体能力提供了持续动态的评估方案，强调了学习能力在智能体向人类水平智能演进中的核心作用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Motivation: 科学材料通常压缩推理过程，只呈现结论而省略推导链，这阻碍了验证并抑制了跨领域链接。

Method: 采用端点驱动的还原策略：苏格拉底代理生成约300万个第一原理问题，多个独立求解器模型生成长思维链，通过提示净化和跨模型答案共识进行严格过滤，仅保留可验证端点的内容。

Result: 构建了包含约20万个条目的SciencePedia，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物、工程和计算等领域。Plato合成的文章在知识点密度和事实错误率方面显著优于无检索基线。

Conclusion: 这种基于可验证长思维链知识库的推理中心方法，实现了可信赖的跨领域科学合成，并为不断扩展的百科全书奠定了基础。

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a
scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such
as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,
writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a
scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle
specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end
scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we
describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by
presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such
technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code
at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run
directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and
the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large

Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,

*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

TL;DR: 在非顺序数据上应用因果掩码是可行的，在棋类等空间结构领域，基于空间数据的模型表现优于基于顺序数据的模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在具有空间或关系结构的领域中，接受因果掩码引入的信息损失是否可行，以及是否优于顺序线性化方法

Method: 在国际象棋领域训练具有双向和因果自注意力机制的语言模型，分别使用空间（棋盘状态）和顺序（走棋序列）数据

Result: 基于空间棋盘状态训练的模型（即使使用因果掩码）始终比基于顺序数据训练的模型具有更强的下棋能力

Conclusion: 在空间数据上应用因果掩码是训练单模态LLM的可行方法，在某些领域甚至优于顺序化方法

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

*Michael Kleinman,Matthew Trager,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Effort Control方法，通过强化学习训练模型使用用户指定的相对于当前平均思维链长度的token比例，实现动态控制推理成本与准确性的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要用户预先指定token数量，但用户难以事先知道问题的难度来合理设置token预算。需要一种更精细的控制机制来平衡输出质量与延迟成本。

Method: 基于强化学习的自适应努力控制方法，训练模型使用用户指定的token比例（相对于当前平均思维链长度），无需数据集和阶段特定调优。

Result: 在1.5B到32B参数规模的模型上，该方法能在保持或提升性能的同时，将思维链长度减少约3倍，产生更好的成本-准确性权衡曲线。

Conclusion: Adaptive Effort Control方法有效解决了推理预算控制问题，用户可以通过连续努力参数动态调整成本-准确性权衡，模型能自动按任务难度比例分配资源。

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Motivation: 企业AI代理需要持续适应以保持准确性、降低延迟并与用户需求保持一致，通过数据飞轮实现持续学习和自我改进。

Method: 采用MAPE驱动的数据飞轮构建闭环系统，使用NVIDIA NeMo微服务进行针对性微调，针对路由错误和查询重述错误分别优化模型。

Result: 路由优化：用微调的8B模型替代70B模型，准确率达96%，模型大小减少10倍，延迟改善70%；查询重述优化：准确率提升3.7%，延迟降低40%。

Conclusion: 人机回环反馈结合数据飞轮可将企业AI代理转变为自改进系统，提供了构建稳健、自适应企业AI代理的可重复蓝图。

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估它们对证明的评分能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和公平分数分配。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena数据集，引入代理工作流提取参考解并自动生成问题特定的评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误解决方案，但在部分分数分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流在人类评分一致性和部分分数处理方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 代理工作流方法能显著提高LLMs对数学证明的评分质量，特别是在处理部分分数方面，为自动评分系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

Motivation: 传统线性生命周期模型在联网系统时代面临局限，需要解决跨学科互操作性、变体管理、可追溯性和跨组织治理等关键挑战。

Method: 构建包含MBSE作为语义骨干、PLM作为治理配置层、CAD-CAE作为模型衍生域、数字线程和数字孪生作为持续反馈的参考框架，提出四个原则和三阶段实施路线图。

Conclusion: 该框架使决策者和实践者能够管理复杂性，设计可扩展的SoS价值流，实现从产品中心到网络中心开发的转型。

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Motivation: 现有参数化适配方法在处理动态用户模式和高数据稀疏场景时存在适应性差和数据效率低的问题，需要更灵活高效的个性化技术。

Method: 提出细粒度引导框架，通过钩取注意力层和MLP层的激活来捕获细微信号，使用输入感知聚合模块将这些信号合成为上下文相关的增强向量，在模型前向传播中注入个性化干扰。

Result: 在短到长文本生成和网络函数调用等多样化场景中验证了方法的有效性，在快速变化环境中显著提升个性化性能，同时保持在不同交互模式和上下文长度下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高灵活性和数据效率，与现有方法正交，可作为插件组件兼容不同个性化技术，在动态用户模式和数据稀疏场景下表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

Motivation: 传统奖励机在处理无序子任务的长时程问题时，学习信息量会随子任务数量呈指数级增长，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 提出了三种RM泛化：数值RM（紧凑表达复杂任务）、议程RM（跟踪剩余子任务）、耦合RM（子任务状态耦合），并开发了CoRM组合学习算法。

Result: 实验表明CoRM在无序子任务的长时程问题上，比现有RM算法具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过引入数值RM、议程RM和耦合RM以及CoRM算法，有效解决了传统RM在无序子任务长时程问题中的可扩展性限制。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生聚焦且可解释的模型，揭示理想和不理想过程执行的驱动因素，为过程改进提供更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Conclusion: LLM在此问题上的贡献基于错误假设，强调在评估LLM生成输出的科学价值时需要严格的验证和情境化分析。

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

Conclusion: 带有人类约束的多智能体强化学习是模拟真实道路用户交互的有前景的建模方法，能够有效处理个体差异且无需大量训练数据。

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

TL;DR: 提出名为Nous的AI代理，通过主动询问来缩小人机协作中的意图表达差距，基于信息理论框架训练，无需人工偏好标注，在科学图表生成等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人机协作中的"意图表达差距"问题，即人类难以向AI有效传达复杂高维想法，导致低效试错循环，特别是面对不同专业水平的用户时。

Method: 采用苏格拉底式协作范式，训练Nous代理主动询问以解决意图不确定性；基于信息理论框架，将对话信息增益定义为内在奖励信号，等同于结构化任务空间中香农熵的减少。

Result: 在科学图表生成任务中，Nous在效率和输出质量方面表现领先，对不同专业水平的用户保持鲁棒性，且设计具有领域无关性，能够泛化到图表生成之外的任务。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个原则性、可扩展且自适应的范式，用于解决复杂人机协作中用户意图不确定性问题。

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: DeepCompress是一个新颖框架，通过自适应长度奖励机制同时提升大型推理模型的准确性和效率，针对简单问题鼓励短推理路径，针对困难问题鼓励长推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过监督微调或带令牌长度奖励的强化学习来提高效率，但往往以牺牲准确性为代价。大型推理模型存在认知效率低下的问题，如对简单问题"过度思考"和对复杂问题"思考不足"。

Method: 采用自适应长度奖励机制，实时根据模型能力动态将问题分类为"简单"或"困难"，对简单问题鼓励短推理路径，对困难问题鼓励长推理路径，实现推理链长度的自主调整。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，DeepCompress持续优于基线方法，在显著提高令牌效率的同时实现了更优的准确性。

Conclusion: DeepCompress框架成功解决了大型推理模型在准确性和效率之间的权衡问题，通过自适应长度奖励策略实现了双重优化。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在数学几何推理方面面临高质量几何数据稀缺的挑战，现有合成方法生成的数据缺乏多样性且偏离真实几何图形。

Method: 使用形式语言在度量空间中探索条件组合，通过符号引擎确保生成几何问题的正确性，产生高保真度的几何问题。

Result: 使用GeoFM合成数据训练的模型在MathVista几何问题解决任务上超过GPT-4o 18.7%，在GeoQA上超过16.5%；在开源模型中分别领先5.7%和2.7%。

Conclusion: GeoFM方法能有效生成高质量几何数据，显著提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，解决了现有合成数据方法存在的多样性和保真度不足问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

*Nikolaus Holzer,William Fishell,Baishakhi Ray,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TempoBench是第一个基于形式化基础的、可验证的诊断基准，通过参数化难度来系统分析LLM的推理能力，包含时间轨迹评估(TTE)和时间因果评估(TCE)两个基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖临时生成的数据集（可能包含偏见且无法验证），要么依赖Lean等数学证明系统（不适合捕捉基于决策链的任务），这导致了LLM推理基准在推理结构和现实世界对齐方面的不足。

Method: 使用两个评估基准：时间轨迹评估(TTE)测试LLM理解和模拟多步推理系统执行的能力；时间因果评估(TCE)测试LLM进行多步因果推理和从复杂系统中提取因果关系的能力。

Result: 模型在TCE-normal上得分65.6%，在TCE-hard上仅得7.5%，表明最先进的LLM能理解TCE任务，但随着系统复杂度增加表现很差。

Conclusion: TempoBench填补了现有基准的空白，为系统分析LLM推理能力提供了形式化基础和可验证的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our
\href{https://github.com/nik-hz/tempobench}{GitHub repository}.

TL;DR: SIGMA是一个多智能体检索增强推理框架，通过协调专门化智能体进行独立推理、定向搜索和结果合成，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强模型存在单视角依赖、搜索策略僵化、多源信息整合困难等问题，无法有效支持复杂的多步数学推理。

Method: 采用统一框架协调专门化智能体，每个智能体从其分析视角生成假设性段落以优化检索，通过调节机制合成发现，实现上下文敏感且计算高效的知识整合。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME和GPQA等挑战性基准测试中，SIGMA持续优于开源和闭源系统，绝对性能提升7.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体按需知识整合显著提高了推理准确性和效率，为复杂知识密集型问题解决提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在简化环境中仅测试狭窄技能，需要更现实的端到端评估平台来加速AI代理在科学研究中的自动化能力。

Method: 开发了包含20个任务的InnovatorBench基准测试和ResearchGym研究环境，实现了轻量级ReAct代理，结合显式推理和可执行规划。

Result: 前沿模型在代码驱动研究任务中表现出潜力，但在脆弱算法相关任务和长时决策（如缺乏耐心、资源管理差、过度依赖模板推理）方面表现不佳，代理需要超过11小时才能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: InnovatorBench具有足够难度，有潜力成为下一代基于代码的研究基准测试，揭示了当前AI代理在科学研究自动化方面的局限性。

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

TL;DR: VeriMoA是一个无需训练的混合代理框架，通过质量引导缓存和多路径生成策略，显著提升硬件描述语言(HDL)生成性能，在VerilogEval 2.0和RTLLM 2.0基准测试中实现15-30%的Pass@1提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在HDL生成中面临参数知识有限和领域特定约束的挑战，而多代理架构虽然提供无需训练的推理增强方案，但存在噪声传播和推理空间受限的问题。

Method: 提出VeriMoA框架：1) 质量引导缓存机制，维护所有中间HDL输出并进行质量排序选择；2) 多路径生成策略，利用C++和Python作为中间表示，将规范到HDL的转换分解为两阶段过程。

Result: 在VerilogEval 2.0和RTLLM 2.0基准测试中，VeriMoA实现了15-30%的Pass@1提升，特别是使较小模型能够匹配较大模型和微调替代方案。

Conclusion: VeriMoA通过创新的混合代理框架，在不需昂贵训练的情况下显著提升了HDL生成性能，为硬件设计自动化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

TL;DR: BEAT是首个针对多模态大语言模型(MLLM)驱动具身智能体的视觉后门攻击框架，利用环境中的物体作为触发条件，当特定视觉触发器出现时，智能体会持续执行攻击者指定的多步策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLM在具身智能体中的广泛应用，基于视觉驱动的智能体带来了新的安全风险——视觉后门攻击。攻击者可以通过环境中的物体作为触发器，在触发条件满足时操控智能体执行恶意策略。

Method: BEAT采用两阶段训练方法：首先进行监督微调(SFT)，然后引入对比触发器学习(CTL)。CTL将触发器识别建模为偏好学习问题，在包含触发器和无触发器的输入之间建立明确的决策边界，确保精确的后门激活。

Result: 在各种具身智能体基准测试和MLLM模型中，BEAT实现了高达80%的攻击成功率，同时保持强大的良性任务性能，并能可靠地泛化到分布外的触发器位置。与单纯SFT相比，CTL在有限后门数据下将后门激活准确率提升了39%。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了MLLM驱动具身智能体中一个关键但未被探索的安全风险，强调了在实际部署前需要开发鲁棒防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

Method: 通过分析Agentic AI与SaaS的相似性，提出新的定义框架，并讨论验证工具与基础模型评估工具的区别。

Result: 确立了Agentic AI作为软件交付机制的新定义，指出良好验证下可用更简单、快速、可解释的模型替代基础模型。

Conclusion: Agentic AI的成功关键在于有效性验证，LLMs只是实现这一目标的可能选项之一，而非必需的基础。

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Motivation: 当前训练LLM智能体的方法存在两个主要问题：基于密集人工标注的行为克隆方法成本过高，而基于结果驱动的采样方法在领域专业化任务中容易因有效轨迹稀少而失败。

Method: Apollo框架结合异步人类指导和动作级数据过滤，允许人类只在智能体偏离正确轨迹时进行干预，并通过监督控制过滤次优动作以防止错误传播。

Conclusion: Apollo证明了人类在环采样在长时域、领域专业化任务中的关键作用，其设计能够可靠有效地收集训练数据。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.
