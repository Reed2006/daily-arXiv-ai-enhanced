TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题上表现脆弱，主要依赖记忆而非推理。PHANTOM RECALL基准测试显示，当谜题被轻微修改时，模型性能显著下降，出现'幻影回忆'现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板。当谜题被修改时，模型表现会如何变化。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本。评估11个领先LLM，开发自动化逻辑等价判断器和错误分类法。

Result: 在未修改谜题上准确率接近完美，但在扰动版本上表现显著低于人类水平，出现幻影回忆和过度阐述问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在语境线索变化时往往无法重新推理，揭示了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

TL;DR: LLMs作为世界模型存在幻觉和长期模拟能力不足的问题，提出的R-WoM通过检索增强机制显著提升了长期环境模拟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为世界模型可以增强智能体决策，但受限于幻觉问题和静态训练知识，在长期模拟中会产生累积误差，需要系统评估其适用性并改进。

Method: 通过三个任务评估LLMs的世界建模能力：下一状态识别、完整流程规划对齐和里程碑转换识别；提出检索增强世界模型(R-WoM)，结合外部教程知识来增强LLM模拟。

Result: LLMs能有效捕捉即时下一状态和有意义的转换，但在完整流程规划中性能迅速下降；R-WoM相比基线在OSWorld和WebArena上分别提升25.3%和18.1%，在长期模拟中优势更明显。

Conclusion: LLMs在短期世界建模中表现良好，但长期模拟可靠性有限；R-WoM通过检索增强有效解决了这些问题，显著提升了长期环境动态建模能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

### [3] [LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905)
*Patrick Haller,Mark Ibrahim,Polina Kirichenko,Levent Sagun,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs对输入变化的敏感性源于其内部知识表示的不稳定性。研究发现，当输入样本与预训练数据相似度降低时，LLMs区分真假陈述的能力会显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs性能脆弱性是否源于其内部知识表示的不稳定性，特别是当输入经历表面变换而偏离训练分布时。

Method: 通过应用语义保持的扰动（如拼写错误、重新表述）使样本偏离分布，评估四个LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法中表示可分性的退化情况。

Result: 当样本呈现与预训练数据相似度降低时，LLMs内部陈述真实性的表示会崩溃。虽然LLMs在输入与预训练数据相似时能区分真假陈述，但这种能力高度依赖陈述的确切表面形式。

Conclusion: LLMs可能学习了浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，导致泛化能力有限。这对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本挑战，并呼吁进一步研究改进学习知识表示的鲁棒性。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

### [4] [LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11919)
*Armel Zebaze,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间"思考标记"并不能提升翻译性能，包括使用人工翻译实践启发的思维链微调。但通过模块化翻译特定提示策略构建中间标记能带来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中使用中间思考标记的潜在益处，特别是在不同资源水平的语言对中。

Method: 使用思维链方法生成中间标记，包括基于人类翻译实践的蒸馏思维链微调，以及模块化翻译特定提示策略构建中间标记。

Result: 思考标记不能帮助大型推理模型更好地执行机器翻译，思维链微调不优于标准输入输出微调。但模块化提示策略构建的中间标记能带来改进。

Conclusion: 微调期间中间标记的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试。使用教师模型改进目标翻译或扩展平行语料比蒸馏思维链解释到"思考"翻译模型更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

### [5] [Discrepancy Detection at the Data Level: Toward Consistent Multilingual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928)
*Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Valérie Aldana,Karla Cantarero,Alonso Madroñal de Mesa,Jerónimo Arenas-García,Jordan Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MIND框架，用于检测多语言问答系统中的事实和文化不一致性，通过用户参与的事实核查流程来提升系统的文化意识和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言问答系统需要确保跨语言的事实一致性，特别是对于客观问题，同时还要考虑主观回答中的文化差异。

Method: 提出MIND用户参与的事实核查流程，用于检测多语言问答知识库中的事实和文化差异，特别关注文化敏感问题的分歧回答。

Result: 在母婴健康领域的双语问答系统上评估MIND，并发布了标注事实和文化不一致性的双语问题数据集。在其他领域数据集上的测试也显示MIND能可靠识别不一致性。

Conclusion: MIND框架支持开发更具文化意识和事实一致性的问答系统，能够有效识别跨语言的事实和文化不一致问题。

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

### [6] [TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944)
*Yupei Li,Philipp Borchert,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架利用代码仓库作为训练资源，通过将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数并重新组装成结构上类似形式数学语句的代码数据，来提升数学大语言模型的自动形式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化方面表现不佳，主要受限于大规模语料库的稀缺，特别是包含非正式和正式数学语句对的数据。虽然现有模型能够从自然语言指令生成代码，但代码与形式数学之间的结构和语法差异限制了有效的迁移学习。

Method: TopoAlign框架将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装这些组件，使其在结构上镜像形式数学语句，从而生成结构对齐的代码数据用于训练数学大语言模型，无需额外的人工标注。

Result: 在minif2f、Putnam和ProofNet基准测试中，TopoAlign为DeepSeek-Math带来了显著提升，BEq@10性能提高了17.77%，typecheck@10提高了68.82%。对于Herald模型，尽管没有引入新的数学知识，BEq@10和typecheck@10也分别提升了0.12%和1.09%。

Conclusion: TopoAlign框架证明，即使对于专门化模型，在结构对齐的代码数据上进行训练也是有益的，能够有效利用广泛可用的代码仓库作为数学大语言模型的训练资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

### [7] [GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11952)
*Priyanka Dey,Daniele Rosa,Wenqing Zheng,Daniel Barcklow,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAVITY是一个生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据框架，通过整合人口统计、文化和心理框架来指导个性化内容生成，减少对人类标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM个性化方法依赖昂贵的人类反馈或交互日志，限制了可扩展性且忽略了更深层的用户属性。

Method: 整合Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查和Big Five OCEAN特质等框架，生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对。

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的书籍描述评估中，相比基于提示的条件化、标准微调和朴素合成对生成方法，GRAVITY实现了超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示其输出在86%的情况下被偏好。

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能够捕捉更丰富的用户变异，减少对昂贵标注的依赖，产生更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

### [8] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956)
*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs管道，用于自动创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询的RAG基准测试，显著提高了基准测试的难度和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG基准测试很少反映多跳或超出范围问题的真实任务复杂性，这些测试往往可以通过断开推理作弊或仅需要简单事实回忆，限制了发现现有RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了第一个自动、难度可控的管道，用于创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询（CRUMQs），可适应任何语料库和领域。

Result: 在两个流行的RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验结果显示相比之前的RAG基准测试，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低了81.0%。

Conclusion: CRUMQs管道提供了一种简单的方法来增强基准测试的难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [9] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD)方法，利用预训练LLM中不同层级的特定功能，通过仅使用后层同时生成多个token来加速推理，无需额外参数或验证步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中早期、中期和后期层分别负责输入理解、任务处理和输出转换的观察，假设经过前两层处理后得到的隐藏状态已包含足够信息，可直接用后层生成多个token，避免重复遍历前两层。

Method: 提出DMTD推理范式，在有限数据集上对Qwen3-4B模型进行微调，仅使用后层同时解码多个token，不引入额外参数、辅助程序或后生成验证。

Result: 微调后的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型实现了最高2倍的加速，仅有轻微性能损失。扩展分析表明其性能有望随训练数据集增大而进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有效的多token解码方法，能够显著提升推理速度且不引入额外开销，具有很好的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

### [10] [Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967)
*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，显著减少上下文使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受限于上下文长度，需要更有效的上下文管理方法。

Method: 开发了端到端强化学习框架FoldGRPO，包含特定过程奖励来鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（Deep Research和SWE）上，折叠智能体性能匹配或超越ReAct基线，同时使用10倍更小的活动上下文，显著优于基于摘要的上下文管理模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架有效解决了LLM智能体在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，实现了更高效的上下文管理。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

### [11] [Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986)
*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出自动形式化不仅仅是翻译过程，还需要先进行猜想步骤，并创建了ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架来专门测量LLMs的猜想能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动形式化方法忽视了猜想这一关键前置步骤，导致LLMs的自动形式化性能被高估，需要专门评估和提升猜想能力。

Method: 创建ConjectureBench数据集，设计专门的评估框架和指标，提出Lean-FIRe推理时方法来改进猜想和自动形式化。

Result: 当考虑猜想因素时，GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1等基础模型的自动形式化性能被显著高估。使用Lean-FIRe方法，GPT-4.1成功端到端自动形式化了13个PutnamBench问题，DeepSeek-V3.1成功解决了7个。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但提升自动形式化性能需要将猜想作为独立任务处理，并研究如何正确将其整合到自动形式化流程中。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互式智能体评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务上下文知识（如客户画像、产品目录等）来生成更真实多样的交互，能发现更多智能体错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮交互智能体评估方法依赖人工评估，而基于模拟用户的方法通常建模通用用户，忽略了领域特定原则，无法捕捉真实用户行为。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，整合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），使模拟器能生成反映目标市场用户信息需求和期望的交互。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更真实多样，能识别出多达33%的智能体错误，表明其作为评估工具在错误发现和智能体迭代改进方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SAGE通过整合业务知识，提供了一个更有效的多轮交互智能体评估框架，能够生成更真实的用户交互并显著提升错误检测能力。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散数学逻辑等价问题的自动问题生成系统，通过形式化语言定义问题，开发线性时间生成算法，生成的问题质量和难度与教科书问题相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线教学时代抄袭问题，通过为每个学生生成独特问题来防止作弊，同时提供大量练习题资源。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两组生成规则，并开发线性时间算法来生成问题。

Result: 学生测试显示生成问题准确性与教科书问题相当；问题解决步骤分析表明难度与教科书问题相似，优于大型语言模型生成的问题。

Conclusion: 该自动问题生成系统能有效生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，在准确性和难度方面与教科书问题相当，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较神经符号系统和LLM系统在农业领域信息抽取中的表现，LLM系统在F1分数上表现更好但存在运行速度慢、控制有限等问题，神经符号系统运行更快但泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要比较不同方法的实际表现。

Method: 在农业领域（猪肉、乳制品和作物子领域）的9个访谈上，比较神经符号系统和LLM系统的信息抽取性能。

Result: LLM系统在总体F1分数（69.4 vs 52.7）和核心信息F1分数（63.0 vs 47.2）上均优于神经符号系统。

Conclusion: 两种系统各有优劣，部署NLP系统需要考虑性能、效率和控制的平衡，存在"隐性成本"。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

*Jung-Woo Shim,Yeong-Joon Ju,Ji-Hoon Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CPR框架，通过清理不良提示和生成额外任务描述来减少LLM幻觉，显著提高生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常因用户提示结构不良或模糊而生成看似合理但错误的"幻觉"事实，这损害了模型可信度

Method: 开发了Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR)框架，使用微调的小型语言模型清理不良提示并生成额外任务描述，使提示与用户意图对齐

Result: 应用CPR后，提示的胜率超过90%，显著提高了生成质量并减少了幻觉，无需外部知识

Conclusion: CPR框架能有效缓解由不良提示引起的LLM幻觉问题，提高模型输出的可靠性和质量

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多阶段提示优化框架MPR，通过系统化改进格式不良的提示来减少大语言模型的幻觉问题，在幻觉基准测试中优化后的提示胜率超过85%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在幻觉问题上仍面临挑战，而格式不良提示（歧义表述、语法错误、信息不完整）的影响尚未得到充分研究

Method: MPR框架通过多个阶段系统化改进提示，每个阶段针对特定错误（标点、拼写错误、关键词误用），使用针对这些任务微调的小型语言模型，通过迭代增强提示清晰度和自反思机制来优先处理最相关输入

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式胜率超过85%，证明其能有效减少幻觉并提高LLM输出准确性

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级且适应性强的解决方案，可增强LLM在不同领域的可靠性，并能与现有的事后幻觉缓解框架结合使用

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Motivation: 大语言模型在实际部署中存在可靠性问题，容易产生看似合理但事实错误的幻觉输出，需要不确定性量化来评估模型生成的可信度。

Method: 论文首先介绍不确定性量化的理论基础，包括认知不确定性和偶然不确定性的区分，然后系统性地对现有LLM不确定性量化方法进行分类和比较，并展示代表性方法的实证结果。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化是解决大语言模型幻觉问题的关键研究方向，论文为该领域提供了系统性的综述和未来研究方向的清晰图景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于大语言模型的提示词重写框架，通过奖励系统和迭代DPO训练来优化文本到图像生成中的用户输入提示，无需监督微调数据即可提升图像质量和对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理简单或描述不足的提示词时表现不佳，导致图像与文本对齐度、美学质量和整体效果不理想。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为提示词重写器，设计了专门的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，无需监督微调数据即可优化用户输入提示。

Result: 该方法在各种T2I模型和基准测试中一致提升了图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，且具有很好的跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且模型无关的策略，能够显著改善文本到图像生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

### [20] [Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044)
*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了分层对齐方法，针对Transformer模型的不同功能层（局部、中间、全局）进行定向DPO优化，避免了传统统一对齐带来的"对齐税"问题，显著提升了语法流畅性、事实一致性和逻辑连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐技术（如DPO）通常将模型视为单一实体，在所有层上施加统一的优化压力，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层处理不同任务（从语法到抽象推理）的功能专业化特性。

Method: 引入分层对齐方法，使用LoRA进行精确微调，对模型的不同功能块应用定向DPO：局部层（语法）、中间层（逻辑）和全局层（事实性）。在Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen1.5-7B等先进模型上进行受控实验。

Result: 局部层对齐增强了语法流畅性，全局层对齐不仅改善了事实一致性，还是提升逻辑连贯性的最有效策略，优于所有基线方法。所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中观察到的"对齐税"问题。

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，突出了从整体优化转向结构感知的精确微调在构建更先进可靠LLMs方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APCE通过基于语义相似度的输入块选择方法，在长文本摘要任务中实现内存效率提升和ContextRot缓解，仅使用50%-70%输入序列即可达到或超越全密集基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：内存占用随序列长度二次增长，以及ContextRot现象导致的性能下降。通过选择最重要的输入块来协同减少内存占用并缓解性能退化。

Method: 提出APCE方法，通过低维语义相似度匹配当前查询来选择最重要的输入块。该方法直接在输入层面操作，不依赖底层硬件或CUDA环境，具有跨部署系统的兼容性。

Result: 实证评估显示APCE在仅使用50%-70%输入序列的情况下，实现了优于或等同于全密集基线的摘要性能，同时显著提升了KV缓存和自注意力内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种上下文感知的效率解决方案，有望激发针对其他长上下文任务的类似研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不适当的建议，需要有效的安全过滤器来防止破坏性行为

Method: 在两个数据集上评估VBHSF：Verily精神健康危机数据集（1,800条模拟消息）和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集（794条精神健康相关消息），并与NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest进行比较

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出高敏感性(0.990)和特异性(0.992)，F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上敏感性0.982，准确性0.921；在所有比较中都显著优于其他两种过滤器

Conclusion: VBHSF展示了稳健、可推广的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最小化遗漏危机，这对医疗应用至关重要

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 提出了PACE方法，通过让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估其创造力，解决了数据污染和人工评估成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs的创造力是一个重要研究领域，但面临数据污染和昂贵人工评估的挑战。受人类创造力评估启发，需要开发高效可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出PACE方法，让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估其创造力，这种方法能最小化数据污染风险并提供高效评估。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena Creative Writing排名有强相关性（Spearman's ρ = 0.739, p < 0.001）。高性能LLMs达到平均人类水平，但专业人士仍优于LLMs。语言分析显示人类和LLMs都呈现关联具体性下降趋势，但人类关联模式更多样。

Conclusion: PACE是评估LLMs创造力的有效方法，LLMs在关联创造力方面接近平均人类水平，但专业人士仍具优势，人类关联模式更加多样化。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

Motivation: 多语言领域适应中知识获取机制不明确，导致在低资源环境下性能不佳，需要深入理解LLMs如何在不同语言间学习和转移领域知识。

Method: 提出AdaXEval自适应评估方法，从训练用的双语领域语料构建选择题QA数据集，通过持续训练跟踪LLMs获取领域事实的过程。

Result: 实验表明，即使在高质量双语语料训练下，跨语言知识转移仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解LLMs在多语言领域适应中的知识获取机制，以改善跨语言知识转移效果。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Method: 系统分析语音和文本表示的粗粒度和细粒度对齐特性，提出对齐路径评分量化token级对齐质量，并设计了角度投影和长度归一化等干预策略。

Result: 发现深层表示在方向（余弦相似度）上更加对齐，但在幅度（欧氏距离）上发散；表示相似度与模态差距强相关；提出的干预策略显示出改善语音输入正确性的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统分析了LSLMs中的模态差距和对齐机制，为未来优化提供了理论和方法的指导。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛应用，安全问题日益突出。多轮对话在日常交互中更为常见，但现有基准测试未能充分考虑这种情况，存在更大的安全风险。

Method: 构建了包含10,000个样本的SafeMT基准测试，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法，并提出了安全指数来评估模型安全性。同时提出了对话安全调节器来检测对话中的恶意意图。

Result: 评估了17个模型，发现随着有害对话轮次增加，成功攻击的风险显著上升，表明现有模型的安全机制不足以识别对话交互中的危险。实验表明提出的调节器比现有防护模型更有效降低多轮攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全机制存在不足，提出的对话安全调节器能有效提升模型在多轮对话中的安全性，为模型安全研究提供了重要基准和解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Credal Transformer通过引入基于证据理论的Credal注意力机制，用概率分布集合替代单一注意力向量，直接量化模型不确定性，显著减少LLM的幻觉和自信错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因Transformer的Softmax函数产生'人工确定性'而导致的幻觉问题，该问题将模糊的注意力分数压缩为单一概率分布，丢弃了各层的不确定性信息。

Method: 用Credal注意力机制(CAM)替代标准注意力，将注意力分数重新概念化为Dirichlet分布的证据质量，产生表示不确定性的'credal set'而非单一注意力向量。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入、量化模糊性，并在无法回答的问题上通过弃权显著减少自信错误。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的架构来减轻幻觉，并建立了将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中的设计范式，为更可靠的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

### [29] [Towards Inference-time Scaling for Continuous Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12167)
*Minghan Wang,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了将离散空间中的推理时间缩放技术（多样本生成结合过程/结果奖励模型重排序）应用于连续空间推理的可行性，发现虽然能生成多样推理路径，但连续思想表示缺乏关键归纳偏置，限制了PRM/ORM模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索已证实在离散文本推理中有效的推理时间缩放技术（多样本生成+PRM/ORM重排序）能否成功适应连续空间推理，使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干模型。

Method: 使用基于dropout的采样生成多样推理路径，在COCONUT连续空间推理LM上进行Pass@N分析，并通过几何属性和轨迹动态探测来识别PRM/ORM在连续空间中失效的原因。

Result: 生成多样推理路径是可行的，Pass@N分析显示存在类似离散空间的性能提升潜力，但离散空间的数据生成和PRM/ORM训练方法在连续空间中仅带来边际改进。

Conclusion: 连续推理LM的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还应明确纳入可在推理时用于区分正确与错误思想的归纳偏置，当前限制源于连续思想表示中缺乏关键归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

TL;DR: LLaDR是一个基于大语言模型的药物重定位框架，通过从LLMs提取语义丰富的生物医学实体文本表示来增强知识图谱嵌入，从而改善生物医学概念表示，在药物重定位任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了现实实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗根本不相容的机制先验，导致生物医学知识图谱表示不足。

Method: 从大语言模型提取生物医学实体的语义丰富治疗相关文本表示，并用这些表示来微调知识图谱嵌入模型，将治疗相关知识注入KGE中。

Result: 在基准测试中，LLaDR在不同场景下均达到最先进性能，阿尔茨海默病案例研究进一步证实了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过注入LLMs的治疗相关知识，显著改善了生物医学概念表示，增强了对于研究不足或复杂适应症的语义理解，在药物重定位任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大型音频语言模型中的时间偏差问题，发现模型在预测事件时间戳时存在系统性偏差，且偏差随音频长度增加而累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分探索，存在时间偏差问题。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，量化时间偏差现象，并提出时间偏差指数(TBI)来衡量预测事件时间与真实时间的系统性错位。

Result: 研究发现时间偏差(i)在数据集和模型中普遍存在，(ii)随音频长度增加而增大，在长录音中可累积达数十秒，(iii)因事件类型和位置而异。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型存在基本的时间定位限制，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

*Zeyu Yang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于LLM和DPO的语音翻译分割框架，通过偏好对齐提升分割准确性，在多个语言对上超越现有方法，改善了翻译质量和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型如SHAS虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但受限于监督学习目标，缺乏人类偏好对齐，而这对实时自然翻译至关重要。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的分割框架，通过直接偏好优化训练，使LLM能够预测更符合实时翻译需求的自然分割点。

Result: 在ACL 60/60语料库上评估，DPO调优的LLM在分割准确性上超过SHAS，在翻译质量（BLEU、COMET）和延迟（平均滞后）方面都有持续改进。

Conclusion: 偏好调优的LLM有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推进自适应、人类对齐的同步口译发展。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HALF框架，这是一个考虑伤害严重程度的LLM公平性评估框架，将9个应用领域分为三个严重等级，评估结果显示LLM在不同领域的公平性不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM公平性评估缺乏真实场景基础，且未考虑不同领域伤害严重程度的差异，如手术决策偏见与文本摘要风格偏见的危害程度不同。

Method: HALF框架通过五阶段流程，将九个应用领域组织为严重、中等、轻微三个等级，在真实应用场景中评估模型偏见并按伤害严重程度加权结果。

Result: 评估八个LLM显示：(1) LLM在不同领域公平性不一致；(2) 模型大小或性能不能保证公平性；(3) 推理模型在医疗决策支持中表现更好但在教育领域表现更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与部署准备度之间存在明显差距，需要更贴近实际部署的公平性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现微调后的大语言模型会学习到Knobe效应这种道德偏见，通过层修补分析可以定位到特定层，只需修补少数关键层就能消除这种偏见，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究微调后的大语言模型如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德判断偏见，并理解其表现机制。

Method: 在3个开源权重的大语言模型上进行层修补分析，通过将预训练模型的激活值修补到微调模型的关键层来研究偏见定位。

Result: 发现Knobe效应偏见不仅在学习过程中被习得，而且定位在特定层组中，修补预训练模型的激活值到少数关键层即可消除该效应。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位并通过针对性干预来缓解，无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DSAS（双阶段自适应锐化）方法，通过CGW模块解决"迷失在中间"问题，通过RAS模块增强长距离依赖建模，无需架构修改或额外训练参数即可提升多文档问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多文档问答任务中存在长距离依赖建模困难和"迷失在中间"问题，现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用且简单的解决方案。

Method: DSAS包含两个模块：CGW模块通过层级注意力跟踪和位置感知加权评估段落相关性；RAS模块通过抑制关键段落与无关文本之间的信息交换来增强对关键段落的关注。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，DSAS在主流LLMs（Llama、Qwen、Mistral、Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上的多文档问答任务中平均F1分数提升4.2%。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一种即插即用的解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了多文档问答中的关键挑战，并通过消融研究验证了两个模块的必要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: 提出了MedQA-Followup框架评估医疗问答中多轮对话的鲁棒性，发现LLMs在浅层扰动下表现良好，但在多轮对话中准确性大幅下降，特别是间接上下文干预比直接建议更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要针对单轮问答的理想条件，忽视了医疗咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂性，需要系统评估多轮对话的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于MedQA数据集构建MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在跨轮次答案被挑战时保持准确性），并引入间接-直接轴分离上下文框架和明确建议。

Result: 评估五个最先进LLM发现：模型在浅层扰动下表现合理，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，Claude Sonnet 4的准确性从91.2%降至13.5%。间接上下文干预通常比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLMs安全可靠部署的关键但未被充分探索的维度，需要进一步研究以确保临床部署的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Chinese ModernBERT，一个从头开始训练的中文编码器，通过优化词汇表、训练策略和架构设计，在中文NLP任务上实现了帕累托改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编码器Transformer改进主要针对英语，未能完全迁移到中文，因为中文在分词和形态学上与英语存在显著差异。

Method: 采用硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码训练、两阶段预训练（扩展上下文到8192 tokens）以及阻尼余弦学习率调度。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强中文编码器竞争，在SimCLUE上达到0.505（Pearson）/0.537（Spearman），超越Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT为中文NLP提供了可复现的解决方案，展示了在语义相似度任务上的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Motivation: 解决语料库快速扩张时手动标注成为方法瓶颈的问题，寻求可扩展的自动化标注方案。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流程：提示工程、事前评估、自动批量处理、事后验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行标注。

Result: 在60小时内标注了143,933个句子，在两个复杂标注任务上达到98%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够以最小人工干预完成大规模数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新可能，但需要考虑成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，需要开发更可信的知识驱动方法来对抗有害内容。

Method: 将反言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程，集成RAG管道，构建包含32,792个文本的知识库，涵盖联合国数字图书馆、EUR-Lex等权威来源。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上的评估显示，该框架在标准指标(JudgeLM)和人工评估中均优于标准LLM基线和竞争方法。

Conclusion: 该框架和知识库为研究可信赖的反言论生成开辟了新途径，可应用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的对齐可以揭示语言处理的计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一个词预测关系的争议性问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词汇，并比较BA和NWP所依赖的词汇特征。

Result: 发现BA和NWP依赖于大部分不同的词汇子集：NWP表现出近因和首因偏差，关注语法；而BA优先考虑语义和语篇层面信息，具有更针对性的近因效应。

Conclusion: 这项工作增进了我们对LLM与人类语言处理关系的理解，突出了BA和NWP在特征依赖上的差异，所提出的归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在不同语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家策略减少不重要token的专家数量来加速推理，同时保持重要token的完整专家以保证模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的稀疏激活机制虽然支持专家卸载策略，但受到CPU-GPU互联带宽限制。现有预取方法训练开销大，且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出混合大小专家策略：对不重要token使用一半专家加速，对重要token使用完整专家保证质量；设计专用的回退和预取机制在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上测试，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60x到1.72x的加速，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MoBiLE框架有效解决了MoE推理中的带宽瓶颈问题，通过智能的专家选择策略在保持模型质量的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在学术评审中存在偏见：系统性高评LLM生成的论文，低估包含批判性陈述的人类论文，存在语言风格偏好和对批判性陈述的厌恶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作流程中的深度整合，研究其作为评审者在学术公平性方面带来的潜在风险。

Method: 通过模拟研究：使用研究代理生成和修改论文，评审代理评估提交内容，并进行人工标注验证。

Result: 发现LLM评审与人类判断存在显著偏差：1）LLM评审系统性高评LLM撰写的论文；2）持续低估包含批判性陈述的人类论文。

Conclusion: LLM在同行评审中部署需谨慎，存在公平性风险，但LLM指导的修改能提升论文质量，对早期研究者和低质量论文有潜在价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

Motivation: 解决分词差异对语言多样性群体在人工智能访问中的公平性问题，量化大型语言模型中的计算不平等。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对200多种语言样本进行统一分词处理，收集TPS和RTC等评估指标。

Result: 拉丁文字语言分词效率高，非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言分词成本显著增加，RTC比率通常高出3-5倍。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，未来应开发考虑语言类型多样性的分词策略和自适应词汇构建方法。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划和推理框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和基于实体权重重叠的推理路径检索，解决了知识超图检索增强生成中的静态规划和非自适应执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的RAG方法存在静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对KH结构和语义的浅层使用等三大局限，限制了其在多跳问答中的有效性。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：(1)上下文感知规划模块，绘制局部KH邻域以指导结构化的推理计划生成；(2)结构化问题分解过程，将子问题组织为动态演化的有向无环图；(3)基于实体权重重叠的推理路径检索算法，优先考虑语义连贯的超边遍历。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1分数比之前的SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG高出19.73%，生成评估分数高出8.41%，并在长距离多跳推理任务中保持了强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH通过动态规划和推理框架有效克服了现有KH-RAG方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中表现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLEAR框架，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态表示来解决RAG系统中的不忠实问题，在知识冲突情况下提高上下文忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索到的上下文证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数化记忆，特别是在知识冲突情况下的机制。

Method: 提出CLEAR框架：1) 将上下文分解为细粒度的句子级知识；2) 使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；3) 引入冲突感知微调指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实度，在各种冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR通过分析LLM内部表示并针对知识冲突进行优化，有效解决了RAG系统的忠实性问题，为理解LLM如何整合外部知识提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言Wug测试评估LLM的形态学泛化能力，发现模型在新词处理上能达到人类水平准确率，但准确率模式更多受数据可用性而非语言结构复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型的真实语言能力，特别是形态学泛化能力，确定模型准确率是否接近人类水平，以及主要受语言复杂度还是训练数据量影响。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语、西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能够以人类水平的准确率对新词进行形态学泛化，但准确率模式与社区规模和数据可用性更相关，而非结构复杂度。西班牙语和英语表现优于加泰罗尼亚语和希腊语。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要受语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂度的敏感性，其表现仅表面类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的高维嵌入虽然包含丰富语义信息，但加剧了计算复杂度和存储需求，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出SMEC训练框架，包含SMRL方法减少训练梯度方差，ADS模块降低维度剪枝信息退化，S-XBM模块增强高低维嵌入间的无监督学习。

Result: 在图像、文本和多模态数据集上验证，SMEC在显著降维的同时保持性能。在BEIR数据集上，256维压缩嵌入性能优于对比方法1.1和2.7个点。

Conclusion: SMEC框架有效解决了高维嵌入的计算和存储问题，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Result: 实验显示现有检测器在个性化设置中性能显著下降，提出的预测方法与实际性能差距相关性达到85%。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了个性化文本检测的挑战，为未来研究提供了基准和方法指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Result: 两种基准方法（模型平均和多数投票）在LeWiDi任务上持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法无效。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功迁移到LeWiDi任务，作者分析了这种差距的潜在原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs在处理典型和异常实例时，如何在语用先验（输入相关）和语义先验（概念通用）之间进行权衡。

Method: 引入VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计分析VLMs的行为。

Result: 当图像与文本不一致时，概念理解能力显著下降，这种语用先验违反的影响比语义先验更强。

Conclusion: VLMs在处理个体实例时更依赖语用先验，当输入不一致时概念理解会受损。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

TL;DR: FUT是一种微调方法，教导LLMs忠实表达不确定性而不改变其答案分布，通过将模型样本与不确定性修饰语对齐来构建训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同答案，但生成的响应通常未加修饰或以不反映这种变异性的方式进行修饰，这传达了关于LLMs知识不确定状态的不忠实信息。

Method: 通过将模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'或'很可能'）对齐来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性相匹配，除了模型和一组提示外不需要监督。

Result: FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了QA准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。进一步分析显示在不同解码策略、修饰语选择和其他不确定性表达形式（如数值）方面具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FUT是教导LLMs忠实传达不确定性的一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

*Chaoxu Pang,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PARO框架，通过让LLM生成符合任务特定推理模式的rationales，无需人工标注，在patterned reasoning任务上达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的SFT+RLVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式依赖昂贵的人工rationales标注，本文旨在探索如何在不损害推理性能的前提下大幅降低rationales标注成本。

Method: 识别patterned reasoning任务类别，提出PARO框架让LLM基于推理模式自动生成rationales，仅需有限的人工模式监督。

Result: PARO生成的rationales在SFT+RLVR中达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: 大规模人工rationales标注可被仅需有限人工监督的LLM自动标注替代，显著降低标注成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

TL;DR: 本文提出了生成空间大小(GSS)的概念来解决LLM在创意任务中输出过于同质化和在事实任务中产生多样化但错误输出的问题，并开发了GSSBench评估套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在开放生成任务中存在校准问题：创意任务输出过于同质化，事实任务产生多样化但错误的响应。这两种失败模式都可以通过生成空间大小的概念来统一解决。

Method: 提出GSSBench任务套件，包含具有真实GSS关系的提示对，评估不同指标并理解模型与期望行为的差异。发现幻觉检测指标特别是EigenScore优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标。

Result: EigenScore等幻觉检测指标在仅使用模型内部信息的情况下，持续优于标准指标，为模型的内部任务表示提供可解释的见解。

Conclusion: GSS有三个应用：检测提示歧义并预测澄清问题、解释推理模型中的过度思考和思考不足、引导模型扩展生成空间以获得高质量多样化输出。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全模态语言模型在捕捉和描述细粒度细节方面能力有限，且存在细节与幻觉共增长的问题，需要系统性地提升细粒度感知能力。

Method: 1. 提出Omni-Detective代理数据生成管道，集成工具调用来自主生成高细节、低幻觉的多模态数据；2. 基于生成数据训练Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner模型；3. 设计Omni-Cloze填空式评估基准。

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上表现最佳，超越Gemini 2.5 Flash，与Gemini 2.5 Pro相当；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到新SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现细节与幻觉的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量细节描述，Omni-Cloze能稳定可靠地评估细节描述，为全模态细粒度感知提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了语言模型对类型学合理语法偏好的研究，采用广义范畴语法构建更自然的人工语言，并关注模型对未见长句的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用上下文无关的人工语言，无法覆盖自然语言中的无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构等特征。本文旨在构建更贴近自然语言的人工语言，并更关注模型对长句的泛化能力。

Method: 采用广义范畴语法(GCG)构建人工语言，覆盖无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构，并设计实验评估模型对未见长句的泛化表现。

Result: 实验表明，类型学上合理的词序更容易让语言模型实现生产性泛化。

Conclusion: 语言模型确实存在对类型学合理语法结构的归纳偏置，使用更自然的人工语言和关注泛化能力的实验范式能得出更清晰的结论。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然度具有挑战性，因为'自然度'概念多样且缺乏可扩展的定量指标。

Method: 提出DGRC方法：将对话分割为提示，使用语言模型生成子部分延续，重新组合对话和延续，比较重组序列的似然性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续对话中的核心议题内容，指令调优模型此效应更强。在相关提示下，模型会减少对核心议题的偏好。

Conclusion: DGRC方法能够减轻语言模型语言分析中的偏见，并系统测试对话敏感行为，反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论框架的语言学评论对LLMs的批评往往是推测性和非建设性的，需要转向更实证的语言学视角。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的经验主义语言学框架，将语言定义为所有口头和书面内容的总和，强调语言元素使用频率的主导地位。

Result: 基于这一框架挑战了先前对LLMs的批评，并为语言模型的设计、评估和解释提供了建设性指导。

Conclusion: 从经验主义角度重新定义语言本质，为理解和评估语言模型提供了更实用和建设性的理论基础。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个可改造的动态层路由框架，通过轻量级路由器决定跳过、执行或重复Transformer层，在保持或提高精度的同时节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有Transformer层，导致简单查询浪费计算资源，而复杂查询又缺乏深度推理的灵活性。现有自适应深度方法通常需要昂贵的推理时搜索、架构更改或大规模重训练，且在实践中往往以精度损失换取效率。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)推导高质量层配置，在计算预算下保持或提高精度。采用窗口池化稳定路由、带类别平衡的焦点损失和瓶颈MLP路由器，确保在类别不平衡和长序列下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ARC和DART任务上，Dr.LLM精度提升高达+3.4%，平均每个示例节省5层。路由器在领域外任务上泛化良好，仅损失0.85%精度，同时保持效率，比现有路由方法性能提升高达+7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明显式监督的路由器可以在不改变基础权重的情况下，为冻结的LLM提供预算感知、精度驱动的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Method: 实现多种AI策略：基于规则的启发式方法（激进、保守、平衡、机会主义）、搜索方法（MCTS、ISMCTS）和强化学习方法（DQN、PPO），通过锦标赛和冠军赛进行系统评估。

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，基于规则的激进代理获得最高胜率（88.3%），显著优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%），通过有效利用Jhyap声明获得优势。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural

Motivation: 现代应用开发者需要频繁决定是否切换到新的LLM模型，而人工评估成本高且不可扩展。现有的LLM-as-a-judge方法存在严重正向偏差问题。

Conclusion: LLM评估器存在系统性正向偏差，通过回归框架可以有效缓解这一问题，为模型选择提供更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

Motivation: 传统基因变异解释方法耗时耗力，需要自动化工具加速临床转化。现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类描述实验成果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面显示出潜力但存在明显差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解释上更优。模型即使正确分类证据也经常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优势和局限，为AI在临床遗传学和更广泛科学领域的应用开辟了新研究方向。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Method: 开发CausalTrace神经符号因果分析模块，集成到SmartPilot工业CoPilot中，利用数据驱动的因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，支持因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析，并实现实时操作员交互。

Result: 在学术火箭组装测试中，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），RCA性能优异（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92），C3AN评估得分4.59/5，展示了部署的精确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: CausalTrace成功解决了工业AI系统的黑盒问题，通过神经符号因果分析提供了透明可解释的决策支持，在制造环境中表现出高可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码合同遵循性的框架，扩展了HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，通过合同违反测试用例增强模型对合同约束的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了真实软件中合同约束的重要性，导致无法衡量模型生成代码的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: PACT提供专注于合同违反的综合测试套件，通过添加合同违反测试用例来增强提示，并引入新的指标来量化合同遵循性。

Result: 分析表明，在提示中添加合同违反测试用例相比仅使用合同描述，能显著提高模型对合同的遵循能力。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误，为评估LLM生成代码在功能和合同遵循性方面的鲁棒性提供了严格且可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种地理空间感知层(GAL)，通过整合地理数据来增强LLM代理在灾害响应中的能力，使其能够生成基于证据的资源分配建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而LLM虽然具有少样本泛化能力但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 引入GAL层，从原始野火检测开始，自动从外部地理数据库检索并整合基础设施、人口统计、地形和天气信息，组装成带单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估表明，地理空间接地的代理能够超越基线方法，该框架可泛化到洪水、飓风等其他灾害。

Conclusion: GAL通过将LLM代理与结构化地球数据接地，显著提升了灾害响应系统的性能和可解释性，为多灾害场景提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来引导模型获得更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型存在推理效率低下和偏离目标的问题，而无需训练的方法要么基于僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令基于推理行为分类学进行演化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率与推理长度的权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好，ThinkPilot提供了一个可推广的框架来使模型推理与任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [72] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口属性推断研究严重依赖带有人口标签的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性有限且在不同数据集和用户群体间泛化能力差。

Method: HiCoTraj将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，通过创建详细的活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，然后使用分层思维链推理系统引导LLM完成三个认知阶段：事实特征提取、行为模式分析和结构化输出的人口推断。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下在多个人口属性上实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了标注人口数据稀缺的挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链，提高了人口属性推断的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: 构建EmboMatrix训练场，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统实现可扩展模拟、多级奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: 训练的EmboBrain-7B模型在两个具身决策基准上超越671B的DeepSeek-R1基线9.5%，证明了交互式环境学习的力量。

Conclusion: 通过环境交互的具身学习是构建真正智能具身代理的有效途径，EmboMatrix为LLM获得具身决策能力提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，而在大规模数据集中检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常移动行为仍具挑战性。

Method: 学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置意义和时间模式；采用行为聚类感知建模机制，从正常活动构建个性化行为档案，并通过跨周期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 能够检测个体移动行为中的细微偏差，识别行为转变和偏离既定常规的情况，并发现大规模移动数据集中表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性，但LLM处理随机性的能力尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态和提示策略等因素，涵盖随机数生成、密码生成、项目洗牌等任务，并使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估质量。

Result: LLM生成的输出具有一定随机性，但性能不一致，经常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键限制，需要改进才能有效处理这类任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对属性强度的细粒度连续控制，超越了简单的方向对齐，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似优化以及对齐行为蒸馏等下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control
can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文对65个评估可解释AI(XAI)系统的用户研究进行了全面综述，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统设计目标和评估框架，并根据用户AI专业水平(新手和专家)进行了差异化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求增加。当前XAI系统评估过程过于技术化，缺乏对用户需求的关注，需要建立以人为中心的评估指南。

Method: 通过对65个XAI用户研究的全面综述分析，提出了XAI系统特性和以人为中心的评估指标分类，并针对不同AI专业水平的用户扩展了设计目标。

Result: 发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释组件构成；评估指标分为情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；为AI新手提出了负责任使用、接受度和可用性设计目标，为数据专家提出了人机协作和任务性能导向的设计目标。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了现有的XAI评估和设计框架，为XAI开发者提供了以人为中心的系统特性和评估指标的综合概述，以及针对不同用户群体的差异化设计指导。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT是一种无需人工标注的训练框架，通过从API文档自动构建合成数据集来微调LLM代理，使其能够处理目标导向的API调用任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，特别是开源模型表现不佳，而缺乏训练数据导致主要依赖零样本评估。

Method: 提出GOAT训练框架，从API文档自动构建合成数据集，在无需人工标注的情况下微调LLM代理，使其能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准测试中也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

TL;DR: MedKGEval是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮评估框架，用于评估临床大语言模型，通过知识图谱驱动的患者模拟和实时轮级评估来捕捉医疗对话的动态复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型医疗评估方法主要依赖对话记录的事后审查，无法捕捉医疗对话的动态性和上下文敏感性，以及患者不断变化的信息需求。

Method: 1. 知识图谱驱动的患者模拟机制，从精心构建的知识图谱中检索相关医学事实；2. 实时轮级评估框架，由评判代理在对话进行中评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实准确性和安全性；3. 构建包含八个最先进LLM的全面多轮基准。

Result: MedKGEval能够识别传统评估流程经常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险，展示了其在临床LLM评估中的有效性。

Conclusion: MedKGEval提供了一个新颖的多轮评估框架，能够更准确地评估临床大语言模型在真实医疗环境中的表现，且框架可扩展到其他语言和领域。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和元学习自动优化提示工程，减少人工干预，提升LLM在特定领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统提示工程依赖人工、效率低下的问题，以及现有自动方法缺乏动态策略选择和细粒度优化的局限性。

Method: 基于TensorFlow启发的模块化框架，集成元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，采用强化学习回收经验，通过梯度元学习自主探索最优提示优化路径。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了PromptFlow的有效性，能够以最少任务特定数据实现高性能。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，显著提升了LLM在特定任务上的适应能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出T³方法，通过检测和截断信念偏差过大的轨迹来改进LLM主动推理训练，提升策略优化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在主动推理中容易出现信念偏差，导致问题状态跟踪失败和重复无效动作，而强化学习训练无法正确归因关键探索步骤

Method: 开发T³方法，跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度偏差并截断训练轨迹，保留信息性前缀的信用分配

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³显著提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，性能提升达30%，同时减少约25%的rollout token

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒和可泛化LLM主动推理器的关键原则

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具如PyTorch、TensorFlow缺乏自动推理和知识获取支持，而传统AI语言如LISP、Prolog缺乏可扩展性和学习能力，需要一种统一解决方案

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则和爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，实现神经、符号和统计AI的统一表达

Result: 能够优雅实现transformer、形式推理、核机器和图形模型等关键AI形式，支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和学习能力与符号推理的可靠性和透明度，为AI的广泛应用提供了潜在基础

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统与真实世界信息环境存在严重不匹配，现实知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式等多种内容，但现有RAG框架仅限于文本处理。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体，引入双图构建来捕捉跨模态关系和文本语义，开发了结合结构知识导航和语义匹配的跨模态混合检索方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出优越性能，相比最先进方法有显著提升，特别是在长文档处理方面传统方法失败时表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: RAG-Anything建立了多模态知识访问的新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化限制，为处理异构内容提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，将AI从竞赛数学扩展到研究级数学工具，回答Terence Tao关于LLM能否帮助证明复杂渐近不等式的问题。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，其中LLM建议域分解，CAS提供公理化验证，形成符号反馈循环来验证每个子域的证明。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架成功展示了AI在专业数学研究中的潜力，超越了竞赛数学的限制，为数学家提供了有效的研究工具。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对基于大语言模型的Vibe Coding范式进行了首次系统性综述，建立了理论框架和实践分类，揭示了成功实施Vibe Coding的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，编程范式正在从代码生成辅助转向自主编码代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"这一新兴开发方法。然而，这种范式的有效性尚未得到充分探索，实证研究显示存在生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立了Vibe Coding的理论基础（约束马尔可夫决策过程），并将现有实践综合为五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 分析表明，成功的Vibe Coding不仅依赖于代理能力，更关键的是系统化的上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作开发模型。

Conclusion: 本研究为Vibe Coding这一变革性开发方法提供了首个全面系统的综述，建立了理论框架和实践分类，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证的LLM部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准数据集，基于42个真实定价政策，分为基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算两个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示LLM在较难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM具备通用能力，但在收入关键应用中仍不可靠，需要额外保障措施或领域适应。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，不相关主题通过资源竞争也能缓解回音室效应。相比数值模型，LLM智能体能更真实地模拟动态观点变化，再现新闻文本的语言特征，捕捉复杂的人类推理。

Conclusion: MTOS框架提高了模拟的解释性和系统稳定性，为多主题环境下的观点演化研究提供了有效工具，能够更好地理解和预测社交媒体中的观点动态。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的无信号交叉口决策框架，结合偏向注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，将碰撞风险转化为密集奖励信号，指导智能体做出安全高效的驾驶决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏向注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将其转化为密集奖励信号。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下证明了智能决策框架的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评估者时的判断偏见问题，涵盖11种偏见类型，发现现有LLM评估者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调会显著降低性能，并提出四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地被用于自主评估通信系统内容质量，确保这些AI"法官"的公正性至关重要，任何评估标准中的偏见都可能扭曲结果并破坏用户信任。

Method: 系统研究两种LLM评估模型在点式评分设置下的判断偏见，涵盖11种偏见类型，包括隐性和显性形式，分析偏见输入、评分标准、微调效果和任务难度的影响。

Result: 最先进的LLM评估者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给偏见样本分配较低分数；提供详细评分标准可增强鲁棒性；在偏见数据上微调会显著降低性能；评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: LLM评估者存在判断偏见风险，但通过适当措施可缓解，提出了四种策略来确保实际通信场景中AI评判的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Motivation: 为医疗对话系统提供结构化框架，将医疗算法和指南转化为临床问题，支持高效的患者访谈和医生友好的报告生成。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构，集成问题转换管道、基于层次聚类的冷启动机制、扩展-剪枝自适应分支机制、终止逻辑和自动化报告合成。

Result: 患者应用：NASA-TLX=15.6(低负荷)，SUS=86(高可用性)，QUIS=8.1/9(高满意度)；医生应用：NASA-TLX=26(中等负荷)，SUS=88.5(优秀可用性)，QUIS=8.3/9。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效集成到临床工作流中，降低认知需求，支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和小样本评估的局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

TL;DR: 本文提出了细胞状态潜在（CSL）视角，通过操作符语法组织学习过程，强调决策对齐的评估框架，以解决当前AI虚拟细胞模型在跨实验室、跨平台迁移性以及跨尺度耦合方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型虽然在单数据集验证中表现良好，但在跨实验室和平台迁移时存在限制，数据分割易受泄漏和覆盖偏差影响，且剂量、时间和组合效应尚未系统处理。跨尺度耦合受限，分子、细胞和组织水平的锚点稀疏，与科学或临床读数的对齐不一致。

Result: 该方法促成了功能空间读数的关注，如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏的分区以及透明的校准和报告，以实现可重复的同类比较。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法为AI虚拟细胞提供了更系统化的学习框架，通过决策对齐的评估和透明的实践，有望提升模型的可重复性和跨环境适用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Motivation: 用户生成评论的增长需要可解释模型提供细粒度洞察。现有基于原型的模型在粗粒度上操作，无法处理真实世界文本分类的多标签性质。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数确保子句、句子和文档级别的一致性。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实的人类对齐解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是半可解释多标签文本分类的稳健解决方案，能够捕捉重叠和冲突语义，通过自适应原型和多头注意力机制增强可解释性和对齐性。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为涌现更高级战略和社会智能的智能体提供了基础，模拟了类似生物进化的多智能体自动课程学习过程。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

TL;DR: 提出了HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含5000多个谜题，旨在测试大型推理模型在非标准逻辑游戏变体上的推理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注标准格式的谜题（如9x9数独），可能导致模型过度拟合和记忆解决方案模式，无法真正测试模型对新规则的理解和策略适应能力。

Method: 通过三个维度系统性地转换标准谜题：增加复杂度(IC)、引入不常见元素(UE)、包含无解谜题(UP)，减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 评估显示即使在其他基准上表现优异的模型在HardcoreLogic上性能显著下降，表明模型严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。增加复杂度是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了新的基准测试标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 将内存管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过端到端强化学习联合优化任务推理和内存管理，能够有效提升长视野代理任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论洞见。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能够有效提升LLM自动评判任务的准确性，通过协作推理和动态共识建模解决了简单聚合方法的局限性

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测中具有应用潜力，但方法仍存在一些局限性，为未来研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution

in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =

Motivation: 现有的JavaScript模糊测试技术使用随机选择来确定变异位置，效率不高。作者认为选择更好的变异目标适合使用具有可变臂数的组合多臂老虎机方法。

Method: 提出CLUTCH深度组合多臂老虎机，使用注意力机制处理可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，并通过Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略。

Result: 与三种最先进解决方案相比，CLUTCH将有效测试用例数量平均提高20.3%，每个测试用例的覆盖率平均提高8.9%。在可变和组合设置中，后悔值分别减少至少78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中表现出更高的效率，特别是在处理可变长度输入和动态探索方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一种允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统的方法，使用LLM模拟用户对推荐项目的判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将其集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度控制来改变推荐结果。LLM提供了解决方案，允许用户通过自然语言请求来指导推荐。

Method: 在训练时使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求对项目的批准情况，训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断，然后将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统的标准信号加权中。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集实验中，该方法在多样化请求下实现了细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法能够有效实现用户通过自然语言对推荐系统的实时控制，提升用户体验和满意度。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个基于多智能体系统的自动定理证明器，使用Lean语言，能够跨领域解决科学问题，支持自主或人机协作模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学问题需要创造性推理和严格的形式化验证，现有专业证明系统难以泛化到不同领域。

Method: 通过模型上下文协议(MCP)为大型语言模型配备Lean工具，结合LLM的知识推理能力和形式化验证工具。

Result: 在公开数学基准测试中与最先进证明器相当，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准上表现更优，并成功辅助数学家形式化复杂密码学定理证明。

Conclusion: 基于工具的智能体定理证明方法为跨领域形式化验证提供了可泛化的方法论，优于专业系统。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

### [109] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的新型框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口异质性和预后意识三个ICU决策实践的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管标准。现有方法主要关注人口异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，使用新的正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在临床上更有意义、更可信且在ICU实践中更适用。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践的三个关键要素，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: 提出GAR框架，通过对抗性训练联合优化问题生成器和求解器，实现隐式课程学习，提升数学定理证明的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定问题集的强化学习方法训练效率低，难以处理复杂问题，需要一种能动态调整问题难度的方法。

Method: GAR框架包含问题生成器和求解器，在对抗循环中共同训练，通过隐式课程学习机制使问题难度与求解器能力对齐。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR为可验证环境下的问题生成与求解协同进化建立了通用强化学习范式。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

TL;DR: Janus框架通过联合使用欧几里得和双曲图神经网络来检测节点级异常，利用对比学习目标对齐两种几何空间的嵌入，从而识别难以协调的异常节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测因多样的结构模式和特征分布而具有挑战性，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。

Method: 每个节点由原始特征和基于随机游走与度数的结构特征组成两个视图，分别嵌入到欧几里得和双曲空间。使用多图自编码器框架，结合对比学习目标作为正则化项，对齐两种几何空间的嵌入。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus始终优于浅层和深层基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合多种几何表示为识别图中微妙和复杂异常提供了鲁棒且有效的方法。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种软约束薛定谔桥问题(SCSBP)，通过用惩罚函数替代硬终端约束来解决经典薛定谔桥问题在实际实现中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题在实现中强制执行硬终端约束，导致在高维或数据稀缺情况下不稳定。为了克服这一挑战，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，形成更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。使用Doob的h变换表示、薛定谔势稳定性结果、Gamma收敛和新的不动点论证。

Result: 建立了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明随着惩罚增加，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典薛定谔桥问题。

Conclusion: 软约束桥不仅提供了第一个定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大模型上计算成本过高或精度不足，需要更实用的数据影响估计技术来支持数据选择和模型调试。

Method: 使用零阶近似方法，仅依赖训练和测试数据上的损失值以及模型检查点，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 在微调的大型语言模型上，该方法在自影响估计上达到更高精度，在训练-测试影响估计上达到相当或更好的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析，能够有效理解训练数据如何塑造模型行为。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离安全分类器的决策边界，从而同时提升输出的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了假阳性和假阴性错误。

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成过程远离分类器的决策边界。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance方法在LLM-as-a-Judge评估中同时提高了输出的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为生成模型的安全优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一个基于小波系数的扩散模型框架，用于生成高质量的时间序列数据，通过多分辨率结构和跨层注意力机制在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以再现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构，而大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 在扩散模型上直接训练小波系数，结合各分解层的专用transformer和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学等六个真实数据集上的测试表明，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过利用小波变换的多分辨率特性，有效解决了时间序列生成中的多尺度结构挑战，为稀缺的高质量时间序列数据提供了可靠的合成生成方案。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提供了基于计算预算选择回放比率的实证指导，使实践者能够以显著降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Conclusion: 虽然现有视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面有一定能力，但在解释生成方面仍需改进，需要任务特定的微调才能达到人类水平的解释质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法大多基于封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图谱中且常被忽略。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个处理正陈述，另一个处理负陈述。训练时每个模型通过破坏正样本生成负样本，并用另一个模型评分选择最可能的候选。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务中优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识集成到嵌入学习中能够显著提升预测性能，证明了负知识在知识图谱嵌入中的价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义基于后续状态期望最大值的支付函数，通过条件化变换器策略于从这些阶段博弈中导出的NashQ值来训练策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更精确的极小极大值估计，并在各种环境中一致获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持对状态转移不确定性的保守性，在对抗性环境中表现出色。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，通过自适应调整策略复杂度与任务内在维度对齐来提升强化学习的鲁棒性，避免嵌套min-max优化和过度保守策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒强化学习方法依赖计算昂贵的嵌套min-max优化，导致策略过于保守，需要更高效且不过度参数化的鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用双层优化：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，从Wasserstein球中采样动态模型；上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒强化学习提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统中需要同时捕捉个人事件和关系事件，但现有工作很少将它们一起考虑，通常将用户行为简化为单一形式化表示（序列或图）。

Method: 引入包含两种事件类型的数据集集合，提出统一的形式化方法，并通过实证研究展示模型从整合两种事件类型中获益。

Result: 实证结果表明当前方法仍有显著改进空间，整合两种事件类型对模型性能有积极影响。

Conclusion: 发布这些资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，并鼓励该方向的发展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Locaris是一个基于解码器大型语言模型的室内定位系统，将Wi-Fi接入点测量视为标记，无需预处理即可处理原始Wi-Fi遥测数据，实现校准免费的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准，且在设备、信道或部署条件变化时性能迅速下降。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号直接到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个AP测量视为标记进行处理。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在各种遥测类型上匹配或超越现有技术，仅用几百个样本即可实现亚米级精度，在缺失AP情况下保持稳健性能，支持所有可用遥测数据。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的校准免费回归模型，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能，特别适合校准不可行的大规模场景。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Motivation: 针对RestartQ-UCB算法中存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性），需要设计更智能的重启机制。

Method: 提出了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了非平稳强化学习中的重启设计缺陷，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Motivation: 研究高效可计算函数与深度神经网络表示能力之间的关系，探索计算复杂性与神经网络结构之间的理论联系。

Method: 通过将布尔电路中的每个门替换为恒定大小的神经模拟器，构建深度网络，证明如果函数在比特深度上多项式时间可计算，则存在有界扇入布尔电路计算离散化映射。

Result: 对于每个精度对(n, m_out)，存在大小和深度为poly(n+m_out)的有界扇入布尔电路计算离散化映射；通过神经模拟器替换门可得到大小/深度为poly(n+m_out)的深度网络，实现精度ε=2^{-m_out}。

Conclusion: 高效图灵可计算性保证了组合稀疏DAG表示的存在性，并可通过深度神经网络实现目标精度，这为计算理论与深度学习提供了理论桥梁。

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Motivation: 传统VAE框架使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种KL正则化机制不可靠，无法在聚合后验上强制执行目标分布。

Method: 引入可编程先验框架，基于最大均值差异(MMD)构建，允许显式塑造潜在空间，无需常见的重建权衡。

Conclusion: 该工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Method: 引入基于新型速度驱动传输成本的Y形生成流，采用次线性指数（0到1之间）的凹依赖关系，奖励联合快速质量移动。通过可扩展的神经ODE训练目标实现。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，在分布度量上优于强流基线方法，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流能够有效捕获共享结构，提高生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽视了这一特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确反映了扩散预训练的内在学习速度变化。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Conclusion: 研究结果质疑了损失函数充满局部极小值的传统观点，并为非线性离散化的几何特性及损失景观中驻点分布提供了新见解。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Conclusion: Mamba中的非线性门控机制在特征提取中起着关键作用，这是Mamba能够同时实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Motivation: 深度学习睡眠分期模型在未见受试者上泛化能力差，现有对比学习方法未能充分提取领域不变特征，需要减少领域相关信息同时保留关键时序和频谱特征。

Method: 提出MEASURE框架，通过多尺度最小充分表示学习，在多个特征层次上减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期所需的关键时序和频谱信息。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于奇异学习理论的分阶段数据归因框架，揭示了神经网络训练过程中样本间影响关系的动态变化模式，包括符号翻转和过渡期的峰值现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的数据归因方法将样本间影响视为静态，但神经网络学习具有明显的阶段性，影响模式会动态变化，需要新的理论框架来捕捉这种动态特性。

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建分阶段数据归因框架，首先在玩具模型中进行分析和实证验证，然后在语言模型中大规模展示这些现象。

Result: 验证了影响关系会发生非单调变化，包括符号翻转和过渡期的峰值，这些动态变化直接映射到模型对语义层次的渐进学习过程。

Conclusion: 神经网络学习过程中的样本影响是动态变化的，分阶段数据归因框架能够捕捉这些变化，并与模型的发育阶段对齐，为理解神经网络学习动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化解决现有方法在结构边界处的性能下降问题，在零样本设置下显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的图表示学习方法假设所有图结构都可以在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但在结构边界处会出现超过20个百分点的准确率损失，因为树结构需要双曲几何而循环模式需要球面几何。

Method: GraphShaper采用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，基于局部结构特征动态计算融合权重，自适应地整合几何属性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现7.63%的提升。

Conclusion: 几何感知的对齐框架能够尊重图结构的内在几何多样性，通过多几何专业化有效解决结构边界处的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在需要细粒度模式识别的任务上表现不佳，特别是在异配图上。通过实证和理论分析发现存在过抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩为统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地减小嵌入半径，恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时以最小计算开销保持全局感知能力。

Result: H4G在异配图上实现12.8%的零样本性能提升，在同配图上实现8.4%的提升，达到最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 半径减小能够实现忠实的多尺度表示，推动零样本图学习的进展，验证了在双曲空间中保持细粒度结构细节对最优图学习的重要性。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Motivation: 深度强化学习中，更大的模型往往由于优化病理(如可塑性损失)导致性能下降。现有动态训练方法存在三个关键局限：对所有模块应用统一策略、缺乏与架构改进的对比分析、缺少不同动态方法的系统比较。

Method: 通过跨模块和架构的全面调查，提出模块特定训练(MST)框架，结合动态稀疏训练策略(稀疏到稀疏、稠密到稀疏、稀疏到稠密)，针对编码器、评论家和行动者等不同模块采用特定训练方法。

Result: 研究发现动态稀疏训练策略提供模块特定的益处，与架构改进形成互补。MST框架在不修改算法的情况下，在多样化RL算法中展示了显著的可扩展性收益。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏训练策略与架构改进相结合，能够有效解决深度强化学习中的模型扩展问题，MST框架为RL算法的可扩展性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接整合数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的归纳偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据领域均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计领域特定的归纳偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走），这不仅需要大量工作，还可能引入副作用影响泛化能力。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型推广到任意图拓扑，直接整合数据拓扑结构。针对有向无环图实现了线性时间递归，对一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: 在语言任务上比BERT在GLUE上提升0.7分，在视觉任务上比ViT在ImageNet-1k上提升2.6%，在图基准测试中优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 验证了数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，Chimera提供了一种无需领域特定偏置的统一建模方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归训练中计算成本高的问题，特别是大规模数据集下的时间和空间复杂度挑战。

Method: 使用预处理共轭梯度法加速线性求解，利用输入数据聚类识别协方差矩阵的块对角结构并构建低秩近似，采用数值梯度优化超参数避免反向传播，利用CUDA Toolkit在GPU上并行化训练。

Conclusion: nuGPR通过数值线性代数技术和GPU并行化，有效解决了GPR训练的计算瓶颈，为大规模GPR应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Conclusion: GRACE通过解决局部结构异质性和分布不匹配问题，显著提升了图少样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但容易受到投毒攻击，并且会传播偏见。即使数据分布均匀，历史偏见也会通过模型共享传播。

Conclusion: 这种攻击隐蔽且有效，能够对抗现有的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案，突显了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Conclusion: 预算学习在生存数据分析中具有实际应用价值，能够有效利用有限预算获取更多信息来改进模型性能，同时保持与现有方法相当的计算效率。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分解为三个理论阶段，基于此提出的轻量级替代方法避免了昂贵的双层优化，实现了更稳定的性能。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

TL;DR: 提出DE3S方法解决医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和及时性冲突问题，通过双增强软形状学习框架精确识别形状特征，在六个真实医疗数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗应用中的早期时间序列分类对时间敏感场景至关重要，如ICU中的脓毒症预测，延迟预测会导致大量死亡。现有方法在准确性和及时性之间存在权衡，难以捕捉早期阶段的微弱信号和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 提出双增强软稀疏形状学习框架(DE3S)：1)结合传统时间增强和基于注意力的全局时间增强的双增强策略；2)基于注意力分数的软形状稀疏化机制；3)双路径专家混合网络和Inception模块融合架构。

Conclusion: DE3S方法通过创新的双增强软形状学习框架，有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和及时性冲突，在真实医疗场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

*Hanru Bai,Weiyang Ding,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion框架，通过Koopman算子理论将非线性扩散动态提升到线性潜空间，实现单步采样和可解释生成轨迹，解决扩散模型采样速度慢与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但迭代去噪过程导致采样速度慢。现有单步方法虽然加速推理，但牺牲了扩散动态的可解释性和精细控制能力，这些特性对于可编辑生成等应用至关重要。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动态提升到潜空间，其中演化由全局线性算子控制，实现闭式轨迹解。设计分层架构，通过尺度特定的Koopman子空间在空间分辨率上解耦生成动态，系统捕获从粗到细的细节。

Result: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion不仅实现了有竞争力的单步生成性能，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操作生成过程的原理性机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样与可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLMs虽然增强了图数据的表示能力，但容易受到结构和文本属性的对抗攻击。现有方法缺乏统一的多维度攻击框架。

Method: IMDGA使用三个紧密集成的模块，在保持可解释性的同时，协调图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上的实验表明，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了Graph-LLMs中未被充分探索的语义脆弱性维度，为提升其鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

Conclusion: MoRA的实例特定动态适应方法能有效整合分子图结构与LLM，同时保持LLM的核心知识，在分子任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 在执行性学习中，数据分布会随着部署的模型而动态变化，这与传统监督学习不同。需要同时考虑模型对当前数据的拟合效果以及模型可能引导分布变化的影响。

Method: 通过高维岭回归分析正则化在执行性学习中的作用，研究正则化参数如何应对执行性效应导致的分布漂移。

Result: 执行性效应在总体设置下会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能是有益的。最优正则化强度与执行性效应的总体强度成正比。

Conclusion: 可以通过预估执行性效应的强度来设置正则化参数，从而更好地应对执行性学习中的分布漂移问题。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for

Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法依赖显式任务标签或额外训练，且通常激活固定数量的完整LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足，影响性能。

Method: 将LoRA分解为秩一组件作为独立单元，在序列级别自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级别进一步细化路由，仅激活最相关的ROCs。

Result: 在领域泛化任务中取得显著提升，准确率比最先进基线提高高达55%，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA重用方法，通过分层路由机制实现了更好的领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Motivation: 传统物理信息极限学习机在处理包含高频和变频行为的偏微分方程时面临困难，需要改进以有效捕捉目标解的不同频率分量。

Method: 1) 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数；2) 为隐藏神经元分配频率系数集；3) 开发创新的超参数初始化方法，通过监控ELM输出权重的分布。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能进一步启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的发展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Conclusion: 该工作成功将经典SPI定理扩展到在线深度强化学习，提供了理论框架和实用算法，在保持理论保证的同时实现了竞争性性能。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑造、熵正则化、课程学习），但其理论基础尚不完善。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，并在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析，将最佳已知速率提高了log²T倍。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

Conclusion: 该工作推进了实用且隐私保护的LLM推理的可行性

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了跨模态错误检测的基准测试，评估了五种方法在四个数据集上的表现。Cleanlab和DataScope配合AutoML框架表现最佳，但现有方法在现实世界重尾数据中仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据质量保证面临挑战，传统单模态错误检测方法无法处理电商、医疗等领域中常见的跨模态错误，需要开发跨模态错误检测方法。

Method: 对四种数据集和五种基线方法进行基准测试，包括Cleanlab标签错误检测框架和DataScope数据评估方法，结合AutoML框架进行评估。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope配合AutoML框架取得了最高的F1分数，但在处理重尾现实世界数据时现有方法仍有局限性。

Conclusion: 当前跨模态错误检测方法仍不完善，特别是在处理现实世界重尾数据时表现有限，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [164] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种只需一行代码的优化器无关修改，仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新一致时应用权重衰减，相比标准解耦衰减能保持原始损失函数并搜索未修改目标的局部帕累托最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦衰减隐式优化了正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数，通过诱导滑动模式行为来搜索未修改目标的局部帕累托最优静止点。

Method: CWD是一种优化器无关的修改，仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新一致时应用权重衰减，无需新超参数或额外调优，可直接替换AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模下持续改善了最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是一种简单有效的权重衰减改进方法，能够提升模型性能而无需额外调优，适用于大规模深度学习任务。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用两种连续距离函数来评估生成式AI模型生成的无机晶体材料的独特性和新颖性，克服了传统晶体距离函数的四个主要局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估生成式AI模型生成晶体材料的距离函数存在四个主要问题：无法量化化合物间相似程度、不能区分成分差异和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估晶体材料的独特性和新颖性，这些距离函数在理论上克服了传统方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，这些新距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数遗漏的见解，为评估和比较无机晶体的生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成式AI模型在功能材料发现领域的评估提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准，特别是在应对气候变化等科学挑战方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来优化未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存场景中均优于传统强化学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，分别针对无限和有限库存场景

Result: 实验表明BO方法在收入表现上优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少假设且具有更强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了损失函数几何形状与泛化能力的关系，挑战了平坦最小值必然对应更好泛化的传统观点，发现正则化会导致更尖锐的最小值但性能更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估尖锐度在模型性能中的作用，因为近期研究发现平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系比传统认知更加复杂，存在理论反例和实证例外

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了使用不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）时的损失函数几何形状

Result: 发现正则化模型往往收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而对应更好的泛化能力、校准性、鲁棒性和功能一致性；无正则化的基线模型收敛到更平坦的最小值但性能更差

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度本身决定了解的几何形状，尖锐最小值可能反映了更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失函数几何形状进行以函数为中心的重新评估

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

TL;DR: 提出了TCVBM框架，将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模序列间依赖关系来提升视频生成任务中的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型擅长噪声到数据的生成，但在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现不佳。桥匹配模型虽然解决了数据分布间的转换问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，这在需要保持时间一致性的视频任务中是一个关键限制。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展了桥匹配方法，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接纳入采样过程。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个视频相关任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的经典方法，展现出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM通过将时间相关性整合到桥匹配框架中，有效解决了视频任务中的时间一致性挑战，为时间相关数据序列的建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CrossAD框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模进行时间序列异常检测，在多尺度建模中显式捕捉跨尺度关联，并引入全局上下文克服固定窗口限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多尺度异常检测方法独立建模各尺度或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常期间跨尺度关联的动态变化，且固定滑动窗口限制了上下文信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出跨尺度重建方法，从粗粒度序列重建细粒度序列来显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口限制。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，展示了在异常检测中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD通过显式建模跨尺度关联和跨窗口上下文，显著提升了时间序列异常检测性能，证明了多尺度动态关联建模的重要性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出了PubSub-VFL，一种基于发布/订阅架构的新型垂直联邦学习范式，通过分层异步机制解决了传统VFL计算资源利用率低和训练效率差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私问题使直接数据共享不可行。现有两方分割学习（垂直联邦学习）存在计算资源利用率低、训练效率差的问题，特别是同步依赖设计增加了训练延迟，参与者的资源和数据异构性进一步阻碍了高效计算。

Method: 利用发布/订阅架构的解耦能力和参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计了分层异步机制。基于参与者系统配置文件形式化优化问题，选择最优超参数同时保护隐私。

Result: 理论分析表明PubSub-VFL实现稳定收敛且兼容差分隐私等安全协议。在五个基准数据集上的案例研究验证其有效性，相比最先进基线，训练速度提升2-7倍且不损失精度，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了垂直联邦学习中的效率和资源利用问题，为安全高效的跨组织数据协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型普遍存在噪声偏移问题，这种系统偏差导致次优生成结果，包括分布外泛化问题和去噪更新不准确。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，显式引导采样轨迹与预定义噪声调度保持一致；并引入无分类器变体，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和无噪声条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中长期被忽视但普遍存在的问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能显著改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Conclusion: 本文旨在为因果发现的合理评估提供标准，并进一步促进其在现实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要公平收入分配的问题，其中上下文变化是固有特征。跨上下文的最小奖励约束聚合虽然能提高性能和可行性，但带来了技术挑战，特别是缺乏标准MAB设置中通常可用的闭式最优分配。

Method: 设计并分析两种算法：乐观优先性能算法和悲观强制约束满足算法。针对每种算法推导了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界。

Result: 建立了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界，并证明时间范围依赖在一般情况下是最优的，揭示了先前工作中利用的自由探索原则的基本局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有跨上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，并建立了理论保证，揭示了此类问题的基本限制。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练基础推理模型(FIMs)的解耦方法，用于发现高维动力系统的低维有效变量和拟合控制方程，通过冻结FIM权重实现稳定表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维动力系统通常具有低维流形结构，传统方法需要同时学习粗粒度变量和动力学方程，这导致训练不稳定。

Method: 利用预训练的FIMs解耦两个问题：冻结FIM权重推断动力学，仅训练编码器-解码器映射，定义简单的模拟一致性损失。

Result: 在嵌入合成视频数据的随机双井系统上验证了该方法，展示了快速可重用粗粒度管道的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦表示学习和动力学推断，实现了更稳定高效的粗粒度建模。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合思维LLMs仅实现了部分模式分离，推理行为经常泄露到无思维模式中，需要理解和缓解这一问题。

Method: 识别影响可控性的四个关键因素，并提出两阶段训练策略：先训练推理能力，然后应用混合思维训练。

Result: 与标准训练相比，新方法能在保持两种模式准确性的同时，显著减少无思维模式输出长度（从1085降至585）和推理支持令牌出现次数（从5917降至522）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前混合思维的局限性，并为加强其可控性提供了方向。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主动特征获取方法局限于单一任务、缺乏可扩展性的问题，利用回顾性数据中的系统性缺失特征和有限标签来学习跨任务的特征获取策略。

Method: L2M包含两个核心组件：1）对未见任务的可靠不确定性量化；2）基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，最大化条件互信息。采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法处理任意缺失模式。

Result: 在合成和真实世界表格基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越了任务特定基线方法，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上运行，无需针对每个任务重新训练，实现了跨任务的元主动特征获取，提高了方法的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在扩展到大规模集群时，由于RL轨迹生成的极端长尾偏斜导致严重的GPU利用率不足。全局权重同步机制不适应RL训练中高度偏斜且不断演化的轨迹生成延迟分布，限制了训练效率。

Method: 1. 用中继工作者层级替代全局更新，实现分布式参数服务，支持异步细粒度权重同步；2. 动态重打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上，最大化生成吞吐量；3. 完全解耦设计隔离故障，确保长时间作业的鲁棒性。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了最高5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: 通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，Laminar能够有效解决大规模RL后训练中的可扩展性问题，显著提升训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了贝尔曼-瓦瑟斯坦距离(BWD)，一种无需训练智能体就能评估离线强化学习数据集质量的方法，并能作为正则化器提升策略优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习的数据集质量差异很大，但事先难以评估数据集质量，因为不知道数据的来源和技能组成。需要一种无需训练智能体就能估计数据集质量的方法。

Method: 研究了从简单累积奖励到基于学习价值的估计器的一系列代理指标，引入了贝尔曼-瓦瑟斯坦距离(BWD)，这是一种价值感知的最优传输得分，通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与聚合多个离线RL算法的oracle性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器能显式推动学习策略远离随机行为并提高回报。

Conclusion: 像BWD这样的价值感知、分布信号是筛选离线RL数据集和策略优化的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Motivation: 现有的表格数据深度学习方法在处理特征交互和噪声方面存在不足，需要一种能够同时建模原始特征和目标条件表示、并能自适应过滤噪声的鲁棒框架。

Method: 使用双流编码器分解特征为原始值和目标条件流，通过跨维度自注意力捕获流内特征依赖，跨编码自注意力实现双向交互，自适应稀疏自注意力机制动态抑制低效用标记。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中相比强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升，验证了联合建模原始和目标条件视图并自适应过滤噪声的有效性。

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应稀疏机制，成功构建了一个更鲁棒的深度表格学习器，在表格数据监督学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Motivation: 扩散模型在高维逆问题中表现优异，但仅能从损坏或噪声观测中学习仍然具有挑战性。

Method: DiffEM方法结合条件扩散模型和EM算法：E步使用条件扩散模型从观测重建干净数据，M步用重建数据优化条件扩散模型。

Result: 理论证明DiffEM迭代具有单调收敛性，实验在多种图像重建任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DiffEM为从损坏数据训练扩散模型提供了有效解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Motivation: 探索ReLU神经网络激活模式的拓扑特征，理解网络在特征空间中的结构分解如何反映其决策行为，特别是在分类和回归任务中的表现。

Method: 分析前馈ReLU神经网络在特征空间中诱导的多面体分解，研究其对偶图的Fiedler分割，并计算细胞分解的同调群。

Result: 在二分类任务中，Fiedler分割与决策边界存在相关性；在回归任务中，训练损失与多面体单元数量在训练过程中表现出相似的行为模式。

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Motivation: 化学预训练模型在药物发现中具有重要应用潜力，多任务学习已被证明能改进预测模型，但多任务微调对化学预训练模型的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用KERMT（GROVER模型的增强版）和KGPT等化学预训练图神经网络模型进行多任务微调，并与非预训练模型对比。

Result: 多任务微调显著提高了化学预训练模型的性能，特别是在大数据量下KERMT的性能提升最为显著。

Conclusion: 多任务微调是提升化学预训练模型在药物发现中预测性能的有效策略，特别是在大数据场景下效果更佳。

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，无需专用硬件支持低比特存储。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的词嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求和内存占用过高，特别是在边缘设备上内存受限，压缩嵌入层可释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 使用线性和非线性映射的组合，通过校正适配器和分组残差向量量化来模拟原始模型嵌入，实现高效压缩。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特数/参数，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确性，相比标量化表现更好。

Conclusion: CARVQ是与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的新型压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，为LLM在边缘设备上的高效部署迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了决策树学习中的局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值或交换特征）对分类错误最小化的影响，发现这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂度分析确定了使问题可处理的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂度的系统分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，确定哪些问题特性导致计算困难，哪些使问题可解。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度分析方法，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数。提出了一个时间复杂度为(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)的算法，并进行了概念验证实现和实证评估。

Result: 发现当特征数量d或域大小D单独较小时问题仍然困难，但两者组合时问题变得固定参数可解。算法在理论上可行，实证结果验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析确定了决策树局部搜索操作的计算复杂度特性，为实际应用提供了理论指导，证明了在特定参数组合下问题可有效求解。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Motivation: 解决农业环境中异构农场数据和隐私敏感数据的问题，同时实现作物特定模型的本地专业化与跨作物知识的全局集成。

Method: 采用三层分层架构：客户端智能农场、作物特定聚合器、全局模型聚合器，结合季节性订阅机制让农场在每个农业季节开始时加入作物特定集群。

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习架构在涉及异构农业环境和隐私敏感农业数据的场景中具有显著优势，能够有效平衡本地专业化与全局泛化需求。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

TL;DR: UNIVERSE方法通过使用Rashomon集合（近似最优模型集合）来估计变量重要性，即使在存在未观测特征的情况下也能提供真实变量重要性的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测到的特征，但变量重要性受模型中包含的其他变量影响，且重要变量常被遗漏。此外，不同模型可能给出不同的变量重要性估计（Rashomon效应）。

Method: 引入UNIVERSE方法，通过构建Rashomon集合（数据集中近似最优模型的集合）来估计变量重要性，并处理未观测特征的问题。

Result: 该方法在理论上具有鲁棒性保证，在半合成模拟中表现良好，并在信用风险任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE提供了一种稳健的方法来估计变量重要性，能够处理模型不确定性和未观测特征的问题。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗攻击的威胁，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险，需要开发无需模型修改的轻量级检测方案。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补指标，当两个指标的类别预测不一致时判定为对抗样本，仅需在预训练编码器上进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10上达到0.94精度和0.81召回率，在CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上达到0.66精度和0.85召回率，定理条件满足时能持续有效检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: KoALA是一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，为对抗防御提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何构建概率预测器，使其在下游用户决策时能产生准确决策。针对多个决策者，提出了比现有方法更高效的omniprediction算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有omniprediction方法存在局限性：基于多校准的方法样本复杂度不最优，基于对抗游戏的方法会产生复杂随机化预测器。需要设计更直接高效的算法。

Method: 提出了新的非随机化算法，利用proper loss集合的结构特性，避免在线到批处理的转换，直接构建高效预测器。

Result: 证明多校准比omniprediction更难，前者样本复杂度不最优。新算法改进了对抗游戏方法，避免了复杂随机化预测器。

Conclusion: 通过利用proper loss的结构特性，可以设计出更直接、非随机化的高效omniprediction算法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Motivation: 传统算法公平性定义关注人口统计层面的指标，但在许多社会或经济背景下，公平性是通过个体的同伴网络和比较来局部感知的。

Method: 提出了感知公平网络的理论模型，将网络结构、局部观察和社会感知联系起来，通过分析和模拟研究网络拓扑如何影响客观公平与感知公平之间的差异。

Conclusion: 网络拓扑结构显著影响客观公平与感知公平之间的差异，这对算法治理以及在金融和协作保险等领域的应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: The usual definitions of algorithmic fairness focus on population-level
statistics, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity. However, in many
social or economic contexts, fairness is not perceived globally, but locally,
through an individual's peer network and comparisons. We propose a theoretical
model of perceived fairness networks, in which each individual's sense of
discrimination depends on the local topology of interactions. We show that even
if a decision rule satisfies standard criteria of fairness, perceived
discrimination can persist or even increase in the presence of homophily or
assortative mixing. We propose a formalism for the concept of fairness
perception, linking network structure, local observation, and social
perception. Analytical and simulation results highlight how network topology
affects the divergence between objective fairness and perceived fairness, with
implications for algorithmic governance and applications in finance and
collaborative insurance.

Method: 采用博弈论分析方法，研究生产者和消费者之间的战略互动，分析供应链中各方的行为动机和决策过程。

Conclusion: 政府监管在实现供应链参与者之间的信任和信息交换方面发挥决定性作用，这最终决定了有机食品行业的发展轨迹。

Abstract: As people become more conscious of their health and the environment, the
demand for organic food is expected to increase. However, distinguishing
organic products from conventionally produced ones can be hard, creating a
problem where producers may have the incentive to label their conventional
products as organic to sell them at a higher price. Game theory can help to
analyze the strategic interactions between producers and consumers in order to
help consumers verifying these claims. Through a game theory analysis approach,
this paper provides evidence of the need for a third party to equalize markets
and foster trust in organic supply chains. Therefore, government regulation,
including regular and random monitoring and certification requirements, plays a
crucial role in achieving the desired level of trust and information exchange
among supply chain agents, which ultimately determines the growth trajectory of
the sector.

Conclusion: 论文建立了不完全信息博弈中效率的通用特征，证明了行动随机化与效率之间的基本权衡，并将结果应用于多种通信和机制设计场景。

Abstract: We study games with incomplete information and characterize when a feasible
outcome is Pareto efficient. We show that any outcome with excessive
randomization over actions is inefficient. Generically, efficiency requires
that the total number of actions taken across states be strictly less than the
sum of the number of players and states. We then examine the efficiency of
equilibrium outcomes in communication models. Generically, a cheap talk outcome
is efficient only if it is pure. When the sender's payoff is state-independent,
it is efficient if and only if the sender's most preferred action is chosen
with certainty. In natural buyer-seller settings, Bayesian persuasion outcomes
are inefficient across a wide range of priors and preferences. Finally, we show
that our results apply to mechanism design problems with many players.

Conclusion: 竞争促使企业采用最准确但最难的测试，产生精确但无用的学习结果。还考虑了产能约束、工资报价和非对称均衡情况。

Abstract: Two identical firms compete to attract and hire from a pool of candidates of
unknown productivity. Firms simultaneously post a selection procedure which
consists of a test and an acceptance probability for each test outcome. After
observing the firms' selection procedures, each candidate can apply to one of
them. Both firms have access to a limited set of feasible tests. The firms face
two key considerations when choosing their selection procedure: the statistical
properties of their test and the selection into the procedure by the
candidates. I identify two partial orders on tests that are useful to
characterise the equilibrium of this game: the test's accuracy (Lehmann, 1988)
and difficulty. I show that in any symmetric equilibrium, the test chosen must
be maximal in the accuracy order and minimal in the difficulty order.
Intuitively, competition leads to maximal but misguided learning: firms end up
having precise knowledge that is not payoff relevant. I also consider the cases
where firms face capacity constraints, have the possibility of making a wage
offer and the existence of asymmetric equilibria where one firm is more
selective than another.

Abstract: This paper studies variance estimators in panel data settings. There has been
a recent surge in research on panel data models with a number of new estimators
proposed. However, there has been less attention paid to the quantification of
the precision of these estimators. Of the variance estimators that have been
proposed, their relative merits are not well understood. In this paper we
develop a common framework for comparing some of the proposed variance
estimators for generic point estimators. We reinterpret three commonly used
approaches as targeting different conditional variances under an
exchangeability assumption. We find that the estimators we consider are all
valid on average, but that their performance in terms of power differs
substantially depending on the heteroskedasticity structure of the data.
Building on these insights, we propose a new variance estimator that flexibly
accounts for heteroskedasticity in both the unit and time dimensions, and
delivers superior statistical power in realistic panel data settings.

Abstract: We leverage an ensemble of many regressors, the number of which can exceed
the sample size, for economic prediction. An underlying latent factor structure
implies a dense regression model with highly correlated covariates. We propose
the L2-relaxation method for estimating the regression coefficients and
extrapolating the out-of-sample (OOS) outcomes. This framework can be applied
to policy evaluation using the panel data approach (PDA), where we further
establish inference for the average treatment effect. In addition, we extend
the traditional single unit setting in PDA to allow for many treated units with
a short post-treatment period. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our
approach exhibits excellent finite sample performance for both OOS prediction
and policy evaluation. We illustrate our method with two empirical examples:
(i) predicting China's producer price index growth rate and evaluating the
effect of real estate regulations, and (ii) estimating the impact of Brexit on

### [205] [Optimal break tests for large linear time series models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12262)
*Abhimanyu Gupta,Myung Hwan Seo*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发了一类用于检测无限阶和增长阶时间序列回归模型中未知时间点结构断点的最优检验方法，包括AR(∞)、协变量递增的线性回归和非参数回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高维时间序列回归模型中的结构断点检测时面临挑战，特别是在零假设下存在识别失败的情况，需要开发能够处理增长维度的最优检验方法。

Method: 在辅助i.i.d.高斯误差假设下推导平均功效最优检验，建立增长维度版本的Andrews和Ploberger指数检验；放松假设后建立基础随机过程的功能中心极限定理，并针对高阶序列依赖项和有限样本偏差进行稳健化处理。

Result: 建立了处理增长维度中识别失败的最优检验框架，证明了功能中心极限定理的存在，并通过蒙特卡洛研究和实证示例展示了方法的优异性能。

Conclusion: 提出的检验方法在理论和实证上都表现出色，能够有效检测高维时间序列回归模型中的结构断点，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We develop a class of optimal tests for a structural break occurring at an
unknown date in infinite and growing-order time series regression models, such
as AR($\infty$), linear regression with increasingly many covariates, and
nonparametric regression. Under an auxiliary i.i.d. Gaussian error assumption,
we derive an average power optimal test, establishing a growing-dimensional
analog of the exponential tests of Andrews and Ploberger (1994) to handle
identification failure under the null hypothesis of no break. Relaxing the
i.i.d. Gaussian assumption to a more general dependence structure, we establish
a functional central limit theorem for the underlying stochastic processes,
which features an extra high-order serial dependence term due to the growing
dimension. We robustify our test both against this term and finite sample bias
and illustrate its excellent performance and practical relevance in a Monte
Carlo study and a real data empirical example.

### [206] [Nonparametric Identification and Estimation of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from 42 Million Pollution Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12289)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发了一个非参数框架来识别和估计地理溢出效应中的空间边界，使用4200万卫星观测数据发现非参数核回归比参数化指数衰减假设平均减少1.0个百分点的预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气扩散理论预测的理想化指数衰减假设（稳定风、均匀大气、平坦地形）在实践中经常被违反，需要更灵活的方法来准确估计污染物的空间边界。

Method: 建立了在弱平滑性和单调性条件下的非参数空间边界识别，提出了基于核的估计器与数据驱动的带宽选择，并推导了渐近理论进行推断。

Result: 非参数方法在政策相关距离上表现最佳：10公里处减少2.8个百分点误差（近源影响），100公里处减少3.7个百分点误差（长距离传输）。参数方法系统性地低估近源浓度而高估长距离衰减。

Conclusion: 灵活的数据驱动空间方法在环境政策应用中显著优于限制性参数假设，COVID-19自然实验验证了框架的时间敏感性。

Abstract: This paper develops a nonparametric framework for identifying and estimating
spatial boundaries of treatment effects in settings with geographic spillovers.
While atmospheric dispersion theory predicts exponential decay of pollution
under idealized assumptions, these assumptions -- steady winds, homogeneous
atmospheres, flat terrain -- are systematically violated in practice. I
establish nonparametric identification of spatial boundaries under weak
smoothness and monotonicity conditions, propose a kernel-based estimator with
data-driven bandwidth selection, and derive asymptotic theory for inference.
Using 42 million satellite observations of NO$_2$ concentrations near coal
plants (2019-2021), I find that nonparametric kernel regression reduces
prediction errors by 1.0 percentage point on average compared to parametric
exponential decay assumptions, with largest improvements at policy-relevant
distances: 2.8 percentage points at 10 km (near-source impacts) and 3.7
percentage points at 100 km (long-range transport). Parametric methods
systematically underestimate near-source concentrations while overestimating
long-range decay. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural experiment
validating the framework's temporal sensitivity: NO$_2$ concentrations dropped
4.6\% in 2020, then recovered 5.7\% in 2021. These results demonstrate that
flexible, data-driven spatial methods substantially outperform restrictive
parametric assumptions in environmental policy applications.

### [207] [Beyond Test Scores: How Academic Rank Shapes Long-Term Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11973)
*Emilia Del Bono,Angus Holford,Tommaso Sartori*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究使用1962年苏格兰阿伯丁所有小学生的数据，分析学术排名对学业表现、非认知发展、父母投资和长期结果的影响。发现更高排名能提升考试成绩和自信心，长期来看对女孩的教育成就影响更大，但对男孩的收入提升更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究学术排名对学生发展的因果影响，特别是排名如何通过自我认知机制影响短期和长期结果，以及性别差异在长期影响中的表现。

Method: 利用同伴群体构成的准随机变异，估计排名对学业表现、非认知发展、父母投资和长期结果的因果影响，并使用40年后的追踪调查数据。

Result: 更高排名显著提升高风险考试（十一加考试）成绩，增强内化技能（自我概念和自信相关特质）。长期来看，排名提高教育成就（特别是女孩），但收入增长仅出现在男孩中。

Conclusion: 排名效应主要通过学生的自我认知机制运作，长期影响的性别差异反映了当时女性在高等教育和技能就业方面的历史障碍。

Abstract: We study the effects of academic rank using data on the entire population of
children enrolled in primary schools in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1962. Exploiting
quasi-random variation in peer group composition, we estimate the causal impact
of rank on academic performance, noncognitive development, parental investment,
and long-term outcomes. Higher rank improves achievement on the high-stakes
eleven-plus examination and strengthens internalizing skills (traits related to
self-concept and confidence), suggesting that rank effects operate primarily
through students' self-perception. Using a follow-up survey conducted forty
years later, we find that rank raises educational attainment, particularly for
girls, while long-term income gains emerge only among boys. The gender gap in
long-run effects likely reflects historical barriers to women's access to
higher education and skilled employment during this period.

### [208] [Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12049)
*Lu Fang,Zhe Yuan,Kaifu Zhang,Dante Donati,Miklos Sarvary*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 通过大规模随机实验验证生成式AI对在线零售平台生产力的影响，发现GenAI能显著提升销售额0-16.3%，主要通过提高转化率实现，对小商家和新用户效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化生成式AI对企业生产力的实际影响，填补大规模因果证据的空白，评估GenAI在商业应用中的早期价值。

Method: 在跨境在线零售平台进行大规模随机现场实验，涉及数百万用户和产品，将GenAI集成到7个面向消费者的业务流程中，持续6个月。

Result: GenAI采用显著增加销售额，效果范围0-16.3%，在4个有效应用中每年为每位消费者创造约5美元增量价值，主要通过提高转化率实现，小商家和新用户获益更大。

Conclusion: GenAI能显著提升在线零售生产力，具有重要的经济价值和发展潜力，特别是在减少市场摩擦和改善用户体验方面。

Abstract: We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm
productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments
involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online
retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were
integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI
adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from 0\%
to 16.3\%, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm
practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental
arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements.
Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual
incremental value is approximately \$5 per consumer-an economically meaningful
impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The
primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with
GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience.
We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well
as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our
findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects
of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader
potential.
