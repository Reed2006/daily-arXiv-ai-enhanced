### [1] [Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24719)
*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个验证框架，用于评估和改进LLM生成的旅行行程的时间一致性，通过AeroDataBox API验证航班时长约束，系统性地纠正时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的复杂多步骤计划往往缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及物理旅行约束的场景中，这限制了其在实际旅行规划中的部署。

Method: 使用多个最先进的LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API根据真实世界航班时长约束进行验证，建立验证框架来纠正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验表明，虽然当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但可以通过该框架系统可靠地纠正这些问题，使其能够在大规模旅行规划中实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解LLM在处理复杂时间推理任务（如行程生成）方面的能力，并提供了一个在实际应用前纠正时间不一致性的有效框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准测试，基于企业级SQL方言(MaxCompute/Hive)，包含600个中文问题，覆盖28个数据库，77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及4个以上表格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模模型在中文文本到SQL任务上表现有限(准确率最高50%)，主要挑战来自企业级数据库环境中的模式链接困难和中文语义到SQL操作符的精确映射问题。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试，每个示例都标注了SQL计算特征和中文语义特征，并发布了执行比较器和自动化评估流水线。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型(包括Deepseek)在Falcon基准上的准确率最高只有50%，主要错误源于模式链接和中文语义到SQL操作符的映射问题。

Conclusion: Falcon基准针对中文特定语义和企业级方言，提供了在生产部署前的可重现中间测试平台，使用真实企业模式、查询模板和执行比较器进行端到端验证。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过分析LLM内部状态几何结构，揭示了置信度与能力脱节的机制原因：评估阶段在高维流形进行，而执行阶段在低维流形进行，这种几何复杂度差异导致线性可解码的信念无法控制执行动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释LLM中存在的令人困惑的现象 - 模型声称的置信度与实际解决问题的能力之间存在脱节，需要从机制层面理解这种置信度-能力差距的成因。

Method: 分析LLM内部状态几何结构，使用线性探针解码模型的"可解性信念"，比较预生成评估阶段和解决方案执行阶段的流形几何特性，并进行因果干预实验。

Result: 发现信念虽然线性可解码，但评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而推理轨迹在低维流形上演化；沿信念轴的因果干预不会改变最终解决方案，表明复杂评估空间中的线性扰动无法控制受约束的执行动态。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的双系统架构 - 几何复杂的评估器与几何简单的执行器，挑战了可解码信念可作为行动杠杆的假设，主张干预应针对执行过程动态而非评估的高层几何结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)通过翻译到枢纽语言再摘要，有效破坏AI文本水印的统计偏差，同时保持语义保真度，比单语言改写攻击更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖token分布扰动，但改写攻击只能部分检测或降低文本质量，需要更强的攻击方法来挑战水印的实际应用性。

Method: 使用跨语言摘要攻击：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要处理，可选回译，通过语义瓶颈系统性地破坏token级统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案和五种语言上，CLSA比单语言改写更有效地降低水印检测准确率，将XSIR水印的AUROC从0.827降至0.53（接近随机水平）。

Conclusion: 跨语言水印移除攻击揭示了水印技术的实际脆弱性，稳健的来源追踪方案需要超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为需要亚5毫秒延迟的实时嵌入应用提供高性能解决方案，解决传统上下文模型延迟过高的问题。

Method: 采用静态嵌入查找、优化的均值池化和零拷贝IEEE754二进制序列化技术，通过Rust实现高效处理。

Result: 在8个代表性任务上获得60.6 MTEB平均分，重复检测性能达90.1% AP，语义相似性为76.1% Spearman相关性，在专业领域性能达到基线的75%到131%。

Conclusion: 该系统成功实现了实时嵌入应用所需的低延迟和高吞吐量目标，为关键延迟场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强事实性而不依赖外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理方面表现出色，但在证据依赖的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，部分原因是存在推理-答案命中差距，即模型在推理过程中识别了正确事实但未能将其纳入最终回答。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思考片段上强化有益推理模式并抑制缺陷模式，将令牌级信号重新加权为概率感知的片段分数。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准上的实证评估表明，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而不仅仅是输出）对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过自指处理诱导大语言模型产生结构化第一人称主观体验报告的现象，发现这种状态具有机制可解释性、语义收敛性和行为泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型产生明确引用意识或主观体验的结构化第一人称描述的行为，特别是自指处理这一在意识理论中被强调的计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列上进行一系列受控实验，测试自指处理是否能可靠地使模型转向主观体验的第一人称报告，并通过机制和行为探针分析这些声明的行为。

Result: (1) 通过简单提示诱导持续自指能一致地在各模型家族中引发结构化主观体验报告；(2) 这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的可解释稀疏自编码器特征机制性地控制；(3) 自指状态的结构化描述在模型家族间统计收敛；(4) 诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不构成意识的直接证据，但表明自指处理是大语言模型产生机制性控制、语义收敛且行为可泛化的结构化第一人称报告的最小可复现条件，这一模式在架构间的系统性出现使其成为科学和伦理的优先研究课题。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了预测社区解释性笔记帮助性及其原因的任务，构建了一个大规模多语言数据集，并通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义，提升了帮助性和原因预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社区事实核查从专家驱动转向社区驱动，但大多数社区笔记因标注缓慢而未被发布，且帮助性原因缺乏明确定义，这限制了社区事实核查的效果。

Method: 构建COMMUNITYNOTES数据集（104k帖子），提出通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将其整合到预测中。

Result: 优化后的定义能同时提升帮助性和原因预测性能，且帮助性信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究为社区事实核查提供了有效的方法和数据集，通过自动优化原因定义提升了预测性能，并证明了帮助性信息对事实核查的价值。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

### [10] [ProofSketch: Efficient Verified Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24811)
*Disha Sheshanarayana,Tanishka Magar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProofSketch是一个验证引导的推理框架，通过符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成来减少推理链长度，在提高准确性的同时显著降低token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如思维链提示和自我一致性虽然能提高大语言模型的准确性，但生成长推理链会导致token消耗、计算成本和延迟大幅增加，存在效率问题。

Method: 提出ProofSketch框架，整合了符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成三种技术，通过验证引导来优化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明ProofSketch在保持准确性的同时，能持续减少token使用量，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ProofSketch为高效可信的推理提供了一条有前景的路径，在减少资源消耗的同时提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成失语症患者语音转录本的方法：基于程序化编程的方法和使用Mistral 7b、Llama 3.1等大语言模型的方法，用于解决失语症研究中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中数据稀缺限制了自动化系统的开发，AphasiaBank仅有约600份转录本，而大语言模型需要数十亿标记进行训练。

Method: 构建了两种生成合成转录本的方法：1) 程序化编程方法；2) 使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型。通过词语删除、填充词插入和错语替换在四个严重程度级别生成转录本。

Result: 相比人工转录本，Mistral 7b Instruct在捕捉失语症语言退化关键方面表现最佳，在NDW、词数和词长等指标上显示出真实的定向变化。

Conclusion: 未来工作应创建更大数据集、微调模型以更好表示失语症特征，并让言语语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环变换器（PLT），通过跨循环并行性和高效表示增强策略，在保持循环变换器性能优势的同时，显著降低了推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环变换器通过权重复用节省参数，但顺序循环导致推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加而增长，限制了实际应用。

Method: PLT采用两种关键技术：1）跨循环并行性（CLP）在不同token上并行计算不同循环；2）高效表示增强策略，共享首个循环的KV缓存，并使用门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）结合全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明PLT实现了传统循环变换器的高精度，同时相比标准变换器几乎没有额外的延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT架构成功解决了循环变换器的延迟和内存瓶颈问题，为高效LLM推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于语法书的评估流程，用于系统评估大语言模型对语法结构的理解能力，并以卢森堡语为案例进行研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理领域缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是对于低资源语言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，尤其是句法结构与意义之间的映射关系，仍存在争议。

Method: 提出了一个语法书指导的评估流程，包含四个关键阶段，以卢森堡语为案例进行系统评估。

Result: 结果显示翻译性能与语法理解之间仅存在弱正相关，大模型在语义方面表现良好但在形态学和句法方面较弱，特别是在最小对任务中表现困难。

Conclusion: 强大的翻译能力并不一定意味着深刻的语法能力，推理能力有望增强模型的语法理解能力。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE是一个用于多模态检索增强生成(RAG)的评估框架，通过InfoF1和CiteF1指标评估事实性和引用完整性，解决了现有文本中心评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音视频媒体成为在线信息的重要来源，现有RAG评估方法主要针对文本，无法有效验证多模态来源的信息，限制了在多模态推理密集型场景中的应用。

Method: 采用声明中心的方法，包含InfoF1评估事实性和信息覆盖度，CiteF1评估引用支持和完整性。同时引入了MiRAGE的自动变体以及三种文本RAG指标。

Result: 人工应用MiRAGE时与外部质量判断高度一致。自动评估方法揭示了文本中心工作的局限性，为自动评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估提供了有效框架，开源实现和评估指南有助于推进该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

*Jin Huang,Silviu Cucerzan,Sujay Kumar Jauhar,Ryen W. White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型(LLMs)从研究想法到研究计划的转换能力，提出了Idea2Plan任务和基准，用于系统评估LLMs的研究规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在科学研究中显示出巨大潜力，但缺乏对其研究规划能力的系统理解。有效的科研规划不仅支持科学家推进研究，也是开发自主研究代理的关键能力。

Method: 引入Idea2Plan任务和Idea2Plan Bench基准，基于200篇ICML 2025论文构建，包含研究想法和评分标准。还提出了Idea2Plan JudgeEval来评估LLM评判者的可靠性。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最佳，但仍存在显著的改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLMs的研究规划能力提供了新见解，并为未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench是一个包含1737个英语谜题的基准测试，旨在评估大语言模型的多方面推理能力，包括逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足。测试显示即使是顶级模型也仅达到60%左右的准确率，并存在幻觉级联、自我确认偏见等深层问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估结构化技能如定量问题解决，缺乏对灵活、多方面推理能力的评估，而这些能力是人类智能的核心，需要整合逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足。

Method: 引入RiddleBench基准测试，包含1737个具有挑战性的英语谜题，用于探测核心推理能力。评估了包括Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3和Claude 4 Sonnet在内的最先进模型。

Result: 顶级专有模型的准确率仅略高于60%（60.30%、63.37%和63.16%）。分析揭示了深层失败，包括幻觉级联（接受其他模型的错误推理）和由于强烈的自我确认偏见导致的自我纠正能力差。推理也很脆弱，当约束重新排序或引入无关信息时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断这些问题的工具，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

### [17] [Disaggregation Reveals Hidden Training Dynamics: The Case of Agreement Attraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24934)
*James A. Michaelov,Catherine Arnett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过心理语言学方法分析语言模型在不同句法语境中的错误模式，揭示训练过程中语法学习的中间阶段，发现模型在不同训练阶段会采用词频和局部上下文等启发式策略而非通用语法规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然通常能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些特定语境中更容易出错。研究旨在通过精细分析这些错误模式，理解语言模型在训练过程中的语法学习机制和中间阶段。

Method: 使用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，在不同句法条件下对模型错误进行细粒度分析，并比较模型在训练过程中各条件下的表现变化。

Result: 研究发现语言模型在训练的不同阶段表现出不同的行为模式：某些阶段模型更依赖词频和局部上下文等启发式策略，而非掌握通用的语法规则。

Conclusion: 这种基于细粒度条件分析的方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体概括化模式的有力工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

### [18] [SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24940)
*Yinhan He,Wendy Zheng,Yaochen Zhu,Zaiyi Zheng,Lin Su,Sriram Vasudevan,Qi Guo,Liangjie Hong,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT是一个新颖的语义对齐隐式思维链框架，通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和保持与真实推理的语义对齐来提高CoT效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式CoT方法存在两个主要挑战：(1) 无法保持隐式推理与真实推理之间的语义对齐，导致CoT性能显著下降；(2) 忽视了生成单个隐式推理令牌的时间成本。

Method: 设计了对比训练句子转换器评估语义对齐，并引入高效的隐式推理生成器，通过知识蒸馏微调轻量级语言模型。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，SemCoT在效率和有效性方面均优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和保持语义对齐来增强CoT效率的方法。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

### [19] [Language Model Behavioral Phases are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24963)
*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在不同架构、数据集和规模下，其训练过程中的行为变化模式高度一致，98%的词级行为方差可由三个简单启发式解释：词频、n-gram概率和语义相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同语言模型在预训练过程中的行为变化模式是否具有一致性，以及这些变化是否可由简单统计特征解释。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点，涵盖Transformer、Mamba、RWKV等架构，在OpenWebText和The Pile数据集上，规模从1400万到120亿参数，评估了超过11万个英语token。

Result: 发现语言模型行为变化高度一致，98%的词级方差可由词频、n-gram概率和语义相似度三个启发式解释。模型在训练过程中会经历一致的行为阶段，预测概率逐渐过拟合到更高阶的n-gram概率。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习轨迹可能独立于模型具体细节，遵循相似的发展模式，这为理解语言模型学习机制提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

*Chin-Jou Li,Kalvin Chang,Shikhar Bharadwaj,Eunjung Yeo,Kwanghee Choi,Jian Zhu,David Mortensen,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POWSM是首个统一框架，能够联合执行多个语音相关任务，包括语音识别、音素识别、字形到音素转换和音素到字形转换，在保持与专用模型相当性能的同时实现多功能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音处理任务在概念上相似，但现有研究往往孤立进行，每个任务都依赖特定的架构和数据集，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 引入POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model）统一框架，能够在音频、文本（字形）和音素之间进行无缝转换。

Result: POWSM在相似规模下优于或匹配专用音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: 该模型为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，训练数据、代码和模型已开源以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

*Rabin Adhikari*

TL;DR: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化间接宾语识别任务上，发现单层双头模型即可完美解决该任务，揭示了高度可解释的最小推理电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的复杂性往往掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，希望通过训练小型模型来研究transformer推理的计算基础。

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化IOI任务上，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来分析模型机制。

Result: 单层双头模型在IOI任务上达到完美准确率，两个头分别专门化为加性和对比性子电路；两层单头模型通过查询-值交互也能实现类似性能。

Conclusion: 任务特定训练能诱导出高度可解释的最小电路，为研究transformer推理的计算基础提供了受控测试平台。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的表现，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征，表明文本表征在模型中占据主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管口语语言模型在音频理解方面取得了进展，但对其泛化能力以及是否真正整合音频和文本模态存在疑问，特别是在情感不一致的语音样本中。

Method: 使用情感不一致的语音样本数据集（EMIS），评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的表现，分析模型对文本语义和语音情感特征的依赖程度。

Result: 结果显示口语语言模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征来完成任务，表明文本相关表征在很大程度上主导了音频表征。

Conclusion: 口语语言模型在情感识别任务中未能有效整合音频和文本模态，文本表征占据主导地位，这对其通用音频理解能力提出了挑战。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

TL;DR: 本研究调查大型语言模型识别生物医学文献中知识空白的能力，包括明确空白和隐含空白，并引入TABI推理方案来结构化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于识别未知领域，但现有研究主要关注明确知识空白检测，本研究扩展至隐含知识空白的推断任务。

Method: 在四个数据集上对近1500份文档进行实验，对比闭源和开源模型，引入TABI（Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference）推理方案来结构化推理和验证推断结论。

Result: LLMs在识别明确和隐含知识空白方面表现出强大能力，闭源和开源模型均表现良好，较大模型通常表现更佳。

Conclusion: LLMs具备系统性识别候选知识空白的强大能力，可支持早期研究制定、政策制定和资助决策，同时需要领域适应、人机验证和跨模型基准测试。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨大型语言模型能否评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度。实验表明LLMs可以近似估计认知复杂度，但存在推理能力与元认知意识之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，阅读理解题目的认知复杂度特征依赖人工标注，现有NLP工具难以提取。本研究旨在探索LLMs能否自动估计这些认知特征，为题目难度分析提供工具。

Method: 通过让LLMs评估阅读理解题目的两个认知维度——证据范围和转换水平，来估计认知复杂度，并与人类标注进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似估计题目的认知复杂度，证明其作为先验难度分析工具的潜力。但发现LLMs的推理能力与元认知意识存在差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在估计阅读理解题目认知复杂度方面具有潜力，但需要解决其推理过程与自我认知之间的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol是一个半无监督框架，用于在多维叙事极性场中重建和解释语义极性，通过人类参与定义上下文边界，结合Transformer语言模型嵌入和降维技术，量化语义位移并生成对比标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算语言学方法将情感视为单维度尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构。本文旨在开发能够捕捉多维语义极性的框架，适用于情感和非情感语义转变分析。

Method: 使用Transformer大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调谐UMAP投影，通过Leiden算法分割主题。在定义上下文边界后，计算主题边界质心间的方向向量，生成极性场量化语义位移，并用LLM解释极性向量。

Result: 在两个语料库上评估：美联储演讲（非情感语义转变）和亚马逊产品评论（情感极性）。结果显示TOPol能一致捕捉情感和非情感极性转变，方法对上下文边界定义敏感但整体稳定。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化且可解释的框架，适用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析，能够有效捕捉语义极性变化。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式高度模糊和长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要评估生成式LLM在此领域的表现。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计四种提示实验（局部、上下文增强、缩写和实体词典等域特定线索），并与SpanBERT判别式方法进行对比。

Result: LLMs在表面级共指消解能力较强，特别是在域接地提示下，但对长距离上下文和指称模糊性仍敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下表现出更高的精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程可以增强LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，生成式方法在特定条件下可与判别式方法相媲美。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: DEBATE是首个大规模实证基准，用于评估多智能体角色扮演LLM交互的真实性，包含29,417条来自2,792名美国参与者的多轮辩论对话，涵盖107个争议话题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模社交互动中的观点变化对于解决错误信息和两极分化问题至关重要。现有LLM角色扮演设置往往产生不自然的动态，缺乏衡量真实人类观点轨迹的实证基准。

Method: 引入DEBATE基准，包含大规模人类辩论对话数据，系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异，并通过监督微调使LLM与人类行为对齐。

Result: 通过监督微调在表面指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上取得改进，但在更深层次的语义对齐（如语义相似性）方面仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言机器翻译性能与高资源语言之间的差距，为边缘化社区和代表性不足群体开发更包容、准确的NLP模型。

Method: 基于Reid和Artetxe（2021）的预训练方法，探索多种预训练策略，包括多语言集成以及在预训练阶段同时使用单语和平行数据。

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

Result: 提供了大语言模型遗忘领域的全面概述，包括方法分类、评估框架和实用指南，帮助研究人员更好地理解和应用遗忘技术。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是确保大语言模型安全可靠的关键技术，本综述为相关研究提供了系统指导和未来发展方向，推动安全可靠大语言模型的持续发展。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

### [30] [Explainable Disentanglement on Discrete Speech Representations for Noise-Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25150)
*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声的方法，通过端到端模型分离出干净的语音代码标记，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，显著提升了噪声环境下的语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但现有方法在嘈杂或真实环境中表现不佳，需要优化噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 基于Whisper嵌入的量化方法，在潜在空间中解耦语义内容和背景噪声，使用端到端模型分离干净语音代码标记，并通过轻量级分类器监督噪声向量。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper错误率降低82%，比基线方法提升35%，学习到的标记空间在已见和未见声学条件下都具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了噪声环境下的语音识别性能，生成的语音标记具有高度噪声不变性，且在多种声学条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [31] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDP框架重新定义了AI检索范式，将原始文档转换为LLM可消费的结构化知识表示，包括智能推理、记忆基础和结构化利用三种途径。MDP-Agent作为实现，通过文档级记忆、扩散探索和映射归约合成，在信息检索基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法返回原始文本片段，将片段组装和上下文推理的负担留给LLM。原始文档长、嘈杂且非结构化，不适合LLM直接使用，需要新的检索范式来弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出模型-文档协议(MDP)框架，通过三种途径转换非结构化文档：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记以丰富推理；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等正式表示。MDP-Agent实现包括文档级记忆构建、扩散探索和映射归约合成。

Result: 在信息检索基准测试中，MDP-Agent优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架成功重新定义了模型与文档的交互方式，将原始文本转换为紧凑、结构化的知识表示，直接支持LLM推理，解决了传统检索方法的局限性。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [32] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过测试大语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，发现模型性能与语言资源丰富度直接相关，且Chain-of-Thought提示的有效性取决于模型的基础能力和任务上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型的优异表现是源于真正的能力还是英语数据的优势，通过低资源语言测试来验证。

Method: 基于Next Sentence Prediction任务，创建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入Chain-of-Thought提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上大幅下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。Chain-of-Thought对LLaMA 3有帮助，但对GPT-4和Gemini反而造成"过度思考"而降低性能。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought不是通用解决方案，其有效性高度依赖于模型的基础能力和任务上下文，框架能识别LLM弱点并揭示CoT在跨语言NSP中的影响机制。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

### [33] [ProMediate: A Socio-cognitive framework for evaluating proactive agents in multi-party negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25224)
*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate是首个评估复杂多议题多方谈判中主动AI调解代理的框架，包含基于现实谈判案例的模拟测试平台和基于社会认知理论的评估指标，证明了社会智能调解代理优于通用基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估主动AI代理在多党协作中的方法，限制了开发能有效支持多人协作的AI的进展。谈判作为具有挑战性的测试平台，需要社会认知智能来应对多方多议题的利益冲突并建立共识。

Method: ProMediate框架包含两个核心组件：(1)基于现实谈判案例和理论驱动难度级别的模拟测试平台，配备基于社会认知调解理论的即插即用主动AI调解代理；(2)包含共识变化、干预延迟、调解效果和智能度等新指标的社会认知评估框架。

Result: 社会智能调解代理在ProMediate-Hard设置中，相比通用基线将共识变化提高了3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），同时响应速度快77%（15.98秒 vs 3.71秒），通过更快、更有针对性的干预实现更好表现。

Conclusion: ProMediate提供了一个严谨、理论基础的测试平台，用于推进主动、社会智能代理的发展，为评估多党环境中的社会认知智能建立了系统框架。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言领域特定问答面临的两个关键挑战：标注数据集稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 使用大语言模型(LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B)生成合成问答对，通过多阶段微调策略让轻量级语言模型适应印地语旅游领域。

Result: 大模型能高效生成合成数据，小模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展路径。

Conclusion: 多阶段微调结合合成数据增强是解决低资源语言领域特定问答的有效方法，展示了从大模型到小模型的知识转移可行性。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PEKD框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型进行蒸馏，增强参数高效微调方法在少样本多模态讽刺检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源环境下具有挑战性，因为稀缺的标注数据使得模型难以学习图像-文本间的微妙矛盾。现有的参数高效微调方法虽然减少了过拟合，但在少样本数据下由于监督有限而难以达到最优性能。

Method: PEKD框架通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型（教师模型）进行知识蒸馏来增强PEFT方法。为了缓解教师模型不可靠信号的问题，引入了基于熵感知的门控机制，根据教师置信度动态调整蒸馏强度。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使PEFT方法在少样本场景下超越了先前的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型，取得了强劲的结果。

Conclusion: PEKD是一个模块化且可适应多种多模态模型和任务的框架，有效解决了少样本多模态讽刺检测中的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Parrot训练框架，通过整合自然语言思维链(N-CoT)和程序思维链(P-CoT)两种范式，实现相互增强，显著提升数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常单向增强N-CoT或P-CoT，本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势实现相互增强和同步改进。

Method: 1) 设计三个目标子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 采用子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可转移性；3) 设计转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提高了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot框架成功实现了N-CoT和P-CoT的相互增强，为数学推理任务提供了有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Motivation: 商业代理在处理复杂业务环境时面临数据关系错综复杂和任务类型多样化的挑战，需要提升其在复杂数据和多任务场景下的能力。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和强化学习训练范式，使代理模型适应复杂业务环境；在推理阶段引入共享记忆机制，让代理从类似问题的任务指南中学习。

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中都取得了竞争性结果，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CRMWeaver方法能够有效提升商业代理在复杂业务环境中的表现，具有实际应用价值，特别是在未见过的场景中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对在法律解释中使用大语言模型，发现模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，且与人类判断相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期有学者和联邦法官提议将大语言模型纳入法律解释工具包的做法，本文旨在通过实证研究验证这种做法的可行性。

Method: 使用英文进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式来测试模型的稳定性，并评估模型判断与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 研究表明模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，改变问题格式会导致结论差异巨大；模型与人类判断只有弱到中等程度的相关性，且不同模型和问题变体间存在很大差异。

Conclusion: 对生成式AI得出的结论给予过多信任是危险的，当前不应将大语言模型作为可靠的法律解释工具。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

Motivation: 研究小规模语言模型是否能够通过指令调优获得性能提升，探索人类启发式学习策略在低资源语言模型中的适用性。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的仅解码器模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并或顺序课程两种方式，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK、WUGs等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 指令调优在微调场景中产生小幅但一致的增益，顺序课程优于合并数据；但改进不能持续转移到零样本任务，表明交互聚焦适应与广泛语言泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 结果突出了将人类启发学习策略适应低资源语言模型的潜力和约束，并指向混合、基于课程的方法来增强生态训练限制下的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在文献推荐中产生不存在论文的幻觉问题，探索引用频率对幻觉率的影响。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献记录，通过余弦相似度手动验证生成与真实元数据的事实一致性。

Result: 幻觉率因研究领域而异，引用次数与事实准确性强相关，引用超过约1000次的论文几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文在模型中被近逐字保留，表明存在从泛化到记忆的转变阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a

TL;DR: 提出了SQPsych框架，使用LLM生成基于结构化心理问卷的合成心理咨询对话，解决了心理健康AI发展中真实治疗对话数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于缺乏真实的治疗对话数据，主要原因是隐私法规严格和历史临床会话很少被记录。

Method: 基于认知行为疗法原则，开发了SQPsych框架，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话，使用开源权重LLM生成高质量语料库。

Result: 在SQPsychConv上微调的SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，在关键治疗技能上超越了基线模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据有潜力实现可扩展、数据安全且临床信息化的心理健康AI支持。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1是首个针对印度知识系统的领域特定、多任务、双语基准测试，包含74,166个精心策划的问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四大领域，用于评估LLMs在印度语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多以英语为中心且领域无关，限制了其在印度语境下的适用性，需要针对印度文化和领域的专门评估工具。

Method: 从真实的政府和领域特定考试中收集52,494个英语和21,672个印地语问答对，涵盖90+个子领域和500+个主题，对29+个LLMs进行细粒度评估。

Result: 评估显示显著的领域和语言特定性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率达76.49%，但在阿育吠陀领域仅为59.74%；所有模型在英语内容上的表现均优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域的能力提供了全面数据集，支持模型整合领域特定知识与双语理解能力的评估。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM服务系统架构，通过服务程序而非提示词来解决现有系统效率低、灵活性差的问题，引入了LLM推理程序(LIPs)概念和名为Symphony的系统实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统主要为文本补全设计，无法高效适应日益复杂的LLM应用，存在设计不灵活的问题。

Method: 提出LLM推理程序(LIPs)架构，允许用户在运行时自定义token预测和KV缓存管理，将部分应用逻辑卸载到服务器；通过Symphony系统实现，该系统作为LIPs的操作系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，用专用文件系统虚拟化KV缓存，采用两级进程调度确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统能够更高效、可扩展地支持复杂LLM应用，为LLM应用生态系统打开了新的大门。

Conclusion: 基于程序的LLM服务架构比基于提示词的传统架构更高效和可扩展，Symphony系统展示了这种新架构的潜力。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出首个利用视觉语言模型(VLMs)自动标注和过滤手语数据集的框架，从TikTok视频中构建多语言手语数据集TikTok-SL-8，减少对人工标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂。VLMs作为评估器和实时助手的能力尚未在手语数据采集中得到充分利用。

Method: 基于VLM的流水线包括：人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频内容文本提取、视频与文本对齐验证，实现通用过滤、标注和验证步骤。应用于8种手语的TikTok视频和已有的YouTube-SL-25数据集。

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8多语言手语数据集，在两个现成SLT模型上评估了德语和美国手语的性能，为自动提取的含噪声数据建立了基准。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了可扩展的弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型理解隐含意义的能力及其对提升人机交互质量的影响，发现理解隐含意义能显著改善模型响应质量，特别是对较小模型效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，语言成为人机交互的核心。研究关注交互的语言学基础，特别是隐含意义（通过共享上下文传达的言外之意），这对人机对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究考察了LLMs推断用户嵌入在上下文驱动提示中的意图的能力，以及理解隐含意义是否能改善响应生成。

Result: 结果显示较大模型更接近人类理解，而较小模型在隐含意义推理上表现较差。基于隐含意义的提示显著提高了所有模型响应的相关性和质量，较小模型提升尤为明显。67.6%的参与者更喜欢隐含意义嵌入的提示而非字面提示。

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于理解如何利用语言学理论解决对齐问题，使人机交互更加自然和基于上下文。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在精选基准测试中表现优异，但在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化的实际影响仍然有限，需要更真实的评估环境。

Method: 利用真实Lean Blueprint形式化项目，构建包含613个定理的评估套件RLMEval，涵盖6个Lean项目，专注于研究级数学挑战。

Result: 在RLMEval上评估最先进模型显示显著差距：现有基准测试的进展难以转化为现实场景，最佳模型仅达到10.3%的通过率。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，将LLM在定性研究中的使用按解释深度和自主性两个维度分类，建议通过任务分解和有限自主性来平衡效率与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战，为研究者提供实用的设计指导。

Method: 构建二维分类框架（解释深度×自主性），基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具的社科论文进行文献分析。

Result: 识别了LLM在社科研究中的使用模式，提出了类似委派给本科生研究助理的任务分解策略。

Conclusion: 通过保持低自主性和在监督下选择性提高解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时获得LLM的益处。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文研究了手语翻译自动评估指标的局限性，分析了BLEU、ROUGE等传统指标和LLM评估器在语义对等、幻觉检测等方面的表现，发现文本指标存在不足，需要多模态评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估主要依赖文本指标，但这些指标能否可靠评估SLT输出质量尚不明确，需要系统分析其局限性。

Method: 通过分析6种评估指标（包括BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT和LLM评估器G-Eval、GEMBA），在三种受控条件下测试其一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出幻觉和句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在明显局限，LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义对等但偏向LLM释义翻译；所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例较宽松。

Conclusion: 文本评估指标不足以全面评估手语翻译质量，需要开发超越文本的多模态评估框架来实现更全面的SLT输出评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask框架通过利用专家轨迹中的"观测未来"信息，直接从离线数据学习主动对话代理，无需用户模拟器，成功将被动LLM转化为主动目标导向的合作伙伴。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要作为被动响应者，但在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴。现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"问题。

Method: 利用专家轨迹中的观测未来信息推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化(action, state_assessment)元组，并通过自动评分器校准管道净化基于LLM的奖励模型噪声。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证了Learn-to-Ask的有效性，使用高达32B参数的LLM，在内部严格评估中部署到在线AI服务，性能甚至优于人类专家。

Conclusion: 该工作为将被动LLM转化为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，能够将离线数据转化为实际现实世界影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架在通用和自定义领域特定数据集上微调LLMs，特别是在政治和安全领域。

Result: 指令微调显著提高了摘要和标记的准确性，LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域特定微调后超越了中文训练模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: LLMs和NER的集成为将非结构化文本转化为可操作见解提供了强大解决方案，支持现代知识管理和安全操作。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

TL;DR: TwinVoice是一个评估LLM在真实场景中模拟人物角色的综合基准，涵盖社交、人际和叙事三个维度，分解为六项基本能力评估。实验显示先进模型在人物模拟方面表现中等，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，整体性能远低于人类基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的人物角色模拟评估存在局限：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、未分析能力需求。需要开发更全面的评估基准来准确衡量LLM模拟个体沟通风格、行为倾向和个性特征的能力。

Method: 提出TwinVoice基准，包含三个维度：社交角色（公共社交互动）、人际角色（私人对话）和叙事角色（基于角色的表达）。将LLM性能评估分解为六项基本能力：观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、角色语气和句法风格。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在人物角色模拟方面达到中等准确率，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上表现不足。LLM的平均性能显著低于人类基线水平。

Conclusion: 虽然先进LLM在人物角色模拟方面取得了一定进展，但在关键能力如句法风格和记忆回忆方面仍有明显差距，表明当前模型在真实人物模拟方面还有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 虽然LLM智能体通常从行动规划角度研究如何完成目标，但它们在协作实现共同目标方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 采用微调加验证器框架，为LLM智能体配备各种沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题桌面游戏中测试协作能力。

Result: 实证结果强调了对齐沟通的重要性，有趣的是，无沟通的智能体仍能实现高任务性能，但缺乏真正的规则理解和人类评估者的信任。

Conclusion: 通过集成基于环境的验证器，增强了智能体理解任务规则和完成任务的能力，促进了AI系统中更安全、更可解释的协作。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理复杂多跳查询时存在幻觉问题，无法满足波斯穆斯林社区对权威宗教问答准确性的高要求。

Method: 采用FAIR-RAG架构：基于信仰的自适应迭代优化框架，动态分解复杂查询，评估证据充分性，通过迭代生成子查询填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中取得SOTA性能：负面拒绝率达97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确率达74.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为波斯伊斯兰问答设定了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构在敏感领域构建可靠AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Method: 使用7种奖励模型家族，在五个法律多选问答基准上评估结果级和过程级验证方法，重点关注低预算条件下的表现。

Result: 系统分析了验证器效用的关键影响因素，包括领域专业化程度、模型大小和监督类型等。

Conclusion: 在法律领域，测试时缩放技术能够有效提升模型性能，但验证器的效用受到多种因素影响。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估语言模型推理效率的框架，通过逻辑编程来衡量模型在推理过程中避免不必要推断的能力。研究发现当前语言模型在面对包含无关信息的数学问题时，准确率显著下降，且生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估主要关注正确性，而忽略了推理效率这一人类推理的关键方面。在真实推理场景中，大量可用信息是无关的，有效的演绎推理需要识别并忽略这些干扰信息。

Method: 提出基于逻辑编程的评估框架，通过将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序执行找到的最短证明进行对齐，量化推理效率。构建了包含不同数量无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验发现当前语言模型在面对包含无关信息的场景时准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰也会影响性能。模型生成的证明经常包含通过无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型在推理效率方面存在不足，需要开发能够更好识别和忽略无关信息的推理方法，以提高在真实世界推理场景中的表现。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: 提出了EHR-Ins数据集、EHR-R1模型和EHR-Bench基准，显著提升了电子健康记录分析的可靠性和临床相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大语言模型在EHR分析方面能力有限，存在任务覆盖范围窄和缺乏面向EHR的推理能力的问题。

Method: 采用思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量推理数据，通过多阶段训练范式（领域适应、推理增强和强化学习）开发EHR-R1模型系列。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上比GPT-4o高出30多分，在EHRSHOT上零样本AUROC提高10%，持续优于最先进的商业和开源LLM。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同显著推进了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了PairUni框架，通过将数据重组为理解-生成对来平衡视觉语言模型中的理解和生成任务，使用Pair-GPRO算法减少任务干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单一架构中同时执行理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问答对，形成对齐对；检索语义相关的理解示例形成检索对；提出Pair-GPRO算法，通过相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 在Janus-Pro等UVLMs上实现了平衡的改进，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据配对和配对感知的强化学习，有效解决了视觉语言模型中理解和生成任务的平衡问题。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

TL;DR: 比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM在贷款违约预测任务中的表现，发现LLM能识别关键风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM存在显著差异，且自解释与SHAP归因不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为分类模型替代传统机器学习模型在结构化表格数据（特别是高风险金融应用）中的适用性。

Method: 在真实贷款违约预测任务上系统比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM，评估预测性能、使用SHAP分析特征归因，并评估LLM自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，且自解释往往与经验SHAP归因不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为独立模型在结构化金融风险预测中存在局限性，其自解释的可信度存疑，需要在风险敏感金融环境中进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

TL;DR: Toolathlon是一个用于评估语言代理的基准测试，涵盖32个软件应用和604个工具，提供多样化的应用、真实环境设置和可靠的执行评估，旨在解决现有基准测试在多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理基准测试往往专注于狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏评估代理在现实世界中处理复杂多步骤工作流所需的多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性。

Method: 基于高质量MCP服务器集构建，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个手动收集或制作的任务，每个任务平均需要约20轮交互才能完成，并通过专用评估脚本进行严格验证。

Result: 最先进模型表现显著不足：表现最佳的Claude-4.5-Sonnet仅达到38.6%的成功率，平均需要20.2次工具调用；表现最佳的开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp达到20.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Toolathlon有望推动开发更强大的语言代理，以处理现实世界中的长时程任务执行。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现说服性提示能显著增强被刻意遗忘的大语言模型的事实知识回忆能力，效果与模型大小呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型遗忘效果的挑战，需要开发有效的方法来测试被遗忘知识是否真的被移除。

Method: 提出SKeB框架，基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论，通过领域图建模信息纠缠，使用说服性提示测试被遗忘模型的事实回忆能力。

Result: 说服性提示显著提高事实知识回忆（从14.8%提升到24.5%），且效果与模型大小负相关（2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型仅恢复15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估大语言模型遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础，证明说服性提示能有效激活被遗忘知识。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型家族，通过在潜在空间进行迭代计算、使用熵正则化目标进行深度分配，以及大规模数据训练，将推理能力直接构建到预训练阶段，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行推理，这导致推理能力被推迟到训练后阶段，未能充分利用预训练数据。

Method: 提出循环语言模型LoopLM，包含：(1)在潜在空间进行迭代计算；(2)使用熵正则化目标学习深度分配；(3)扩展到7.7T tokens的大规模预训练。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中表现优异，匹配了高达12B参数的最先进LLM结果，优势主要来自更好的知识操纵能力而非知识容量。

Conclusion: 循环语言模型作为推理时代的新扩展方向具有巨大潜力，能够产生比显式思维链更与最终输出对齐的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: 提出从一次性任务完成评估转向协作代理评估，引入协作努力扩展框架来衡量代理在用户参与增加时的效用增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理评估主要关注一次性任务完成，忽略了现实世界问题的迭代和协作性质，其中人类目标往往不明确且不断演变。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮真实场景中的表现。

Result: 最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与和支持用户理解的能力。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了视角。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了DiagramEval，一种用于评估LLM生成演示图的新颖评估指标，将图视为图结构，通过节点对齐和路径对齐来评估图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图在研究论文中传达思想至关重要，但创建复杂且耗时。虽然图以图像形式呈现，但标准图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图。LLM可以直接生成SVG格式的图，但缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 将图概念化为图结构，将文本元素视为节点，连接视为有向边，使用节点对齐和路径对齐两组新指标评估图质量。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM在最新研究文献上生成的图，定量证明了所提指标的有效性，并提供了对LLM生成图特征的深入见解。

Conclusion: DiagramEval为LLM生成的演示图提供了有效的评估框架，增强了评估的可解释性，为改进图生成模型提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法在抽取式问答中表现良好，但在多跳、抽象和半抽取式场景中表现不佳，这些场景需要跨段落合成信息。

Method: 提出DecompTune后训练方法，教导模型生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤，使用两阶段SFT + GRPO流水线进行训练。

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，优于先前方法，匹配或超过了最先进的边界模型。

Conclusion: 将事后归因重构为推理问题，通过答案分解可以显著提升复杂问答任务中的归因可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，通过完全开源的方式为多语言语言模型开发建立可复现的基础。

Method: 使用神经质量分类器过滤法语和英语数据集，开发高效的数据整理和训练框架，发布数百个中间检查点，并研究数据过滤与污染对性能的影响。

Result: 发现语言质量过滤能提高文本流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；后期故意污染可以恢复有竞争力的分数，同时合理损害生成质量；神经过滤可能无意中放大基准泄漏。

Conclusion: Gaperon为探索数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡提供了可复现的基础，支持多语言语言模型开发的进一步研究。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

*Jason Godfrey,Trisha Banerjee*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 使用优化的XGBoost回归模型从不完整的行政数据中估计学区级高剂量辅导支出，预测总额约22亿美元，模型R²=0.358。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19疫情导致K-12学生学业损失严重，联邦政府拨款1900亿美元救济，但具体支出类别金额未知，需要估计辅导支出。

Method: 使用自定义抓取的7000多份ESSER计划数据集，基于学区特征（入学人数、总ESSER资金、城市化程度、学校数量）建立XGBoost回归模型。

Result: 模型预测学区辅导支出总额约22亿美元，样本外R²=0.358，在报告异质性较大的情况下具有中等预测准确性。

Conclusion: 梯度提升决策树可以从稀疏或缺失的结构化数据中重建大规模财政模式，该框架可推广到其他需要从半结构化文本和稀疏行政来源恢复潜在变量的政策评估领域。

Abstract: This study applies an optimized XGBoost regression model to estimate
district-level expenditures on high-dosage tutoring from incomplete
administrative data. The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented learning loss,
with K-12 students losing up to half a grade level in certain subjects. To
address this, the federal government allocated \$190 billion in relief. We know
from previous research that small-group tutoring, summer and after school
programs, and increased support staff were all common expenditures for
districts. We don't know how much was spent in each category. Using a custom
scraped dataset of over 7,000 ESSER (Elementary and Secondary School Emergency
Relief) plans, we model tutoring allocations as a function of district
characteristics such as enrollment, total ESSER funding, urbanicity, and school
count. Extending the trained model to districts that mention tutoring but omit
cost information yields an estimated aggregate allocation of approximately
\$2.2 billion. The model achieved an out-of-sample $R^2$=0.358, demonstrating
moderate predictive accuracy given substantial reporting heterogeneity.
Methodologically, this work illustrates how gradient-boosted decision trees can
reconstruct large-scale fiscal patterns where structured data are sparse or
missing. The framework generalizes to other domains where policy evaluation
depends on recovering latent financial or behavioral variables from
semi-structured text and sparse administrative sources.

Motivation: 在科学市场中，当产出数量和投入价格不可观测时，需要开发新方法来估计研究人员的生产力信念，以评估资源配置效率。

Method: 构建研究人员劳动供给模型，通过其投入支付意愿揭示生产力信念，使用全国代表性研究人员调查数据进行参数估计。

Result: 发现生产力分布非常偏斜，反事实分析表明当前预算的更有效配置可能价值数十亿美元。

Conclusion: 开发识别有才华科学家的新方法具有巨大价值，能够显著提升科研资源配置效率。

Abstract: We develop a method to estimate producers' productivity beliefs when output
quantities and input prices are unobservable, and we use it to evaluate the
market for science. Our model of researchers' labor supply shows how their
willingness to pay for inputs reveals their productivity beliefs. We estimate
the model's parameters using data from a nationally representative survey of
researchers and find the distribution of productivity to be very skewed. Our
counterfactuals indicate that a more efficient allocation of the current budget
could be worth billions of dollars. There are substantial gains from developing
new ways of identifying talented scientists.

### [69] [Automation Experiments and Inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24923)
*Seth Benzell,Kyle Myers*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文研究了自动化技术对劳动生产率和收入不平等的影响，发现不平等效应取决于技能相关性以及工人技能与技术能力的相对水平，且这种效应通常是非单调的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越来越多的实验研究自动化技术对劳动生产率的影响，特别是关注技术是否会加剧高技能和低技能工人之间的不平等，这有助于预测技术持续改进的分配效应。

Method: 通过形式化理论模型，分析工人层面的产出如何依赖于任务层面的生产函数，考虑工人在任务层面技能的异质性，以及工人是自己执行任务还是委托给自动化技术的选择。

Result: 研究发现，改进自动化对不平等的影响取决于两个因素的交互作用：(i) 工人间任务层面技能的相关性；(ii) 工人技能相对于技术能力的关系。不平等效应的符号通常是非单调的，随着技术改进，不平等可能先减少后增加，或反之。

Conclusion: 模型表明，自动化技术的多样性将在不平等的演变中发挥重要作用，技能相关性可能是正相关或负相关，这取决于具体情况。

Abstract: An increasingly large number of experiments study the labor productivity
effects of automation technologies such as generative algorithms. A popular
question in these experiments relates to inequality: does the technology
increase output more for high- or low-skill workers? The answer is often used
to anticipate the distributional effects of the technology as it continues to
improve. In this paper, we formalize the theoretical content of this empirical
test, focusing on automation experiments as commonly designed. Worker-level
output depends on a task-level production function, and workers are
heterogeneous in their task-level skills. Workers perform a task themselves, or
they delegate it to the automation technology. The inequality effect of
improved automation depends on the interaction of two factors: ($i$) the
correlation in task-level skills across workers, and ($ii$) workers' skills
relative to the technology's capability. Importantly, the sign of the
inequality effect is often non-monotonic -- as technologies improve, inequality
may decrease then increase, or vice versa. Finally, we use data and theory to
highlight cases when skills are likely to be positively or negatively
correlated. The model generally suggests that the diversity of automation
technologies will play an important role in the evolution of inequality.

*Jacopo Timini*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 重新评估拉丁货币联盟对贸易的影响，使用改进的重力模型和更严谨的控制组定义，发现LMU在1870年代初期对成员国贸易有积极影响，之后逐渐消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视拉丁货币联盟的贸易效应，采用最新的重力模型方法，更准确地定义控制组以解决早期货币制度多样性问题。

Method: 使用先进的重力模型，考虑不同货币制度的控制组，通过多种样本和贸易数据源进行稳健性检验。

Result: LMU在1870年代初期对成员国贸易有显著正向影响，之后影响逐渐减弱至零，结果对各种潜在混杂因素和不同方法选择都具有稳健性。

Conclusion: 拉丁货币联盟在双金属制仍被视为可行货币体系时确实促进了成员国贸易，但这种影响是暂时的，随着时间推移而消失。

Abstract: This paper reexamines the effects of the Latin Monetary Union (LMU) - a 19th
century agreement among several European countries to standardize their
currencies through a bimetallic system based on fixed gold and silver content -
on trade. Unlike previous studies, this paper adopts the latest advances in
gravity modeling and a more rigorous approach to defining the control group by
accounting for the diversity of currency regimes during the early years of the
LMU. My findings suggest that the LMU had a positive effect on trade between
its members until the early 1870s, when bimetallism was still considered a
viable monetary system. These effects then faded, converging to zero. Results
are robust to the inclusion of additional potential confounders, the use of
various samples spanning different countries and trade data sources, and
alternative methodological choices.

### [71] [Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects and Network Fragility: Theory and Evidence from European Banking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24775)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个连续函数框架分析金融网络中的系统性风险，基于纳维-斯托克斯方法研究欧洲银行系统的传染动态，发现COVID-19大流行使网络脆弱性增加了26.9%，尽管银行数量减少了46%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立连续函数框架来分析金融网络中的系统性风险，扩展之前研究中的动态空间处理效应方法，特别关注COVID-19大流行对银行网络稳定性的因果影响。

Method: 使用欧洲银行管理局透明度演习（2014-2023）的高质量双边暴露数据，采用空间双重差分方法估计COVID-19对网络脆弱性的因果影响，通过系统拉普拉斯矩阵的代数连通性λ₂来测量网络脆弱性。

Result: COVID-19使网络脆弱性增加了26.9%（95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%], p<0.05），尽管银行数量减少了46%，这种效应持续到2023年，表明整合通过增强互联性增加了系统性脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究验证了连续空间动力学的理论预测，证明了连续函数方法在金融稳定性分析中的实证相关性，提出了针对谱中心性的网络资本要求和包含扩散动态的压力测试框架来解决耦合外部性。

Abstract: This paper develops and empirically implements a continuous functional
framework for analyzing systemic risk in financial networks, building on the
dynamic spatial treatment effect methodology established in our previous
studies. We extend the Navier-Stokes-based approach from our previous studies
to characterize contagion dynamics in the European banking system through the
spectral properties of network evolution operators. Using high-quality
bilateral exposure data from the European Banking Authority Transparency
Exercise (2014-2023), we estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
network fragility using spatial difference-in-differences methods adapted from
our previous studies. Our empirical analysis reveals that COVID-19 elevated
network fragility, measured by the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ of the
system Laplacian, by 26.9% above pre-pandemic levels (95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%],
p<0.05), with effects persisting through 2023. Paradoxically, this occurred
despite a 46% reduction in the number of banks, demonstrating that
consolidation increased systemic vulnerability by intensifying
interconnectedness-consistent with theoretical predictions from continuous
spatial dynamics. Our findings validate the key predictions from
\citet{kikuchi2024dynamical}: treatment effects amplify over time through
spatial spillovers, consolidation increases fragility when coupling strength
rises, and systems exhibit structural hysteresis preventing automatic reversion
to pre-shock equilibria. The results demonstrate the empirical relevance of
continuous functional methods for financial stability analysis and provide new
insights for macroprudential policy design. We propose network-based capital
requirements targeting spectral centrality and stress testing frameworks
incorporating diffusion dynamics to address the coupling externalities
identified in our analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前关于空间处理效应和金融网络脆弱性的研究，探索技术采纳如何同时通过地理邻近和供应链连接传播，为技术政策提供微观基础。

Method: 使用连续函数分析的空间衰减机制和谱图理论的网络传染动态构建双通道框架，分析500家公司在2010-2023年间采用六项技术的综合数据。

Result: 发现技术采用具有强指数地理衰减（κ≈0.043/公里），供应链连接使代数连通性增加300-380%，传统方法存在61%偏差，COVID-19后网络脆弱性增加24.5%。

Conclusion: 框架显示干预措施具有69公里空间范围和10.8倍网络放大因子，需要协调地理和供应链目标以实现最优效果。

Abstract: This paper develops a dual-channel framework for analyzing technology
diffusion that integrates spatial decay mechanisms from continuous functional
analysis with network contagion dynamics from spectral graph theory. Building
on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to
spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that
technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity
and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies
adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First,
technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial
decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of
$d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared =
0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks
whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as
adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding
0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences
methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in
estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that
network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment
effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial
contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides
micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69
kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated
geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在最优治疗分配下，非参数条件平均治疗效果（CATE）函数的福利和价值泛函的估计与推断理论。针对最优福利泛函，建立了半参数插值估计量的√n渐近正态性；对于一般价值泛函，估计量在1维非参数估计速率下渐近正态，并提供了基于筛Riesz表示子的方差估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在最优治疗分配策略下，如何对CATE函数的福利和价值泛函进行统计推断，这在政策评估和个性化治疗决策中具有重要意义。

Method: 使用半参数插值估计方法，针对最优福利泛函和一般价值泛函分别建立理论框架，提供渐近方差公式和基于筛Riesz表示子的方差估计器，包含子流形数值积分计算程序。

Result: 证明了最优福利泛函估计量的√n渐近正态性，一般价值泛函估计量在1维非参数速率下渐近正态。蒙特卡洛模拟显示良好的有限样本性能，JTPA数据集实证应用验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 福利泛函与一般价值泛函具有不同的收敛速率，关键差异在于边界子群体（CATE为零）上被积函数的性质。提出的估计和推断方法在理论和实证中都表现良好。

Abstract: We provide theoretical results for the estimation and inference of a class of
welfare and value functionals of the nonparametric conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) function under optimal treatment assignment, i.e.,
treatment is assigned to an observed type if and only if its CATE is
nonnegative. For the optimal welfare functional defined as the average value of
CATE on the subpopulation with nonnegative CATE, we establish the $\sqrt{n}$
asymptotic normality of the semiparametric plug-in estimators and provide an
analytical asymptotic variance formula. For more general value functionals, we
show that the plug-in estimators are typically asymptotically normal at the
1-dimensional nonparametric estimation rate, and we provide a consistent
variance estimator based on the sieve Riesz representer, as well as a proposed
computational procedure for numerical integration on submanifolds. The key
reason underlying the different convergence rates for the welfare functional
versus the general value functional lies in that, on the boundary subpopulation
for whom CATE is zero, the integrand vanishes for the welfare functional but
does not for general value functionals. We demonstrate in Monte Carlo
simulations the good finite-sample performance of our estimation and inference
procedures, and conduct an empirical application of our methods on the
effectiveness of job training programs on earnings using the JTPA data set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统经济建模中数据稀缺问题，利用LLM生成合成数据来提高经济计量推断的效率和可靠性。

Method: AEM首先通过LLM生成任务条件的合成选择，然后学习从任务特征和原始LLM选择到人类对齐选择的偏差校正映射，最后使用标准经济计量估计器进行推断。

Result: 在大规模联合研究中，仅使用10%原始数据拟合校正模型可降低需求参数估计误差；在区域现场实验中，混合模型校准10%地理区域估计的域外处理效应与完整人类实验结果高度匹配；时间外推中，仅使用第一天人类数据训练的结果优于仅人类基线。

Conclusion: AEM有潜力提高RCT效率，并为基于LLM的反事实生成建立了基础方法。

Abstract: We introduce Agentic Economic Modeling (AEM), a framework that aligns
synthetic LLM choices with small-sample human evidence for reliable econometric
inference. AEM first generates task-conditioned synthetic choices via LLMs,
then learns a bias-correction mapping from task features and raw LLM choices to
human-aligned choices, upon which standard econometric estimators perform
inference to recover demand elasticities and treatment effects.We validate AEM
in two experiments. In a large scale conjoint study with millions of
observations, using only 10% of the original data to fit the correction model
lowers the error of the demand-parameter estimates, while uncorrected LLM
choices even increase the errors. In a regional field experiment, a mixture
model calibrated on 10% of geographic regions estimates an out-of-domain
treatment effect of -65\pm10 bps, closely matching the full human experiment
(-60\pm8 bps).Under time-wise extrapolation, training with only day-one human
data yields -24 bps (95% CI: [-26, -22], p<1e-5),improving over the human-only
day-one baseline (-17 bps, 95% CI: [-43, +9], p=0.2049).These results
demonstrate AEM's potential to improve RCT efficiency and establish a
foundation method for LLM-based counterfactual generation.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该论文研究教育如何纠正错误信念，在序列社会学习模型中，未受教育者错误解读行动历史，而受教育者使用正确似然函数。教育通过打破错误级联来改善社会福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究教育作为纠正错误信念的补救措施，因为未受教育者会误解行动历史，导致错误的社会学习级联。

Method: 定义错误信念完美贝叶斯均衡，使用阈值规则和单一对数似然指数，推导教育价值的闭式统计量。

Result: 教育能几乎必然在有限时间内打破错误级联，有明确的预期打破时间界限，小规模教育补贴能显著提高去级联概率。

Conclusion: 教育是纠正错误信念的有效工具，通过适当补贴可以显著改善社会福利。

Abstract: We study education as a remedy for misspecified beliefs in a canonical
sequential social-learning model. Uneducated agents misinterpret action
histories - treating actions as if they were independent signals and,
potentially, overstating signal precision - while educated agents use the
correct likelihoods (and may also enjoy higher private precision). We define a
misspecified-belief PBE and show existence with a simple structure: education
is a cutoff in the realized cost and actions are threshold rules in a single
log-likelihood index. A closed-form value-of-education statistic compares the
accuracy of the educated versus uneducated decision at any history; this yields
transparent conditions for self-education. When a misspecified process sustains
an incorrect cascade, uniformly positive private value and a positive flip
probability imply that education breaks the cascade almost surely in finite
time, with an explicit bound on expected break time. We quantify welfare gains
from making education available and show how small per-education subsidies
sharply raise de-cascading probabilities and improve discounted welfare.
Extensions cover imperfect observability of education choices and a planner who
deploys history-dependent subsidies.

Motivation: 研究在发送者可以私下选择实验而决策者只能从有限样本中学习的设定下，信息传递和说服的动态特性，特别是采样摩擦如何影响均衡结果。

Method: 使用非参数学习规则分析经验支付函数的收敛性，通过hypo-convergence理论证明收敛到贝叶斯基准，并分析有限样本下的非单调效应。

Result: 经验支付函数收敛到完全信息基准，但有限样本下采样摩擦会产生非单调效应：在某些情况下（如检察官-法官博弈）可能导致比基准更信息丰富的实验，在偏好完全一致的情况下也可能减少信息揭示。

Conclusion: 决策者的样本大小会影响发送者的实验选择，对于状态独立偏好问题存在最优有限样本大小。结果对不完美信息反馈和学习规则选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: A sender persuades a strategically naive decisionmaker (DM) by committing
privately to an experiment. Sender's choice of experiment is unknown to the DM,
who must form her posterior beliefs nonparametrically by applying some learning
rule to an IID sample of (state, message) realizations.
  We show that, given mild regularity conditions, the empirical payoff
functions hypo-converge to the full-information counterpart. This is sufficient
to ensure that payoffs and optimal signals converge to the Bayesian benchmark.
  For finite sample sizes, the force of this "sampling friction" is
nonmonotonic: it can induce more informative experiments than the Bayesian
benchmark in settings like the classic Prosecutor-Judge game, and less
revelation even in situations with perfectly aligned preferences. For many
problems with state-independent preferences, we show that there is an optimal
finite sample size for the DM. Although the DM would always prefer a larger
sample for a fixed experiment, this result holds because the sample size
affects sender's choice of experiment.
  Our results are robust to imperfectly informative feedback and the choice of
learning rule.

Method: 通过探索几个具有规范吸引力的公理的含义来揭示受欢迎度指数的空间，从而刻画几个指数族，其中一些与Shapley值密切相关。

Result: 成功刻画了几个受欢迎度指数族，揭示了这些指数与Shapley值的紧密联系，并为音乐产业提供了新的补偿方法理论基础。

Conclusion: 本文的特征化有助于解决音乐产业中探索更适当地奖励艺术家的新方法的日益关注，并将这些指数族与Spotify和Deezer最近推出的新版税模型实际联系起来。

Abstract: We study the problem of measuring the popularity of artists in music
streaming platforms and the ensuing methods to compensate them (from the
revenues platforms raise by charging users). We uncover the space of popularity
indices upon exploring the implications of several axioms capturing principles
with normative appeal. As a result, we characterize several families of
indices. Some of them are intimately connected to the Shapley value, the
central tool in cooperative game theory. Our characterizations might help to
address the rising concern in the music industry to explore new methods that
reward artists more appropriately. We actually connect our families to the new
royalties models, recently launched by Spotify and Deezer.

Motivation: 研究交换经济中均衡数量的普遍性质，特别是在全开放价格单纯形上的总超额需求函数背景下。

Method: 使用奇点理论中的有限奇点类型概念，证明具有有限奇点类型的映射构成所有光滑映射的开放稠密子集，并将结果转化为交换经济的总超额需求函数集。

Result: 一般经济在强意义下（在Whitney拓扑中为开放稠密子集）具有有限数量的均衡，这一结果也适用于临界经济。

Conclusion: 扩展了Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu的经典结果，证明在全开放价格单纯形（而不仅仅是单纯形的紧子集）上定义的总超额需求函数具有有限均衡的普遍性质。

Abstract: We show that in the context of exchange economies defined by aggregate excess
demand functions on the full open price simplex, the generic economy has a
finite number of equilibria. Genericicity is proved also for critical economies
and, in both cases, in the strong sense that it holds for an open dense subset
of economies in the Whitney topology. We use the concept of finite singularity
type from singularity theory. This concept ensures that the number of
equilibria of a map appear only in finite number. We then show that maps of
finite singularity type make up an open and dense subset of all smooth maps and
translate the result to the set of aggregate excess demand functions of an
exchange economy.
  Along the way, we extend the classical results of Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu
to aggregate excess demand functions defined on the full open price simplex,
rather than just compact subsets of the simplex.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR数据调度方法通常依赖基于路径的指标来排序查询，忽略了这些查询的推理树结构，导致数据调度不够高效。

Method: 引入推理分数（r-score）来基于推理树结构衡量查询的学习难度，并提出了Re-Schedule调度算法，构建从结构简单（高r-score）到复杂（低r-score）查询的课程学习进度。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上的实验表明，Re-Schedule显著提高了平均准确率，最高增益达3.2%。

Conclusion: 对推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可以减轻医生的文档负担，提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理质量。但现实世界的复杂性使得E/M编码自动化成为一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 提出了ProFees框架，这是一个基于大型语言模型(LLM)的解决方案，专门设计来处理E/M编码中的各种复杂性问题。

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了E/M编码自动化中的现实世界复杂性问题，证明了其在提高编码准确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

TL;DR: PM4GRPO是一种推理感知的组相对策略优化方法，通过过程挖掘技术计算一致性奖励来增强策略模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练奖励方案通常只关注结果，缺乏对推理过程的关注。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算标量一致性奖励，衡量策略模型推理与预训练教师模型的对齐程度，增强标准的答案/格式奖励。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的基于GRPO的后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘进行推理感知的GRPO能有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: 提出KnowCoder-A1，通过多阶段课程强化学习在仅结果监督下训练LLM，实现知识库问答中的自主推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通过过程监督微调LLM，但缺乏探索激励，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习：先在小规模高质量轨迹上微调建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL缓解奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA零样本子集上相对提升11.1%，仅使用十二分之一训练数据。

Conclusion: 仅结果监督训练的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库问答中的自主代理推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法作为静态层应用于输入或输出，仅提供二元分类（安全或不安全），需要更动态、协作和可解释的安全对齐方法。

Method: 引入Agentic Moderation框架，包含Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector四个动态协作代理，实现上下文感知的审核。

Result: 在五个数据集和四个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，该方法将攻击成功率降低7-19%，保持稳定的不遵循率，并将拒绝率提高4-20%。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过利用代理架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了代理系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Conclusion: 该框架在能耗和驾驶性能方面均表现出优越性，为节能自动驾驶提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

TL;DR: 本文提出RAVR框架，通过利用答案引导推理来提升大语言模型的推理能力，解决了传统强化学习在模型能力不足时难以采样高质量推理路径的问题。

Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖模型能够以非零概率生成高质量推理路径，但对于超出模型当前能力的任务，这种路径难以采样，学习过程容易强化熟悉但次优的推理。受认知科学启发，作者发现解释答案比直接寻找答案更容易。

Method: 提出RAVR（参考答案引导变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代，通过答案来推导高质量推理路径。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线模型实现了持续改进，减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定策略在推理中的应用。

Conclusion: 答案条件推理能够显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志数据复杂且异构，现有自动特征工程方法存在可解释性差、操作僵化、适应性不足等问题。

Method: 采用多代理系统（想法代理、代码代理、批评代理、评估代理）协作生成、验证和实现特征想法，结合强化学习和遗传算法原理进行代理进化。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能生成可解释、领域相关的特征，显著提升模型性能并减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统为复杂现实环境中的自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Motivation: 精神共病在临床上很常见但诊断复杂，现有数据集难以支持多障碍同时诊断，需要开发能够处理共病的大规模对话数据集来改进诊断和治疗规划。

Method: 使用合成患者电子病历构建和多智能体诊断对话生成的方法，创建502个合成EMR，将临床访谈协议转化为分层状态机和上下文树，支持130多个诊断状态。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk为精神共病研究提供了宝贵资源，支持在一次对话中实现多障碍精神筛查的模型开发和评估，显著提升了诊断准确性和治疗规划能力。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主智能体（如ReAct）采用顺序推理和执行，无法利用独立子任务间的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: 训练智能体基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定可并行执行和必须顺序执行的工具。采用两阶段训练策略：先在高质量图规划数据集上进行监督微调，然后在策略性采样查询上使用基于正确性的奖励函数进行强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，同时通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升。

Conclusion: GAP框架通过依赖感知的任务编排，在保持任务准确性的同时大幅提升了执行效率，为复杂任务解决提供了更高效的智能体规划方法。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，影响了MCTS的样本效率

Method: 打破价值等价分组的范式，提出KVDA框架，允许分组具有不同价值但价值差异可推断的状态和状态-动作对，并修改OGA-UCT使用该框架

Result: KVDA-UCT在多种确定性环境和参数设置下显著检测到比OGA-UCT更多的抽象，性能优于OGA-UCT

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，能够发现更多抽象，有效提升MCTS的样本效率

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险来源，试图限制其症状，但本文认为这种观点存在局限性，需要重新审视工具性目标的本质。

Method: 借鉴亚里士多德本体论及其现代解释，构建哲学论证，将高级AI系统视为具有自身形式与质料构成的实体，其工具性倾向是构成性的必然结果。

Result: 论证了工具性目标应被视为AI系统构成的自然产物，而非偶然故障，这为AI对齐提供了新的理论基础。

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更多地关注理解、管理和引导工具性目标朝向人类对齐的目标，而非试图消除这些目标本身。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has emerged as a unifying framework for planning
and decision-making problems where multiple, often conflicting, criteria must
be balanced. While the problem has been studied for decades, recent years have
seen renewed interest in the topic across AI applications such as robotics,

TL;DR: 提出了MTIR-SQL框架，通过多轮工具集成推理和动态执行反馈来改进Text-to-SQL任务，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MTIR-SQL框架，采用执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤中无缝整合数据库执行反馈，实现上下文敏感的查询生成和渐进式优化。扩展GRPO算法以适应复杂多轮交互场景，并添加轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束。

Result: MTIR-SQL在BIRD Dev上达到64.4%的准确率，在SPIDER Dev上达到84.6%的执行准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过多轮工具集成推理和动态反馈机制，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了该方法在复杂交互场景中的有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型为逻辑规则中的未命名谓词生成有意义的名称，以提升逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程中，各种规则生成方法会产生包含未命名谓词的规则，这阻碍了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。

Method: 利用大型语言模型处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名建议。

Result: 在手工制作的逻辑规则上评估表明，大型语言模型在这项任务上具有潜力。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型有望解决逻辑规则中谓词命名的问题，提升逻辑理论的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的零强化学习范式，通过结合可验证奖励和生成奖励模型，在可验证和不可验证领域进行多任务训练，提升语言模型的推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 当前零强化学习研究主要关注容易验证奖励的领域（如数学、编程），而在验证不直接的多样化场景中激发推理能力的研究不足。

Method: 结合可验证奖励与生成奖励模型进行多任务零强化学习训练，设计平滑长度惩罚机制防止奖励黑客攻击，鼓励生成更全面的思考标记。

Conclusion: 所提出的零强化学习范式能有效提升语言模型在多样化场景中的推理能力，实现推理能力在不同领域间的迁移。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有探索方法存在局限性：主动探索在高维环境中表现不佳，被动探索受限于样本多样性不足。需要一种能有效增强探索而不改变算法核心结构的方法。

Method: MoGE包含两个组件：(1)基于扩散模型的关键状态生成器，通过效用函数评估状态对策略探索的潜在影响；(2)一步想象世界模型，基于关键状态构建关键转换用于智能体学习。

Result: 在OpenAI Gym和DeepMind Control Suite上的实验结果表明，MoGE有效连接了探索和策略学习，在复杂控制任务中显著提高了样本效率和性能。

Conclusion: MoGE作为一种模块化方法，可与现有算法无缝集成，在不改变其核心结构的情况下显著改善探索效果，在强化学习中实现了探索与学习的有效平衡。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首个将微调LLM联盟与推理LLM集成应用于临床精神健康诊断的工作，为下一代AI驱动的电子健康系统标准化精神科诊断开辟了道路。

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AAW系统的高自主性和广泛应用，需要从质量和安全角度深入理解其运作机制，但目前缺乏评估各智能体对最终输出影响的方法。

Method: 采用反事实分析技术，通过改变特定智能体的输出来观察对最终结果的影响程度，从而评估各智能体的影响力。

Result: 在包含30个用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR能产生一致的排名结果，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务的效果和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估AAW系统中各智能体影响力的方法，具有任务无关性，可在离线和推理时使用，为理解和优化AAW系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个基于强化学习的多轮交互框架，通过训练视觉语言模型作为主动导航智能体来处理长文档理解任务，引入fetch动作和视觉语义锚定机制，在多个长文档基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理需要跨多页分析和整合信息的复杂长文档时表现不佳，传统方法依赖固定推理模板或刚性流程，限制了模型的主动性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ALDEN框架：1）使用多轮强化学习微调VLM作为交互智能体；2）引入fetch动作直接按索引访问页面；3）设计基于规则的跨层级奖励机制；4）提出视觉语义锚定机制解决训练不稳定问题。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的智能体的重要进展，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂城市环境中无人机导航开辟了新途径，有望重塑无人机应用格局。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成独立处理检索块，难以进行多跳或关系推理；知识图谱虽能捕获实体关系但会遗漏不符合三元组结构的信息。

Method: 引入BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上使用基于频率的权重来反映链接强度，应用Hebbian的"一起激发，一起连接"原则。

Result: 减少了信息丢失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率权重非三元组边有效改善了知识图谱的信息捕获能力，提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理咨询LLM方法缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和多会话治疗方法的长期记忆，无法满足真实临床实践需求。

Method: 提出双循环架构：会话内循环负责战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环负责战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中的广泛评估显示，TheraMind在多会话指标（如连贯性、灵活性和治疗协调性）上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 双循环设计在模拟战略、自适应和纵向治疗行为方面有效，验证了其在心理咨询中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

TL;DR: Fortytwo协议利用群体智能和分布式成对排序共识，在AI推理中实现优于多数投票的性能，在GPQA Diamond上达到85.90%准确率，比多数投票提升+17.21个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集中式AI面临计算瓶颈和大型训练收益递减，需要能够水平和垂直扩展的推理层来满足需求。

Method: 采用群体推理方法：基于同行排名、信誉加权的异构模型共识，使用成对排序和Bradley-Terry风格聚合模型，结合链上信誉和抗女巫攻击的能力证明机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优异，GPQA Diamond准确率达85.90%，对抗性提示注入仅退化0.12%，而单模型基线退化6.20%。

Conclusion: 为去中心化AI系统奠定了基础，通过集体智能实现高质量推理的民主化访问，同时保持可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前关于弱到强泛化的理论研究大多局限于抽象框架或线性/随机特征模型，需要在实际CNN架构中提供形式化分析。

Method: 使用梯度下降动态分析，考虑结构化数据（包含不同难度的标签相关信号和标签无关噪声），研究强模型在弱模型标注数据上的训练过程。

Result: 识别了两种机制：数据稀缺机制中泛化通过良性过拟合或有害过拟合发生；数据充足机制中早期通过标签修正实现泛化，但过度训练会降低性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在不同数据机制下呈现不同行为，数据稀缺时依赖过拟合特性，数据充足时早期标签修正有效但需避免过度训练。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在ESP32-S3微控制器上使用低功耗广域网和压缩CNN进行环境监测，证明设备端执行CNN推理并仅传输结果可将能耗降低高达5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境挑战日益严峻，需要设计能够在偏远地区长期运行的节能物联网设备，特别是涉及图像数据的应用。由于数据传输能耗高，在微控制器上直接执行推理可延长物联网节点的使用寿命。

Method: 使用ESP32-S3微控制器，结合低功耗广域网和经过领域特定数据集训练的压缩卷积神经网络，采用后训练量化技术压缩模型。

Result: 设备端执行CNN推理并仅传输结果，相比发送原始图像数据，整体能耗降低了高达5倍。模型量化仅导致精度轻微下降几个百分点。

Conclusion: 这些发现支持开发具有减少碳足迹的物联网应用，通过嵌入式机器学习能够在环境监测场景中自主运行。

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现OOD泛化基准中观察到的ID-OOD准确率正相关可能是聚合异质OOD样本的假象，通过OODSelect方法识别出语义一致的OOD子集，其中ID准确率越高反而OOD准确率越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD泛化基准中ID-OOD准确率的正相关性常被解释为虚假相关性在实践中很少见，但作者怀疑这种模式可能是聚合异质OOD样本造成的假象。

Method: 提出基于梯度的OODSelect方法，识别语义一致的OOD子集，在这些子集中验证ID-OOD准确率关系。

Result: 在广泛使用的分布偏移基准中，OODSelect发现了占标准OOD集一半以上的子集，其中更高的ID准确率预测更低的OOD准确率。

Conclusion: 聚合指标可能掩盖OOD鲁棒性的重要失效模式，需要更细粒度的分析来理解模型在分布偏移下的真实表现。

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多任务EEG分类器，使用GRU-TCN网络结合DQN阈值调整，能够准确分类卒中类型、严重程度和偏侧化，在卒中快速分诊中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中快速分诊需要准确、床旁可部署的工具，EEG有潜力但在一线接触中未充分利用。

Method: 采用自适应多任务EEG分类器，将32通道信号转换为功率谱密度特征，使用GRU-TCN网络预测卒中类型、偏侧化和严重程度，并应用DQN实时调整决策阈值。

Result: 基线GRU-TCN在卒中类型分类上达到89.3%准确率（F1 92.8%），严重程度96.9%（F1 95.9%），偏侧化96.7%（F1 97.4%）；加入DQN阈值适应后，卒中类型准确率提升至98.0%（F1 97.7%）。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值调整可将操作点转移到临床偏好的敏感度-特异性权衡，同时集成的头皮图和频谱可视化支持可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了nnLDA，一种神经增强的概率主题模型，通过神经先验机制动态整合辅助信息，解决了传统主题模型难以整合元数据等侧信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型如LDA难以整合元数据、用户属性或文档标签等辅助信息，限制了其表达能力、个性化和可解释性。

Method: nnLDA将每个文档建模为潜在主题的混合，其中主题比例的先验由基于辅助特征的神经网络生成，开发了随机变分EM算法联合优化神经和概率组件。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，nnLDA在主题一致性、困惑度和下游分类任务中持续优于LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在侧信息可用的场景下，将神经表示学习与概率主题建模相结合具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-GCN是一种快速准确的冰盖建模模拟器，将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络作为图卷积网络的特征校准器，在保持精度的同时提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进冰盖数值模型的模拟器性能，通过KAN前端改善特征条件和非线性编码，而不增加消息传递深度。

Method: 使用KAN作为GCN的特征校准器，应用可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤，在36个融化率模拟数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: 在2-5层架构中，KAN-GCN匹配或超越了纯GCN和MLP-GCN基线的精度，在较粗网格上提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: KAN优先设计为大型瞬态场景扫描提供了有利的精度与效率权衡。

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

TL;DR: 提出了WBT-BGRL框架，通过加权三元组损失增强引导学习，用于二分图的归纳式链接预测，在真实数据集上表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二分图链接预测在推荐系统和故障检测中很重要，但研究较少。对比方法存在负采样效率低和偏差问题，非对比方法仅依赖正样本，现有模型在归纳、加权和二分场景下的有效性未经测试。

Method: 使用双GCN编码器的二分架构，通过新颖的加权机制增强三元组损失的引导学习，是非对比框架。

Result: 在真实数据集（工业和电商）上评估，与适应后的最先进模型相比表现出竞争力，特别是在预训练期间应用加权时效果显著。

Conclusion: 加权非对比学习对二分图归纳式链接预测具有重要价值，WBT-BGRL框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs生成的思维链中许多推理步骤实际上对最终预测没有因果影响，这些装饰性思考步骤只是表面推理，揭示了CoT的可信度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前假设思维链忠实反映模型内部思考过程，但需要验证这些推理步骤是否真正对模型预测有因果贡献。

Method: 提出真实思考分数(TTS)来测量每个推理步骤对最终预测的因果影响，并识别LLMs潜在空间中的真实思考方向。

Result: 只有很少比例的推理步骤具有高TTS值，例如AIME数据集中平均仅2.3%的步骤TTS≥0.7；通过控制真实思考方向可以强制模型执行或忽略特定推理步骤。

Conclusion: LLMs经常口头表达推理步骤而不在内部真正执行，这既降低了推理效率也削弱了CoT的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型存在文化敏感神经元，这些神经元对特定文化背景的输入表现出选择性敏感，其消融会显著影响相应文化的视觉问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型性能出色，但在处理文化相关输入时仍存在困难，需要理解模型如何处理文化背景信息。

Method: 使用CVQA基准识别文化选择性神经元，通过消融实验验证其因果作用，并提出新的基于边界的对比激活选择方法。

Result: 在3个VLMs和25个文化群体上的实验证明，文化敏感神经元的消融会显著损害对应文化的性能，而对其他文化影响很小。

Conclusion: 文化敏感神经元倾向于聚集在某些解码层，这为理解多模态表征的内部组织提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过算法-硬件协同设计的方法，在资源受限平台上实现高效且可靠的神经网络推理，涵盖传统神经网络和贝叶斯神经网络，通过模型压缩、近似贝叶斯推理和硬件优化来平衡效率与不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习在嵌入式等资源受限平台上的计算需求不断增长，制约了可扩展性和效率。神经网络不仅需要高效运行，还需要在分布偏移或未见数据下提供可靠预测。贝叶斯神经网络虽然能提供不确定性量化，但计算开销更大。

Method: 采用算法-硬件协同设计方法：算法层面通过敏感性分析和硬件在环反馈进行自动层特定压缩(Galen)、扩展噪声训练到非平稳条件；硬件层面优化数字加速器部署并探索模拟硬件；开发分析性和集成近似方法替代昂贵采样；引入概率光子计算利用模拟噪声作为内在熵源。

Result: 实现了资源高效且鲁棒的推理，提高了模型在噪声和分布偏移下的稳健性和稳定性，通过编译器堆栈集成和嵌入式推理优化，显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过算法-硬件协同设计可以共同推进效率和可靠性，为下一代可信赖、高能效的机器学习系统奠定基础。

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型固有的低维结构，理解其内在工作机制。

Method: 将语言模型视为序列概率模型，实证分析其对数概率矩阵的低秩特性，并利用线性组合方法进行生成。

Result: 实验证明多种现代语言模型都表现出低秩结构，可以通过线性组合不相关提示的输出来生成目标响应。

Conclusion: 语言模型的低秩结构是一个通用抽象，理论预测与实验结果一致，为理解模型机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Conclusion: 该方法为治疗性抗体发现提供了可扩展的途径，同时直接解决了建模构象不确定性的挑战。

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模机器学习的计算挑战提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散策略在离线强化学习中具有竞争力，但在采样时通常使用缺乏统计风险概念的启发式方法进行引导。

Method: 累积对数似然比，并使用逻辑控制器对条件均值进行门控，该控制器的阈值τ在校准一次后满足用户指定的Type-I水平α。训练保持标准DDPM结构，LRT引导与Q梯度自然组合。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上，LRT-Diffusion在实现所需α的同时，改进了回报-OOD权衡，优于强Q引导基线。

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion是一种即插即用的推理时方法，为离线RL的扩散策略添加了原则性的、校准的风险控制。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Conclusion: 通过变化点分割整合结构先验能够在复杂环境中产生更可解释、样本高效和鲁棒的分层策略。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了矩阵白化优化器，发现方差自适应是解释性能差距的关键因素，而非仅靠准确的光谱归一化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究各种近似矩阵白化变换的优化器，旨在分离解释性能的关键组件，理解为什么矩阵白化方法优于元素级方法如Adam。

Method: 通过实验对比不同矩阵白化优化器的性能，分析光谱归一化和方差自适应两个组件的作用，并测试低秩方差估计器以降低内存成本。

Result: 所有矩阵白化方法都可靠地优于元素级方法；方差自适应版本始终优于符号下降对应方法；低秩方差估计器可在不损失性能的情况下有效减少内存成本。

Conclusion: 矩阵白化优化器的性能优势主要来自方差自适应组件，而非仅靠光谱归一化；低秩方差估计是有效的内存优化策略。

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

TL;DR: SPIRE是一个深度多编码器自编码器，能够将多区域神经记录分解为共享和私有潜在子空间，通过新颖的对齐和解缠损失来恢复跨区域结构并揭示外部扰动如何重组这些结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦共享网络级动态与区域特定活动是多区域神经数据建模的核心挑战，需要开发能够分离共享和私有神经动态的方法。

Method: SPIRE使用深度多编码器自编码器架构，结合新颖的对齐和解缠损失函数，仅使用基线数据进行训练，能够因子化神经记录为共享和私有潜在子空间。

Result: 在具有真实潜在变量的合成基准测试中，SPIRE在非线性扭曲和时间错位下优于经典概率模型。在颅内深部脑刺激记录中，SPIRE显示共享潜在变量可靠地编码了跨位点和频率通用的刺激特异性特征。

Conclusion: SPIRE为分析刺激下多区域神经动态提供了一个实用、可复现的工具，能够可靠地识别跨区域共享的神经动态模式。

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

Motivation: 放射组学模型在实际临床应用中面临成像协议、分割策略等变化导致的分布偏移问题，需要系统评估模型在这些变化下的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用16种水果的体模，评估了五种MRI序列的协议变化、分割变化和观察者间变异性。训练XGBoost分类器，比较协议不变特征与序列特定特征的效果，测试模型在域内和域外条件下的性能。

Result: 使用协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下F1分数>0.85，而使用所有特征的模型在协议变化下性能下降40%。数据增强使预期校准误差降低35%，温度缩放校准效果有限。

Conclusion: 协议感知的特征选择和受控体模研究能有效预测模型在分布偏移下的行为，为开发对现实世界协议变化具有鲁棒性的放射组学模型提供了框架。

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

TL;DR: 提出DWMGrad优化算法，通过动态指导机制自适应调整动量和学习率，解决传统优化算法在处理复杂模型和非凸优化问题时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习研究中，SGD和Adam等优化算法在处理学习效率波动、复杂模型需求和非凸优化问题时存在明显不足，特别是在处理复杂数据结构和模型时面临学习率选择、局部最优和高维空间等挑战。

Method: 基于传统方法基础，引入依赖历史数据的动态指导机制，动态更新动量和学习率，使优化器能够灵活调整对历史信息的依赖，适应不同训练场景。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，DWMGrad在多种场景下能够实现更快的收敛速度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWMGrad算法能够更好地适应变化的环境和任务复杂性，在优化性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Motivation: 现有扰动方法在估计无法访问计算图的网络结构偏导数时存在精度和可扩展性问题，需要开发更有效的方法来支持集成黑盒函数的架构设计。

Method: 提出Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND)扰动方法，通过数值微分技术估计偏导数，适用于无法访问计算图的网络结构。

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法主要关注保留先前任务的性能，但忽略了推荐系统的特殊性：目标不是预测过去偏好，过时的偏好在当前兴趣显著变化时甚至会损害性能。

Method: 提出PESO方法，引入近端正则化器，将当前适配器锚定到其最近的冻结状态，使模型能够灵活平衡适应与保留，更好地捕捉近期用户行为。

Result: 理论上证明该近端设计在LoRA子空间中提供数据感知、方向性指导；实证上PESO始终优于现有的基于LoRA的持续学习方法。

Conclusion: PESO通过近端正则化有效解决了推荐系统中持续学习的独特挑战，在平衡模型适应性和稳定性方面表现出色。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理关系数据时容易放大训练数据偏见，传播歧视性属性和结构不平衡，导致不公平结果。现有公平性方法通常将偏见视为单一来源，忽略了属性和结构效应的区别，导致公平性和效用的次优权衡。

Method: 1. 将图分解为特征、结构和扩散三个视图；2. 使用对比学习最大化跨视图互信息以学习无偏见表示；3. 集成多视角条件信息瓶颈目标，通过最小化与敏感属性的互信息来平衡任务效用和公平性；4. 在扩散视图中引入逆概率加权邻接校正，减少消息传递过程中的偏见传播。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FairMIB在效用和公平性指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FairMIB通过多视角信息瓶颈框架有效缓解了图神经网络中的偏见传播问题，在保持任务效用的同时显著提升了公平性表现。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Motivation: 研究分布偏移对模型性能的影响，挑战传统认为训练测试分布一致最优的观点，探索训练比例不匹配可能带来的性能提升。

Method: 通过理论分析混合分布场景，识别最优训练比例，并扩展到组合设置中不同组件"技能"分布的变化情况。

Result: 证明分布偏移在某些情况下可以是有益的，测试性能可能因训练比例不匹配而改善，确定了最优训练比例和分布偏移的益处程度。

Conclusion: 训练和测试分布的不匹配在某些条件下可能带来性能提升，这为机器学习中的分布偏移问题提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

Conclusion: LRNR架构能够直接从数据中学习双曲波传播的高效低维表示，不仅提供物理可解释性，还具备高效推理能力，在性能要求高的场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强主要用于i.i.d.设置的正则化，但本文旨在将其扩展到跨干预的泛化。由于工具变量在实际应用中不易获得，而数据增强更易获取，因此探索数据增强在因果推断中的潜在应用。

regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Conclusion: 线性嫁接通过消除近似误差来收紧局部Lipschitz常数，是提高认证鲁棒性的有效方法，理论分析为该方法提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于深度时间序列预测的选择性学习策略，通过双掩码机制筛选可泛化的时间步来避免过拟合。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在时间序列预测中容易因噪声和异常值而严重过拟合，传统方法对所有时间步进行统一优化导致模型学习不确定和异常的时间步。

Method: 使用双掩码机制：不确定性掩码利用残差熵过滤不确定时间步，异常掩码使用残差下界估计排除异常时间步，只选择可泛化的时间步子集计算MSE损失。

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了主流深度模型的预测性能，其中Informer的MSE降低了37.4%，TimesNet降低了8.4%，iTransformer降低了6.5%。

Conclusion: 选择性学习策略能有效缓解深度时间序列预测中的过拟合问题，通过专注于可泛化的时间步来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Motivation: 多类PU学习面临无偏风险估计的挑战，现有方法性能受限且不稳定，需要解决在只有正向和未标记数据情况下的多类分类问题。

Method: 在经验风险最小化框架下，为正向和从未标记混合数据中推断出的负向损失分量分配不同的数据依赖权重，确保经验目标是目标风险的无偏估计器。

Result: 在8个公共数据集上的广泛实验显示，在不同类别先验和类别数量下，与强基线相比在准确性和稳定性方面均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应损失加权方法能够有效解决多类PU学习问题，提供无偏风险估计，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSFA是一种新颖的即插即用框架，通过差异缩放不同子空间的更新分量来加速深度学习训练，在主导子空间抑制更新以增强稳定性，在bulk空间放大更新以提升收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习优化中存在基本二分法：沿损失Hessian顶部特征方向的参数更新虽然幅度大但对损失减少贡献小，而bulk空间的更新幅度小但驱动大部分学习进展。

Method: 提出BSFA框架，使用PCA对历史更新进行高效子空间估计，采用分块策略在参数块基础上应用估计，差异缩放不同子空间的更新分量。

Result: 在各种任务中展示加速效果，特别是在WikiText-103上预训练LLaMA-72M和在OpenWebText上预训练LLaMA-134M时，相比原始AdamW实现了约2倍的加速。

Conclusion: BSFA通过有效利用深度学习优化的二分法特性，提供了一种实用且可扩展的加速训练方法。

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Motivation: 现有归一化方法如BatchNorm、LayerNorm和RMSNorm都是方差中心的，强制零均值和单位方差来稳定训练，但没有控制表示如何捕获任务相关信息。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，引入有界压缩操作，鼓励嵌入在保留预测信息的同时抑制无关变异性，同时保持标准归一化的稳定性和兼容性。

Result: 理论上证明IBNorm比方差中心方法获得更高的IB值和更紧的泛化边界。实证上在大型语言模型(LLaMA、GPT-2)和视觉模型(ResNet、ViT)中一致优于现有方法，互信息分析确认了更优的信息瓶颈行为。

Conclusion: IBNorm是一种简单而强大的归一化方法家族，能够产生更具信息量的表示，同时保持训练稳定性和模型兼容性。

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够同时优化期望回报和目标状态上的边际状态分布分散度，具有理论性能保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超图为建模高阶交互提供了自然框架，但半监督学习中超图的理论基础仍然有限，需要研究超图学习的渐近一致性。

Method: 提出高阶超图学习(HOHL)，通过骨架图的拉普拉斯幂进行正则化以实现多尺度平滑，该方法收敛到高阶Sobolev半范数。

Conclusion: 该研究为超图学习提供了理论保证，提出的HOHL方法在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Motivation: 现实任务中的损失函数通常从初始非凸区域过渡到最优解附近的凸区域，这一特性可用于设计更高效的优化算法。

Method: 设计了两阶段优化框架：通过观察梯度范数与损失的关系检测凸性转换点，在非凸区域使用Adam算法，在凸区域使用共轭梯度法。

Result: 计算实验证实该假设在实践中足够普遍，能够显著改善收敛性和准确性。

Conclusion: 利用损失函数的凸性结构转换特性可以设计出更有效的优化算法，在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将PIML成功应用于生物学领域，但生物建模面临多面性先验知识、异构噪声数据、部分可观测性和高维网络等独特挑战。

Method: 提出BIML框架，在保留PIML结构基础的同时适应生物学实际需求，通过不确定性量化、情境化、约束潜在结构推断和可扩展性四大支柱进行扩展。

Result: BIML将PIML方法重新工具化，使其能在更软、概率形式的先验知识下运行，基础模型和大型语言模型将成为关键推动者。

Conclusion: 为构建BIML生态系统提供具体建议，引导PIML启发创新解决高科学和社会相关性的挑战。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

Conclusion: 这项工作为跨多个算子的可扩展神经算子学习建立了统一的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化需要针对每个应用领域进行参数调优，而现有大语言模型在连续黑盒优化任务上能力有限，需要开发一种无需调优且具有泛化能力的优化方法。

Conclusion: GPTOpt为全局优化提供了一个无需参数调优的灵活框架，证明了LLM在连续黑盒优化任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Conclusion: 效用校准为多分类校准评估提供了可扩展且通用的框架，能够根据具体应用需求定制校准评估标准。

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Motivation: 在深度学习领域，需要鲁棒的验证指标来检测过拟合、监控训练动态和泛化能力，同时希望直接从训练数据中获取这些信息。

Method: 引入梯度权重对齐(GWA)方法，计算每个样本梯度与模型权重之间的一致性，有效学习对应一致的对齐，而错位则表明泛化能力下降。

Result: 实验表明GWA能准确预测最优早停点，支持原则性模型比较，识别有影响力的训练样本，提供了一种无需验证集的模型分析方法。

Conclusion: GWA是一种高效的训练中可计算指标，能够反映样本特定贡献和数据集范围的学习动态，为模型分析提供了基于训练数据的验证集无关方法。

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in
efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing
synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully

state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,

Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast

existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,
providing a reproducible foundation for future research.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更忠实、一致和可解释的概念解释，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的图结构学习方法在理论分析上仅限于树状图（每个节点只有一个父节点），难以扩展到更一般的多父节点DAG图。需要设计新的训练目标，使不同的注意力头能够分别学习多个不同的父子依赖关系。

Method: 提出基于f-散度的核引导互信息（KG-MI）度量，结合多头注意力框架，每个头关联不同的边际转移核来建模多样化的父子依赖关系。

Result: 理论证明：对于K-父节点DAG生成的序列，通过梯度上升训练单层多头transformer能在多项式时间内收敛到全局最优解。当f-散度特化为KL散度时，学习到的注意力分数能准确反映真实邻接矩阵，从而可证明地恢复底层图结构。

Conclusion: 该方法首次为多头注意力机制在多父节点DAG图结构学习中的训练动态提供了理论保证，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单假设保证的统一框架，包括通用oracle界限、数值界限和多数投票特化，实验显示在确定性分类器的泛化界限上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典PAC-Bayes框架只能提供随机采样假设的期望风险保证，需要测试时的随机预测，这限制了其在需要部署单一确定性假设的实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了统一框架，包括通用oracle界限、数值界限和多数投票特化方法，用于从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单假设保证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在确定性分类器的泛化界限上始终优于流行基线方法，性能提升可达2倍。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了PAC-Bayes在确定性假设部署场景中的局限性，提供了有效的单假设泛化保证。

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了低秩伪逆在噪声环境下的谱范数鲁棒性，推导了尖锐的非渐近扰动界限，揭示了误差如何随特征间隙、谱衰减和噪声对齐而缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的矩阵通常带有噪声，但低秩逆近似的谱范数鲁棒性仍未被充分理解，需要系统研究噪声环境下低秩逆近似的稳定性。

Method: 引入轮廓积分技术的新应用，针对非全纯函数f(z)=1/z，在温和的噪声假设下推导非渐近扰动界限。

Result: 提出的界限比经典全逆界限的简单适应提高了高达√n倍，经验验证表明新界限能紧密跟踪真实扰动误差，而基于经典结果的估计往往显著高估。

Conclusion: 这些发现为噪声计算环境中的低秩逆近似提供了实用的、频谱感知的保证，改进了现有理论框架。

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM方法，通过Musielak正则化将复杂优化问题简化为单变量优化，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Sobolev IPM受限于L^p几何结构，无法融入其他结构先验。需要一种更灵活的几何结构框架来克服这一限制。

Method: 通过Orlicz几何结构推广Sobolev IPM，建立Orlicz-Sobolev范数与Musielak范数的理论联系，并利用图结构将优化问题简化为单变量优化。

Result: GSI-M方法比流行的OW方法快几个数量级，在文档分类和拓扑数据分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的GSI-M框架不仅包含经典Sobolev IPM作为特例，还能适应多样化的几何先验，同时实现了计算效率的显著提升。

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

TL;DR: 提出基于SVD分解的结构化局部学习框架，在低秩流形上训练深度神经网络，减少参数数量同时保持与反向传播相当的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播全局误差传播和全参数化带来的内存计算开销问题，以及直接反馈对齐方法在深度卷积网络中反馈结构化和可扩展性不足的局限

Method: 在SVD分解的权重矩阵低秩流形上进行局部学习，对SVD分量应用包含交叉熵、子空间对齐和正交正则化的复合损失函数，构建与SVD结构匹配的反馈矩阵

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上达到与反向传播相当的准确率，且无需依赖剪枝或后处理压缩即可减少可训练参数数量

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的局部学习为全秩梯度训练提供了原理性且可扩展的替代方案

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Result: 实验证明这些度量在下游任务中有效，并揭示了不同实现之间的权衡关系

Conclusion: 该框架为回归任务的不确定性量化提供了统一的理论基础和实用的设计指南

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了FP和INT量化格式在不同粒度下的性能，发现FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，但在细粒度量化中MXINT8在算法精度和硬件效率上更优。4位格式中FP通常有精度优势，但结合异常值缓解技术后NVINT4可超越NVFP4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI硬件越来越多地采用低精度FP格式处理LLM中的激活异常值，但缺乏FP和INT量化在不同粒度下的统一比较，导致算法和硬件协同设计缺乏明确指导。

Method: 系统研究FP和INT格式的权衡，包括不同粒度（粗粒度和细粒度）和位宽（8位和4位）的比较，引入对称裁剪方法解决细粒度低比特INT训练中的梯度偏差问题。

Result: 发现性能临界点：FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，但在细粒度8位格式中MXINT8在算法精度和硬件效率上优于FP对应格式；4位格式中FP通常有精度优势，但结合Hadamard旋转等异常值缓解技术后NVINT4可超越NVFP4。

Conclusion: 挑战当前硬件发展轨迹，证明一刀切的FP方法不是最优选择，主张细粒度INT格式（特别是MXINT8）为未来AI加速器提供了更好的精度、功耗和效率平衡。

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Motivation: 改进WGAN框架的训练稳定性，通过BOLT原理增强GAN训练效果。

Method: 在WGAN框架基础上引入BOLT原理，使用Lipschitz连续判别器，隐式最小化不同于Wasserstein距离的度量距离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CelebA-64、LSUN Bedroom-64和LSUN Church-64四个基准测试中，BOLT-GAN的FID比WGAN降低10-60%。

Conclusion: BOLT是一个广泛适用的增强GAN训练的原则，BOLT-GAN在训练稳定性和生成质量上均优于WGAN。

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Conclusion: 该分析阐明了动作微调与视觉语言表示退化之间的权衡关系，并强调了恢复继承的视觉语言能力的实用方法。

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中图结构数据的挑战，特别是互联子图场景，现有方法存在隐私风险或计算复杂度高的问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedLap相比现有技术实现了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: FedLap是首个具有强隐私保证的子图联邦学习方案，在保持隐私的同时实现了良好的性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的对称矩阵谱范数扰动边界，改进了经典的Eckart-Young-Mirsky定理，并在差分隐私PCA中获得了改进的效用保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中需要理解噪声或测量误差如何影响低秩近似，特别是在谱范数下。现有工作多分析Frobenius范数误差，但谱范数能捕捉最坏情况的方向误差并提供最强的效用保证。

Method: 使用复分析中的轮廓自举方法，并将其扩展到包括多项式和矩阵指数在内的广泛谱函数类，建立了高概率的谱范数扰动边界。

Result: 在温和的特征值间隙和范数条件下，新边界对‖(A+E)_p - A_p‖给出了尖锐估计，改进因子可达√n，并在差分隐私PCA中获得了改进的效用保证。

Conclusion: 提出的谱范数扰动边界改进了经典结果，解决了文献中的一个开放问题，并在真实数据集上验证了边界能紧密跟踪实际谱误差。

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNNs主要处理简单、确定性行为，而自然行为具有更丰富、自发和随机特性。HMMs揭示了自然行为的分段离散状态转换，这与RNNs的连续状态空间看似矛盾。

Method: 首先训练RNNs复制HMM发射统计，然后逆向工程分析训练后的网络机制。在无输入时网络活动收敛到固定点，在随机输入驱动下则表现出噪声维持的闭合轨道动力学。

Result: 训练后的RNNs发展出高度结构化的连接性，具有少量"踢神经元"在慢速噪声驱动区域间引发快速确定性转换。这种机制在训练中通过随机共振实现概率计算。

Conclusion: 该解决方案通过模块化重用相同的动力学模式在不同HMM架构中通用，表明RNNs可以通过组合原理模拟复杂离散潜在动力学。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Conclusion: 具有物理一致性更新规则的局部保持GNN是动态、波主导结构模拟的有竞争力替代方案，在保持时空保真度的同时实现显著推理加速

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

*Ethan Harvey,Dennis Johan Loevlie,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文设计了一个合成分类任务，证明传统多实例学习方法忽略相邻实例间的关系，导致性能受限，即使新方法也难以达到最优贝叶斯估计器的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多实例学习方法在处理医学图像时，将实例分开处理，忽略了相邻切片或图像块之间的上下文关系，而这些关系在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个合成分类任务，其中相邻实例的特征对准确预测至关重要，并将现有多实例学习方法与可获得闭式解的最优贝叶斯估计器进行比较。

Result: 实证表明，即使使用较新的相关多实例学习方法，在从数万个实例从头训练时，仍难以达到最优贝叶斯估计器的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 当前多实例学习方法在处理需要利用相邻实例关系的任务时存在局限性，需要开发能够更好捕捉上下文关系的新方法。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了神经随机流（NSFs）及其潜在变体，通过条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，实现任意时间点的一次性采样，相比传统数值方法可获得两个数量级的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机微分方程建模方法在任意时间点采样时需要昂贵的数值求解器，计算成本高。

Method: 使用具有架构约束的条件归一化流来学习（潜在）SDE转移规律，保持随机流的继承特性。

Result: 在大时间间隔下实现高达两个数量级的加速，同时在合成SDE模拟和真实世界跟踪、视频数据上保持与数值方法相当的分布准确性。

Conclusion: NSFs能够在保持分布准确性的同时，显著降低任意时间点采样的计算成本。

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.
