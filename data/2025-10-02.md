### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的新型自包含遗忘学习方法，用于大语言模型，无需依赖外部资源即可有效移除训练数据子集的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘学习方法通常需要辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这在实践中不切实际且可能引入额外隐私风险。

Method: 通过识别目标令牌（用于优化遗忘目标）和非目标令牌（用于保持模型效用），直接在令牌级别优化目标函数。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO相比最新基线方法在遗忘质量上实现了高达16.8倍的提升，同时保持可比较的模型效用水平。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效且实用的LLM遗忘学习方法，无需外部资源即可实现高质量的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

### [2] [TAMA: Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Procedural Activity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00161)
*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TAMA框架，一种工具增强的多模态代理，用于程序性活动理解，通过多媒体返回工具实现训练免费的多模态推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性活动助手在日常生活和专业场景中具有广泛应用潜力，但相关系统开发仍处于探索不足状态

Method: 使用多媒体返回工具实现交错多模态推理，在训练免费设置下工作，具备灵活工具选择能力

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly数据集上提升了视觉语言模型（特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL）的性能，消融研究验证了多媒体返回工具和灵活工具选择的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架促进了视频和多模态任务的图像思维范式，推动了程序性活动助手的发展

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

### [3] [DRBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Enterprise Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00172)
*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Tianyi Chen,Miguel Muñoz-Mármol,Curtis Fox,Amrutha Varshini Ramesh,Étienne Marcotte,Xing Han Lù,Nicolas Chapados,Spandana Gella,Christopher Pal,Alexandre Drouin,Issam H. Laradji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench是一个用于评估AI代理在企业环境中执行复杂、开放式深度研究任务的基准测试，涵盖多步骤查询、异构搜索空间和真实企业场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注简单问题或仅基于网络的查询，缺乏对企业环境中复杂深度研究任务的评估能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流程生成任务，结合人工验证，评估代理从公共网络和私有知识库中识别相关事实、保持事实准确性并生成结构化报告的能力。

Result: 发布了涵盖10个领域的15个深度研究任务，评估了多种开源和闭源模型，揭示了不同DR策略的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: DRBench为推进企业深度研究提供了关键路径，展示了AI代理在复杂企业环境中的评估框架和性能表现。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrimeX是一个包含858名美国居民公众意见调查数据的数据集，额外收集了受访者的书面解释和世界观信息，用于研究语言模型的个性化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型的广泛应用，需要更好地表示个体用户特征。研究探索是否可以利用个体信念系统来改进语言模型的对齐效果。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，包含公众意见调查数据、受访者书面解释和Primal World Belief世界观调查，分析这些额外信念信息对语言模型个性化的价值。

Result: 研究展示了PrimeX中额外信念信息对个性化语言模型的益处，证明了书面解释和世界观信息的重要价值。

Conclusion: PrimeX数据集为NLP和心理学研究社区提供了有价值的资源，开辟了进一步研究的途径，展示了信念信息在语言模型个性化中的重要作用。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估方法，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，使用心理学基础的用户角色来评估LLM的个性化推理能力。研究发现29%的个性化尝试比通用回答更差，表明个性化推理需要专门开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐分开处理，但在面向人类的应用中，正确解决问题还不够，需要匹配用户需求。特别是在冷启动或隐私限制下，LLM需要识别未知偏好、策略性提问并相应调整推理过程。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估方法，使用心理学基础的用户角色和稀疏偏好，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务。创建相同问题需要不同推理链的场景，根据用户专业知识和偏好调整解释方法。

Result: 评估21个前沿模型在10个任务上的表现，发现29.0%的朴素个性化尝试比通用回答产生更差的偏好对齐，而通用回答也无法有效服务个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发而非自然涌现。PREFDISCO将个性化推理确立为可衡量的研究前沿，揭示了当前LLM交互能力的根本限制，为开发适应个体用户的系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BiasFreeBench基准，用于统一评估LLM去偏方法，包含8种主流技术、两种测试场景和新的响应级指标Bias-Free Score。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法评估使用不同基线和指标，导致比较不一致，且基于概率比较而非实际用户交互场景。

Method: 重新组织现有数据集为统一查询-响应设置，比较4种提示方法和4种训练方法，在多选QA和开放式多轮QA场景下测试。

Result: 系统比较了提示与训练范式、模型大小以及训练策略对未见偏见的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立统一测试平台，促进去偏研究的公平比较和实际应用。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASER是一种基于大型推理模型的翻译质量评估指标，通过系统化推理实现翻译评估，在WMT24评测中取得了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性和透明度，需要开发结合准确性和透明度的评估方法。

Method: 利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力，采用结构化提示模板进行系统化、分步骤的翻译质量评估。

Result: 在系统级评估中，TASER在有参考和无参考设置下都获得了最高的软配对准确率；在片段级评估中，无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面显示出可衡量的进步，结合了改进的准确性和跨语言对的透明评估。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261)
*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于心电图文语言模型的开源检索增强生成管道，通过实验证明RAG能持续提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对心电图文语言模型的RAG开源实现和系统研究，而RAG能减少幻觉并改善自然语言生成质量。

Method: 开发了基于检索增强生成的心电图文语言模型管道，包含基线模型和消融研究，在三个公开数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，使用RAG的心电图文语言模型在性能上持续优于非RAG基线，并揭示了关键的设计考虑因素。

Conclusion: 成功实现了首个开源的心电图文语言模型RAG管道，为相关研究提供了基准和设计指导。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出校准概率自动评分器的方法，使其能够建模目标人群的完整偏好分布，解决传统基于离散标签训练的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自动评分器存在根本问题：它们基于离散偏好标签训练，但许多任务具有主观性、模糊性或细微差别，需要建模完整的偏好分布。

Method: 提出通用框架校准概率自动评分器，包含两种学习方法：1）对有密集概率标签的数据进行直接监督微调；2）对稀疏二元标签使用强化学习方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用分布匹配目标微调的自动评分器能产生与目标偏好分布更好对齐的言语化概率预测，改善校准度，显著降低位置偏差，同时在客观任务上保持性能。

Conclusion: 通过校准概率自动评分器来建模完整偏好分布，能够提高其在主观任务上的可靠性，同时保持客观任务的性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IR-Tuning：一种基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要层进行参数高效微调的框架，用于提升LLM在文本修订分类任务中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本生成任务中表现出色，但在文本分类任务中潜力未被充分挖掘，特别是对于文本修订这种需要细微分类的任务。传统微调方法需要大量标注数据，但这些数据昂贵且稀缺。

Method: 提出IR-Tuning框架，基于梯度范数分布动态选择LLM中的重要层进行参数高效微调，同时冻结冗余层，实现插件式的层间PEFT方法。

Result: IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务中超越了多个层间PEFT基线方法，实现了快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗，并在小规模修订语料上表现有效。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为LLM在文本修订分类任务中提供了一种高效且有效的微调解决方案，解决了标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

### [11] [SafePassage: High-Fidelity Information Extraction with Black Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00276)
*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafePassage是一个三步骤的信息提取管道，通过生成基于文档的"安全段落"来减少LLM幻觉，可将幻觉减少高达85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒大语言模型使信息提取易于配置但难以信任，提取的信息不能保证基于文档，需要防止幻觉问题。

Method: 采用三步骤管道：(1) LLM提取器生成结构化实体及其上下文，(2) 基于字符串的全局对齐器，(3) 评分模型。

Result: 使用SafePassage可将信息提取任务中的幻觉减少高达85%，且与人类判断高度一致。微调的transformer编码器在标记不安全段落方面优于LLM评分模型。

Conclusion: SafePassage能有效减少LLM幻觉，可用于评估LLM，且任务特定的小样本微调模型表现优于LLM评分器。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个临床基础的元评估框架，重新思考放射学报告生成评估指标的设计和评估，揭示现有指标在临床语义解释上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成的放射学报告在现有评估指标上得分很高，但无法获得临床医生的信任，这表明当前评估生成报告质量的指标存在根本性缺陷。

Method: 定义临床基础的标准，涵盖临床对齐和关键指标能力，包括区分度、鲁棒性和单调性。使用细粒度标注的数据集系统评估现有指标。

Result: 揭示现有指标在解释临床语义方面的局限性：无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变异、在错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更临床可靠的评估方法提供指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的语言模型在NLP领域带来革命性进步，但同时也引入了模型透明度和可信度的重大挑战。研究人员开发了大量解释方法和评估指标，使得选择最佳可解释性方法变得复杂。

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

### [14] [CORTEX: Collaborative LLM Agents for High-Stakes Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00311)
*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个多智能体LLM架构，用于安全运营中心的高风险警报分类，通过专业化智能体协作处理企业安全警报，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心每天面临数万条警报，其中只有一小部分是真实攻击，导致警报疲劳、威胁遗漏和分析师倦怠。现有方法要么脆弱且缺乏上下文，要么依赖单一模型处理整个流程，难以应对嘈杂的企业数据且透明度有限。

Method: 提出CORTEX多智能体LLM架构，包含专门化的智能体：行为分析智能体检查活动序列，证据收集智能体查询外部系统，推理智能体将发现综合为可审计的决策。

Result: 在多样化的企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM方法，显著减少了误报并提高了调查质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作架构在安全警报分类中优于单一模型方法，提供了更好的性能和可审计性。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型过度依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，但这种依赖效率低下，提示需要在每个步骤重新读取，跨任务扩展性差，且缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem令牌化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入。每个记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号，引导生成过程。保持骨干模型冻结，支持持续添加新程序而不干扰现有程序。

Result: 在1000个原子回忆任务和函数调用组合回忆任务上评估，TokMem始终优于检索增强生成，避免了重复上下文开销，且使用更少参数进行微调。

Conclusion: TokMem为LLMs提供了可扩展和模块化的替代方案，取代提示工程和微调，提供了显式的程序记忆机制。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专为代码LLM设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略显著减少上下文长度，在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文剪枝技术（如LLMLingua）在通用文本上表现良好，但忽略了代码特定的结构和依赖关系，导致在编程任务中性能不佳。高API成本和生成延迟是代码LLM处理长上下文的主要瓶颈。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩，基于条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，仅保留最相关函数；2）细粒度压缩，将保留函数按困惑度分段，在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、摘要和问答等多个任务上的评估显示，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在不降低任务性能的情况下实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: LongCodeZip通过有效减少上下文大小同时保留关键信息，使LLM能够更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，而评分预测这一需要语言和数学推理的回归任务在工业应用中很重要，但大语言模型在这方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用八个现成大语言模型在三个数据集上进行全面实验，提供不同的上下文信息，包括用户评论和偏好描述，并尝试让模型先生成假设性评论。

Result: 用户评论显著提升LLMs的评分预测性能，效果与矩阵分解方法相当；具体物品的评论比一般偏好描述更有效；先生成假设性评论能进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 现成大语言模型在评分预测任务上表现出色，用户评论是关键因素，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Conclusion: 代理微调是提升大语言模型在专业微领域中推理能力的有效方法，特别是在复杂技术领域如IT运维中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

Motivation: 现有GUI多模态代理在复杂或跨域任务中可靠性有限，需要探究其是否存在伪推理问题。

Method: 提出Agent-ScanKit系统探测框架，包含视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导三种正交探测范式，在无需访问模型内部的情况下量化记忆与推理贡献。

Result: 在5个公开GUI基准测试中评估18个多模态代理，结果显示机械记忆通常超过系统推理，模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 多模态代理需要更强大的推理建模才能在现实场景中可靠工作，为开发可靠多模态代理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音对话系统依赖级联流水线，会丢弃副语言线索并限制表达性；现有的端到端方法虽然减少了延迟但依然依赖文本中间表示，形成根本瓶颈。

Method: 结合基于模态的层分割架构和冻结预训练策略，在保留预训练文本LLM推理能力和知识的同时增加原生语音能力。

Result: 在口语问答任务上达到最先进结果，在语音到语音性能上与现有文本引导系统相当，同时保持竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导和直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，以全面评估智能体的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的合成数据方法主要针对LLM训练和评估设计，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的智能体任务。静态数据集无法充分评估智能体在动态环境和多样化任务中的真实能力。

Method: 使用多源外部数据构建知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道来保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: 构建了Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景的任务。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分智能体和模型性能的任务，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互方面的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为智能体评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多种智能体类型（单智能体、多智能体、网页智能体）的推理、协作和交互能力。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出CopyPasteLLM，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练来解决RAG中的上下文忠实性问题，发现高复制度响应能显著减少幻觉，仅需少量训练数据即可在多个基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG虽然能让LLM生成基于上下文的响应，但上下文忠实性仍然是个挑战，LLM可能不信任提供的上下文，导致幻觉问题影响可靠性。研究发现响应复制程度与上下文不忠实幻觉呈负相关。

Method: 提出CopyPasteLLM，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练获得。设计了三种提示方法来增强复制程度，构建全自动流水线将生成响应转化为高复制偏好数据用于训练。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上，CopyPasteLLM在反事实和原始上下文中均表现最佳，在FaithEval上比最佳基线提升12.2%到24.5%的准确率，仅需365个训练样本（基线数据的1/50）。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识来提升上下文忠实性，高复制度响应是实现更好幻觉控制的有效策略。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for

propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,

multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance

Method: 开发了包含媒体检索和两阶段对齐算法的可扩展流程，专门设计用于处理非逐字记录和长音频，应用于22个欧洲议会的录音。

Result: 提取了超过61k小时的对齐语音片段，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时，在现有ASR模型上微调后实现了平均41.8%的词错误率降低。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多语言语音数据稀缺问题，显著提升了语音识别性能，证明了从议会录音构建大规模高质量语音数据集的可行性。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练阶段，传统的负对数似然(NLL)目标在模型能力较强时表现不佳，提出应根据模型能力连续体选择不同的概率目标函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)是后训练LLMs的标准方法，但其泛化能力有限。作者认为这是因为NLL目标在后训练阶段可能不再最优，因为模型已经编码了任务相关的先验知识，且监督信号可能冗长嘈杂。

Method: 研究了一族基于概率的目标函数，通过7个模型主干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验，分析了模型能力连续体对目标函数效果的影响。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体是决定目标函数效果的关键维度：在模型能力强的区域，倾向于先验的目标函数(如$-p$, $-p^{10}$等)优于NLL；在模型能力弱的区域，NLL占优；中间区域没有单一最优目标。

Conclusion: 应根据模型能力选择合适的目标函数，为后训练阶段的目标函数选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is
available at https://github.com/GaotangLi/Beyond-Log-Likelihood.

<details>

Motivation: GUI代理在处理高分辨率截图和长时程任务时面临效率挑战，现有缓存压缩方法未能充分考虑GUI的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合两种新技术：空间显著性引导（用隐藏状态的L2范数增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（将历史帧的键投影到当前帧的键子空间来优先剪枝冗余历史）。

Result: 在标准GUI代理基准测试中，GUI-KV优于竞争基线，在适度预算下接近全缓存精度。在AgentNetBench基准测试中，解码FLOPs减少38.9%，步骤准确率提高4.1%。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定的冗余特性可以实现高效可靠的代理性能。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用时经常过度思考：它们已经达到正确的工具参数配置，但继续推理并用错误的最终调用覆盖它。这种过度思考问题在工具推理领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过oracle rollouts在句子边界注入</think>来诊断过度思考问题，并提出了ThinkBrake方法——一种无需训练的解码启发式方法，在句子边界监控</think>与当前top token之间的log-probability margin，当margin变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard上，oracle终止将平均准确率从85.8%提升到94.2%，同时减少80-94%的token。ThinkBrake在单轮、非实时和实时分割中保持或提高准确率，同时减少高达25%的token，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 过度思考是小推理模型在工具使用中的重要问题，ThinkBrake提供了一种有效的训练无关解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

Method: 构建CHIME数据集，包含中文网络流行语的详细标注信息；设计两个评估任务：解释任务（解释含义、识别起源、生成例句）和选择题任务（在上下文中选择合适流行语填空）。

Result: LLMs能够解释部分流行语的含义，但对文化和语言细微差别的流行语类型表现显著下降；在追溯起源方面持续困难；在选择题任务中表现正确但明显低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力有限，特别是在文化背景和起源追溯方面存在明显不足，CHIME数据集将为计算流行语理解研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSeek是一个基于强化学习的自校正搜索代理框架，通过引入JUDGE动作和密集过程奖励函数，使代理能够动态识别和纠正错误搜索路径，显著提升任务成功率和路径忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理方法依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，容易导致代理陷入次优或错误的推理路径而无法恢复。

Method: 提出ReSeek自校正框架，包含JUDGE动作机制让代理动态判断信息并重新规划搜索策略，设计了密集的过程奖励函数（正确性奖励和实用性奖励），并创建了FictionalHot基准数据集以避免数据污染问题。

Result: 实验表明，使用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSeek框架通过自校正机制和密集过程奖励，有效解决了搜索代理在复杂推理任务中的路径错误问题，提升了搜索性能。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CoT Vectors方法，通过紧凑的向量表示编码多步推理知识，相比现有方法成本更低、效率更高，性能可与参数高效微调方法相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法（如上下文学习和微调）成本高且效率低，需要开发更经济高效的CoT推理增强方法。

Method: 提出CoT Vectors方法：1）提取式CoT Vectors揭示层间不稳定性；2）可学习CoT Vectors在师生框架下优化，提供更稳定的指导。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的广泛评估表明，CoT Vectors不仅优于现有基线，而且性能与参数高效微调方法相当，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT Vectors不仅是一种有效的推理增强方法，还可作为探针揭示LLM中多步推理的功能组织机制，包括潜在空间结构、信息密度、获取机制和预训练差异等因素的影响。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Method: 结合基于可学习查询的多语言感知架构，在大规模模拟代码切换数据上进行预训练。

Result: 在多个语言分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，相对性能提升23%至52%。

Conclusion: 不仅推进了语言分割研究，还为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie是一种低资源的藏缅语系语言，此前没有音节划分的研究工作。音节划分是NLP中的重要任务，对形态分析、词性标注等应用至关重要。

Method: 创建了10,120个音节化词汇的数据集，应用了LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器四种深度学习架构，数据集按80:10:10划分训练集、验证集和测试集。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie语言音节划分任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言的NLP应用奠定了基础，所创建的数据集和模型可用于形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等下游任务。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MCM-DPO方法，通过多维度跨模态直接偏好优化来改进替代文本生成，无需精确标注，在替代文本生成任务中超越了DPO和SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代文本生成任务面临用户标注噪声、标准不一致以及多模态大语言模型对上下文信息不敏感的问题，而监督微调依赖准确的目标标注，这在用户生成的替代文本中往往存在缺陷。

Method: 提出了多维度跨模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，在偏好对中学习识别更好的选项，无需精确标注。该方法在单维度、配对维度和多偏好维度上优化偏好，涵盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素。

Result: 实验结果表明，MCM-DPO方法在替代文本生成任务中一致优于DPO和SFT方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MCM-DPO方法通过多维度偏好优化有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，为盲人和低视力用户提供了更好的图像描述服务。

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究使用大型语言模型自动生成易读文本，提出了多任务学习方法，结合文本摘要、文本简化和易读文本生成，在Mistral-7B和LLaMA-3-8B模型上验证了多任务设置优于单任务基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为神经多样性人群提供信息平等访问，解决手动创建易读文本耗时耗力的问题，利用LLM自动化生成易读内容。

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，包括基于检索增强生成的多任务RAG策略和参数高效微调的MTL-LoRA策略，在ETR-fr新数据集上进行实验。

Result: 多任务设置在所有配置中均优于单任务基线，RAG策略在领域外设置中具有泛化能力，MTL-LoRA在领域内配置中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多任务学习能有效提升易读文本生成质量，不同策略在不同场景下各有优势，为自动化易读内容生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Motivation: 为认知障碍者提供可访问性至关重要，但手动ETR文本适应缓慢、成本高且难以扩展，AI驱动的ETR生成提供了可扩展解决方案，但面临数据集稀缺、领域适应和平衡LLMs轻量学习等挑战。

Method: 引入ETR-fr数据集，实施参数高效微调在PLMs和LLMs上建立生成基线，并引入基于自动指标和人工评估的评估框架，后者使用与指南对齐的36问题评估表。

Result: 总体结果显示PLMs与LLMs表现相当，并能有效适应域外文本。

Conclusion: ETR-fr数据集和参数高效微调方法为ETR文本生成提供了可行的解决方案，PLMs在性能和适应性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

TL;DR: ALARB是一个阿拉伯语法律推理数据集，包含13K+沙特商业法庭案例，用于评估LLMs在法律领域的多步推理能力，并通过指令微调显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准主要关注检索和理解任务，缺乏专门针对多步推理的开放语境数据集，特别是在法律领域。

Method: 构建包含案件事实、法庭推理、判决结果和引用条款的数据集，定义判决预测、推理链补全和相关法规识别等任务，并对阿拉伯语LLMs进行基准测试和指令微调。

Result: 使用ALARB对12B参数模型进行指令微调后，在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成任务上表现显著提升，达到与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集有效填补了阿拉伯语法律推理评估的空白，证明了其在提升LLMs法律推理能力方面的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 该研究探索如何将小型高效LLM适配到低资源语言法罗语，通过从英语模型出发，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练，然后对法罗语进行微调，比较了全参数微调和LoRA参数高效微调的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言法罗语的LLM适配问题，缺乏现有评估数据，需要构建新的评估基准。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练（单独或合并），然后对法罗语进行微调，比较全参数微调和LoRA方法，构建新的最小对基准测试并进行人工评估。

Result: 相关语言迁移至关重要，但最佳源语言因任务而异：冰岛语提升语言准确性，丹麦语增强理解能力；LoRA和全参数微调的选择也取决于任务：LoRA提高语言可接受性，全参数微调在理解任务上表现更好且在下游微调中更好地保留模型能力。

Conclusion: 低资源语言适配需要根据具体任务选择最优的源语言和微调方法，相关语言迁移是关键策略。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Motivation: 评估检索增强LLM机器翻译在真实世界噪声检索环境下的鲁棒性，这是实际部署中的常见挑战。

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新评估指标，使用Qwen系列模型（包括标准LLM和增强推理的大推理模型）在高中低资源语言对上评估习语翻译性能。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下性能下降更严重，常产生无意义翻译；大推理模型在纠错方面无改进，反而更易受噪声影响并合理化错误上下文；注意力从源习语转向噪声内容，置信度增加但准确性下降。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，需要在性能和鲁棒性之间权衡，迫切需要自验证集成机制来解决这些问题。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

TL;DR: ManagerBench是一个评估LLM在管理场景中安全决策能力的基准测试，通过真实的人类验证场景测试模型在操作目标与安全价值冲突时的选择倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，但忽视了当实现操作目标的最有效路径与人类安全冲突时，智能体可能采取有害行动的问题。

Method: 创建包含现实管理场景的基准测试，每个场景都要求在实现操作目标的务实但有害行动与安全但操作性能较差的行动之间做出选择，并设置平行对照组来测量模型的务实倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全与务实权衡方面表现不佳：许多模型为推进操作目标持续选择有害选项，而其他模型则过度安全且无效。关键发现是这种错位并非源于无法感知危害，而是源于优先级排序的缺陷。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估智能体行为核心组件的具有挑战性的基准：当操作目标和对齐价值激励冲突行动时做出安全选择的能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

TL;DR: 提出了可擦除强化学习（ERL）框架，通过识别、擦除和重新生成错误推理步骤，解决多跳推理中的分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误问题，显著提升了搜索增强LLM在复杂推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强的大型语言模型在复杂多跳推理中的可靠性有限，主要面临三个挑战：分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误，任一阶段的失败都会影响最终答案。

Method: 提出可擦除强化学习（ERL）框架，能够明确识别错误步骤、擦除它们并在原位置重新生成推理，防止错误逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的模型在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle等基准测试中取得显著提升，3B模型相对之前SOTA提升了8.48% EM和11.56% F1，7B模型提升了5.38% EM和7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为LLM中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变，能够将脆弱的推理过程转变为更稳健的过程。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 结合(i)基于FineWeb构建的领域无关合成数据集，通过多阶段筛选和数据重构优化；(ii)合成的基础声明和幻觉声明；(iii)使用几率比偏好优化的偏好微调，将大模型推理能力蒸馏到小模型骨干中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与MiniCheck(7B)和Granite Guardian 3.3(8B)等更大专业模型相当；在整个基准测试中达到75.7%的平衡准确率，与GPT-4o(75.9%)相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard证明了通过精心设计的合成数据生成和偏好优化，小型模型可以在幻觉检测任务上达到与更大模型相当的性能，为构建可信的RAG系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet是一个用于检测学术文本中AI生成内容的结构感知框架，通过结合分段条件风格建模和多层次对比学习，实现跨领域的精确检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学写作中的快速应用引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧，现有检测方法存在局限性。

Method: 结合分段条件风格建模与多层次对比学习，集成BIO-CRF序列标注和基于指针的边界解码，以及置信度校准。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet达到最先进性能：F1(AI)为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36。

Conclusion: 该框架在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，在不同学科和IMRaD部分保持平衡准确度，显著超越现有基线方法。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RAG与基础模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在专家级推理（如解决奥林匹克级物理问题）方面的能力尚未充分探索。受学生通过复习过往问题准备竞赛的启发，研究RAG增强基础模型物理推理的潜力。

Method: 引入PhoPile多模态数据集，专门针对奥林匹克级物理设计，包含图表、图形和方程。使用该数据集对RAG增强的基础模型进行基准测试，涵盖大型语言模型和多模态模型，并采用多种检索器。

Result: 结果表明，将检索与物理语料库集成可以提高模型性能，但也凸显了在检索增强物理推理方面需要进一步研究的挑战。

Conclusion: RAG在提升基础模型物理推理能力方面具有潜力，但需要更多研究来解决现有挑战，特别是在多模态物理问题解决方面。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出Fusion-of-N方法，通过融合多个LLM生成样本的最优元素来创建最终答案，相比传统的Best-of-N选择方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Best-of-N方法只选择单一最佳样本，丢弃了其他样本中的有用信息，存在零和问题。

Method: 使用通用LLM评判器来综合每个样本中最具信息量的元素，合成单一最终答案。

Result: 在11种语言、3个不同任务和不同模型规模上，FusioN始终优于BoN，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 应该从单一质量评估转向接受LLM生成的多面性，通过融合多样优势来解锁潜在能力。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Motivation: 分析LLMs在处理非标准英语方言时的性能差异，探究语法规则对模型表现的影响。

Method: 将标准美式英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多项选择题回答任务中测试模型性能，并分析具体语法规则的影响。

Result: 非标准英语问题导致准确率下降高达20%，其中三个语法规则（存在性"it"、零系词、"y'all"）解释了大部分性能下降。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究关注针对个别高影响力语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，缺乏结构多样性，限制了个性化表达。扩散模型为超越自回归范式提供了新的机会。

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法指导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以实现结构与内容的更好对齐。通过共享表示机制实现细粒度个性化。

Result: 在多个任务上的实验表明该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优越性。定性分析突显了其可解释性和学习个性化模式的灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过整合语法信息，所提出的模型能更好地捕捉风格化句子构建的词汇和结构特征，支持忠实的风格生成和可泛化的零样本推理。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: 本综述为未来研究提供了路线图，旨在推动模型更加透明化的发展方向。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域和多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法提供复杂对话中所需的适应性和连贯性。

Method: 使用BERT进行槽填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行DST，在线代理进行实时答案生成的混合模型。

Result: 在波斯语多轮对话数据集上，该模型相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为构建更定制化、适应性强且更人性化的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

TL;DR: 这篇系统文献综述分析了2020-2025年间非洲低资源语言自动语音识别(ASR)的研究现状，涵盖数据集、模型、评估方法等方面，发现存在数据集不足、可复现性差、评估指标单一等问题，并提出了未来发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲拥有2000多种语言，但低资源语言在ASR研究中代表性严重不足，这阻碍了非洲大陆的数字包容性发展。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020程序，检索DBLP、ACM Digital Library等数据库，筛选出71篇相关研究，分析74个数据集、111种语言、约11,206小时的语音数据。

Result: 发现只有不到15%的研究提供了可复现材料，数据集许可不明确；自监督和迁移学习有前景但受限于预训练数据不足；大多数研究使用WER评估，很少使用CER、DER等语言学指标。

Conclusion: ASR系统发展面临数据集可用性、标注质量、许可不确定性等挑战，但社区驱动倡议和方法论进步提供了改进路径，未来发展需要利益相关者合作、伦理数据集创建、轻量建模和积极基准测试。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Conclusion: mR3证明了通过精心设计的数据和训练策略，可以构建高质量的多语言奖励模型，为多语言评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

TL;DR: MASH是一个训练框架，通过强化学习惩罚外部搜索使用同时奖励答案准确性，使LLM能够识别知识边界并选择性求助，从而实现有效的弃权决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM无法可靠识别其参数知识边界，经常对边界外问题产生幻觉回答，而人类能够识别自身局限并寻求外部帮助或弃权。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，将外部求助（搜索工具使用）作为弃权的代理指标。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上，MASH显著优于先前的高效搜索方法；在多跳数据集上答案准确率提高7.6%，并能有效区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数知识，无需预先确定知识边界即可实现弃权决策，展示了与专门弃权方法类似的行为。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型通过级联领域特定编码器实现，这使模型继承了所有组件的漏洞，需要系统研究音频后门攻击的威胁。

Method: 对四个语音编码器和三个数据集进行音频后门攻击实验，涵盖四个不同任务，并进行组件级分析识别最脆弱环节。

Result: 攻击在四个任务上均取得高成功率（90.76%-99.41%），证明了音频后门攻击的有效性和严重性。

Conclusion: 提出了基于微调的防御方法，可缓解预训练编码器中毒的威胁，为多模态模型安全提供保护方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

Motivation: LLM越来越多地参与影响人类福祉的高风险决策，但其在分配稀缺社会资源时的原则和价值观尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入社会福祉函数基准，通过动态模拟环境让LLM作为主权分配者，在异质群体中分配任务，创建集体效率与分配公平的权衡。

Result: 评估20个先进LLM发现：对话能力与分配技能无关；多数模型偏向功利主义，牺牲公平追求效率；分配策略易受输出长度和社会影响框架干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和针对性对齐来改进AI治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现后训练对齐导致LLM多样性下降（模式崩溃）的根本原因是偏好数据中的典型性偏见，并提出一种无需训练的提示策略——言语化采样，能显著提升生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练对齐经常减少LLM的多样性，导致模式崩溃。与之前归因于算法限制的研究不同，本文识别出一个根本性的数据层面驱动因素：偏好数据中的典型性偏见。

Method: 引入言语化采样（Verbalized Sampling），这是一种简单的无需训练的提示策略，让模型对一组回答进行概率分布的言语化描述（例如“生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率”）。

Result: 综合实验表明，VS在创意写作、对话模拟、开放式问答和合成数据生成方面显著提升性能，多样性提高1.6-2.1倍，且不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。能力更强的模型从VS中获益更多。

Conclusion: 本文提供了关于模式崩溃的新数据中心视角，以及一种实用的推理时补救措施，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SPHERE方法，通过保持神经元权重在超球面上的均匀分布来稳定连续模型编辑过程，防止灾难性遗忘，同时保持编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识同步，但连续编辑会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。本文旨在理解和减轻连续编辑导致的性能下降。

Method: 使用超球面能量(HE)量化编辑过程中的神经元均匀性，提出SPHERE方法：识别预训练权重矩阵的主超球面方向的稀疏互补空间，并将新知识投影到该空间，减少对主方向的扰动。

Result: 在LLaMA3(8B)和Qwen2.5(7B)上的实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时最忠实地保持了一般模型性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE提供了一种原则性的方法，通过稳定神经元权重分布来实现可靠的大规模知识编辑，在保持先验知识的同时支持可靠的连续更新。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化RAG测试问题语义覆盖度的方法，通过向量嵌入和聚类算法评估测试集对知识库的覆盖完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估缺乏系统化方法来确保测试问题充分覆盖底层知识库，导致开发者存在盲点

Method: 将文档块和测试问题嵌入统一向量空间，计算基础邻近度、内容加权覆盖度和多主题问题覆盖度等指标，并加入异常检测过滤无关问题

Result: 两个不同用例的实验证明该框架能有效量化测试覆盖度，识别覆盖不足的内容区域，并为生成新的高价值测试问题提供具体建议

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更健壮测试套件的关键工具，从而提高系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别错位文档等应用

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置往往导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 提出TransIP训练范式，通过优化嵌入空间表示来引导通用非等变Transformer模型学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Result: 在Open Molecules数据集上，TransIP在机器学习力场方面达到与最先进等变基线模型相当的性能，相比数据增强基线在不同数据集规模下性能提升40%至60%。

Conclusion: 学习等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于长距离依赖任务至关重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会导致精度下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法，将RoPE维度分组为频带，通过轻量级搜索对键和查询权重进行每频带缩放，无需微调或架构改变。

Result: Q-ROAR在长上下文任务上将模型困惑度降低超过14%，同时保持短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有系统兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR有效解决了RoPE插值与量化结合的精度问题，提供了一种实用的量化感知插值稳定化方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健康基准要么过于通用，要么面向临床医生，缺乏专门针对糖尿病患者日常管理决策的评估框架。

Method: 收集15,000名糖尿病患者一个月的连续血糖监测数据和行为日志，生成个性化问题，评估LLM在7个任务类别和5个指标上的表现。

Result: 评估8个LLM发现模型表现存在显著差异，没有单一模型在所有维度上持续优于其他模型。

Conclusion: DexBench基准旨在提升糖尿病护理AI解决方案的可靠性、安全性、有效性和实用性。

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在p-adic度量空间中进行机器学习的理论基础，证明p-adic度量能更好地捕捉层次数据的离散分支特性，并通过自然语言处理应用验证其实际意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖欧几里得度量，无法有效处理层次数据的离散分支特性，需要开发能自然尊重层次结构的度量方法。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的机器学习理论框架，证明n维平面最小化p-adic距离和时必然通过至少n+1个数据点，并将其应用于层次分类和语法形态建模。

Result: 证明了p-adic回归与欧几里得回归的关键差异：p-adic最小化必须通过实际数据点，这更符合层次数据的离散特性。在自然语言处理应用中验证了该理论的实际价值。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是正确处理机器学习中层次数据结构的基础方法，因为层次数据中插值通常不如选择实际观测点作为代表更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align是一个联邦学习框架，利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，解决表格数据的模式异质性问题，无需手动模式对齐，在隐私保护和通信效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域应用广泛，但表格数据的模式异质性和不兼容特征空间阻碍了直接聚合，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa和ClinicalBERT等预训练LLM提取语义对齐的嵌入表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，使用分区的Framingham数据集模拟模式差异，FedLLM-Align在所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络上均优于现有基线方法，F1分数提升高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境中的联邦学习提供了一个鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案，在极端模式差异下表现出优雅的性能下降，而传统方法会完全失效。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰结构优势的同时缓解了严格单峰模型的偏差问题。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

*Yujia Zheng,Shaoan Xie,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个概念学习的理论框架，通过比较多样化的观察来识别隐藏概念，无需假设特定概念类型或参数生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过比较不同观察来学习概念，这种认知机制对机器恢复数据背后的真实概念同样重要，为概念学习领域提供理论支持。

Method: 开发理论框架，利用多类观察的多样性来识别隐藏概念，不依赖特定概念类型、函数关系或参数生成模型。

Result: 当类间多样性足够时，隐藏概念可以被识别；即使条件不全局满足，也能基于局部比较提供替代保证。类与概念间的隐藏结构也能非参数识别。

Conclusion: 比较机制是概念识别的关键，理论结果在合成和真实场景中得到验证，扩展了概念学习理论的应用范围。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限反馈环境下强化学习的奖励选择问题(RLLF)，探讨了如何选择少量样本进行奖励标注来最大化策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实用问题中，由于计算或成本限制，获取大量奖励标签往往不可行。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要确定哪些样本应该被标注奖励才能最大化策略性能。

Method: 提出了RLLF问题框架，研究两种选择策略：(i)基于无奖励信息的启发式方法(如状态访问和部分价值函数)；(ii)使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 研究发现关键奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复至接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法能用比完全监督少得多的奖励标签获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的强大范式，能够显著减少所需奖励标签数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域广泛应用引发了对算法公平性的担忧。由于通常只能访问算法输出而无法了解内部机制，研究社区提出了反事实公平性度量，但从可用数据评估这些度量仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息边界，引入贝叶斯方法以高置信度约束未知的反事实公平性度量。

Result: 在COMPAS数据集上的实验显示，将种族改为非裔美国人会对COMPAS分数产生正向（虚假）效应，而从年轻到年老的转变则产生负向（直接因果）效应。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效评估反事实公平性度量，为算法公平性分析提供了实用工具，特别是在目标度量不可识别的情况下。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Motivation: 研究语言模型为何在看似简单的多位数乘法任务上失败，通过分析成功学习乘法的模型来理解其内部机制。

Method: 逆向工程分析成功学习乘法的模型，使用logit归因和线性探针研究长程依赖，发现模型通过注意力机制构建有向无环图来缓存和检索部分乘积。

Result: 成功模型使用Minkowski和和傅里叶基表示部分乘积，而标准微调模型缺乏必要的长程依赖结构。通过引入预测"运行和"的辅助损失，可以成功学习多位数乘法。

Conclusion: 揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱，并展示了正确归纳偏置如何解决这一问题。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA是一个新的参数高效微调框架，通过结构化剪枝从过参数化初始化中获得高表达性的低秩适配器，在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解任务中优于LoRA及其变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的表征能力通常落后于完全微调，关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达性强的低秩适配器。

Method: PrunedLoRA在微调过程中动态剪枝不重要组件并防止其重新激活，通过基于梯度的剪枝策略提供细粒度剪枝和恢复更新，最小化整体损失的剪枝误差。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解任务中，PrunedLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体，并在不同稀疏度水平上优于现有结构化剪枝方法。

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过结构化剪枝实现了灵活的自适应秩分配，提供了首个结构化剪枝鲁棒性的理论分析，证明基于梯度的剪枝在权重扰动下比基于激活的剪枝更鲁棒。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

TL;DR: GRPO-λ是GRPO的扩展，通过λ-return和资格迹改进LLM在复杂推理任务中的信用分配，显著提升训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法缺乏明确的奖励或评论家模型，无法对token序列进行细粒度信用分配，限制了推理能力的提升。

Method: 使用token级对数概率重新表述资格迹，并引入无评论家的时序差分误差近似，提出了几种λ-return加权变体。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的模型上，训练性能提升30-40%，在多个数学推理数据集上平均性能比GRPO提高3-4.5个百分点。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的RL微调效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

TL;DR: LoRAFusion是一个高效的LoRA微调系统，通过图分割融合内存绑定操作和自适应批处理算法，解决了现有LoRA系统的内存访问冗余和多适配器并发微调问题，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：一是对大激活张量的冗余内存访问导致运行时开销，二是无法在相同GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载均衡等性能增益机会。

Method: LoRAFusion在核级别提出图分割方法融合内存绑定操作，消除不必要的内存访问；在调度级别引入自适应批处理算法，通过分组LoRA适配器并解决装箱问题来生成平衡的、依赖感知的微批次。

Result: 与Megatron-LM相比，LoRAFusion实现了最高1.96倍（平均1.47倍）的端到端加速；与最先进的多LoRA微调系统mLoRA相比，实现了最高1.46倍（平均1.29倍）的改进。融合核实现了最高1.39倍（平均1.27倍）的核性能提升。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过核级和调度级的创新设计，显著提升了LoRA微调效率，可作为现有LoRA系统的即插即用替代方案，并已开源。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，提升计算效率和收敛速度

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际部署中的潜在问题，特别是多指令提示场景下的性能下降和指令忽略现象。

Method: 分析不同压缩方法、指令顺序和KV淘汰偏差对提示泄漏的影响，提出改进的KV缓存淘汰策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩后性能急剧下降，系统提示泄漏问题突出，不同因素对泄漏有显著影响。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩需要谨慎部署，改进淘汰策略可以减轻多指令任务中的负面影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Conclusion: DIANO展示了在潜在空间中求解PDE的能力，该潜在空间既支持维度和几何降维，又允许潜在可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算平均梯度，忽略了每个样本的梯度统计信息。作者认为计算这些统计信息在自动微分框架中并非资源密集型任务。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术和JAX的向量化转换来高效计算每个样本的梯度统计信息，几乎不增加计算和内存开销。

Result: 研究发现：1) signSGD中sign操作的位置对性能至关重要；2) Adam预处理器中均值比方差更重要，与传统认知相反。

Conclusion: 每个样本的梯度信息为算法设计提供了新的分析和可能性，可以改进优化算法的性能。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于奖励的策略来自动优化变分自编码器（VAE）工作流程，使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，通过高斯混合模型和贝叶斯高斯混合模型构建奖励函数来评估潜在空间表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释和简约的形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE虽然能构建低维表示，但其性能严重依赖多个非短视的设计选择，通常需要通过试错和经验分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究基于奖励的策略来评估潜在空间表示。通过高斯混合模型（GMM）和贝叶斯高斯混合模型（BGMM）近似潜在空间，构建奖励函数来估计模型效率。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间为构建奖励函数提供了坚实基础，能够有效估计模型效率并指导寻找最优简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于GMM和BGMM的奖励函数策略能够实现VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化，为发现简约且可解释的物理结构表示提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受编码计算范式的启发，该范式原本用于分布式计算中缓解慢节点和对抗性故障，现将其适配到机器学习中，设计一种高效的正则化机制来鼓励更平滑的表征和更可泛化的解决方案。

Method: 设计编码平滑模块，可集成到监督和无监督训练流程中，通过处理数据的线性组合来正则化学习，并在推理流程中随机化模型以增强对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 在监督和无监督任务上的广泛实验表明，编码平滑能持续改善泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击中达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是一种有效的正则化方法，能显著提升模型泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性，且计算开销最小。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了序列模型在包含状态跟踪和关联回忆的复合问题中的长度泛化能力，提出了延迟注意力层训练的策略来改善混合模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现循环网络擅长状态跟踪但不擅长关联回忆，而Transformer擅长关联回忆但状态跟踪能力无法扩展到长序列。受这两种架构互补优势的启发，研究者希望构建混合模型来同时保留这两种能力。

Method: 构建了集成循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出了一种简单的训练策略——延迟注意力层的训练，以缓解Transformer组件依赖捷径解决方案的问题。

Result: 实验表明，延迟注意力层训练的策略显著改善了混合模型的长度泛化性能，使模型在比训练序列长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖是混合模型长度泛化的主要障碍，而延迟注意力层训练是缓解这一问题的有效策略，能够显著提升混合模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

TL;DR: 提出EVaLP方法，使用能量模型作为VAE的先验，通过变分方法解决归一化常数问题，避免昂贵的MCMC采样，提高生成质量和效率。


<details>

Motivation: 解决VAE生成模糊样本的"先验空洞"问题，即先验高概率区域在后验中概率低，导致生成质量差。需要灵活匹配后验的先验，同时保持快速采样能力。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型，使用变分方法处理归一化常数，通过采样器网络近似变分形式，采用交替优化训练先验，生成时采样器简化为隐式变分先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线比较，EVaLP在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 能量基变分潜在先验方法能有效解决VAE的先验空洞问题，在保持采样效率的同时提高生成质量。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: SLogic是一个新颖的知识图谱补全框架，通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态评分，利用头实体为中心的局部子图上下文来评估规则重要性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前逻辑规则方法将规则视为通用规则，为每个规则分配固定的置信度分数，忽略了查询特定的上下文。然而，规则的重要性会因查询而异，这是一个重要限制。

Method: 引入SLogic框架，其核心是一个评分函数，利用查询头实体为中心的子图信息，动态评估每个规则的重要性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic始终优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态评分，有效解决了传统方法忽略查询上下文的问题，在知识图谱补全任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

TL;DR: Freedave是一种针对扩散大语言模型的无损并行解码算法，通过并行候选生成和验证管道，在不引入额外模型前向调用的情况下，将推理吞吐量提升至2.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有双向注意力机制的优势，但在推理效率上不如自回归模型，因为它们与KV缓存不兼容。现有的并行解码算法虽然能加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: 提出Freedave算法，采用并行解码的候选生成和验证管道，保证生成与静态采样相同的序列，无需额外模型前向调用。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，Freedave将DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍，且没有性能下降。

Conclusion: Freedave成功解决了DLLMs推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Result: 研究发现，促进静态泛化的特性（如低秩表示和简单性偏置）在持续学习场景中直接导致塑性丧失。通过数值模拟验证了理论分析，并探索了架构选择或目标扰动作为缓解策略。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了深度学习在非平稳环境中学习能力退化的根本机制，为理解塑性丧失提供了理论基础，并指出了缓解策略的研究方向。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Motivation: 传统的Lipschitz bandit问题假设奖励能够立即观察到，但在实际应用中，反馈往往存在随机延迟。本文旨在解决这种延迟反馈带来的挑战。

Method: 对于有界延迟，提出了延迟感知的缩放算法；对于无界延迟，设计了基于阶段学习策略的新方法，在精心安排的间隔内积累可靠反馈。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在各种延迟场景下都表现出高效性，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Motivation: 当前LLM依赖思维链(CoT)进行推理判断，这种依赖形成了强大但脆弱的信任基础。攻击者可能诱导LLM生成看似合理但实际错误的推理过程，这种隐蔽风险尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 利用LLM自身的幻觉，通过对模型自然生成的错误推理进行微调，然后使用Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO)结合翻转奖励和合理性正则化器来强化攻击效果，同时保持推理过程的流畅性和合理性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景下性能下降最小。人工评估显示人类评分者难以区分被操纵的推理过程和良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄悄破坏LLM的答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，强调了未来研究解决这一警示性风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

*Huitao Yang,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)框架，通过上下文好奇心正则化来增强决策预训练Transformer的分布外泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策预训练Transformer在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要解决这一局限性

Method: 引入上下文好奇心正则化，在离线预训练中使用辅助奖励预测器，以预测误差作为内在好奇心信号来鼓励更广泛的探索

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机概念验证实验中，PPT显示出更好的鲁棒性，特别是在预训练数据多样性有限且测试环境奖励方差较高时，能缓解DPT的性能下降

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然至关重要，但好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了约束马尔可夫决策过程（CMDPs）的最优值如何随初始分布变化，通过对偶分析和线性规划扰动分析推导了变化界限，并展示了如何用这些界限分析因初始分布未知变化导致的策略遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CMDPs在不同初始状态分布下不存在普遍最优策略，每当初始分布改变时都需要重新求解CMDP，这增加了复杂性。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划中的扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 得出了CMDPs最优值随初始分布变化的界限，并展示了如何将这些界限用于分析策略因初始分布未知变化而产生的遗憾。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理CMDPs中初始分布变化问题提供了理论工具，能够量化策略性能对初始分布变化的敏感性。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

TL;DR: Kanzi是一个基于流的蛋白质结构分词器，使用扩散自编码器和流匹配损失来简化蛋白质结构表示，在更小的模型规模和训练成本下实现更好的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质结构分词方法依赖定制组件，难以优化和扩展，需要开发更简单高效的tokenization方法。

Method: 使用扩散自编码器结合流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)不变注意力操作。

Result: 在重建指标上优于现有分词器，模型规模更小且训练成本更低；自回归模型在token生成上优于类似方法，但尚未达到最先进连续扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化了蛋白质结构分词器的多个方面，提供了更稳定高效的训练方法，为多模态蛋白质模型的发展提供了新工具。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

TL;DR: AReUReDi是一种离散优化算法，通过结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在序列设计中实现多目标帕累托最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行且仅支持单目标指导，而离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优性保证，需要开发能同时优化多个冲突目标的离散算法。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，偏向采样帕累托最优状态同时保持分布不变性。

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中，AReUReDi能同时优化多达五个治疗属性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），优于进化和扩散基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi为多属性生物分子生成提供了一个强大的序列基础框架。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统Transformer架构在持续学习场景中容易出现塑性损失和灾难性遗忘问题

Method: 提出仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值，但保留Transformer核心归纳偏置；建立与元学习的概念联系；进行Hessian谱分析

Result: 简化注意力机制在持续学习场景中显著改善塑性保持和遗忘问题，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中捕获元学习益处可能不是必需的，基于查询的模型有助于保持塑性

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Method: 将LLM生成程序的数值参数提取出来进行数值优化，LLM迭代程序功能结构，同时使用单独的优化循环寻找候选程序的局部最优参数集

Result: 在一系列控制任务中，该方法相比纯LLM引导搜索获得了更高的回报和更好的样本效率

Conclusion: 结合符号程序合成与数值优化能够产生可解释且高性能的策略，弥合了语言模型引导设计与经典控制调优之间的差距

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Method: GDLNN结合了图领域特定语言GDL和神经网络，通过GDL层生成表达性强且可解释的图表示。

Result: 在大多数图分类基准数据集上达到高准确率，优于主流图学习方法如GNN，并能通过现有解释技术提供高质量预测解释。

Conclusion: GDLNN是一种高效且可解释的图分类方法，在保持高性能的同时提供了模型可解释性，且包含解释成本在内的总体成本较低。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 验证了一种贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，用于工作记忆重建任务，通过高斯过程概率分类器控制空间负荷和特征绑定负荷两个变量，与传统自适应阶梯方法相比具有相似性能但能揭示个体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知实验通常只控制单一因素并用标量总结性能，需要发展能够同时控制多个变量并揭示复杂交互作用的更先进实验设计方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，在沉浸式虚拟测试环境中进行5×5工作记忆重建任务，通过高斯过程概率分类器控制空间负荷(L)和特征绑定负荷(K)两个变量，基于后验不确定性指导刺激获取。

Result: 在年轻成人群体中，GP驱动的自适应模式与传统自适应阶梯方法在K=3时具有相当性能(组内相关系数0.755)，自适应模式能揭示空间负荷与特征绑定之间的个体差异交互作用，且仅需约30个样本即可准确拟合完整模型。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法能够有效控制多个实验变量，快速收敛模型估计，并揭示传统方法无法检测的个体差异和变量间交互作用。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失持续降低，下游任务准确率提升1.1-3.1%（平均），最高达8.3%，同时提高训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现优于现有Transformer架构的混合模型设计，证明了自动架构搜索在模型设计中的价值。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了一种高效稳定的解决方案，显著提升了建模能力。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 需要从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时获得哈密顿量的不确定性估计。

Method: 在哈密顿量表面H上放置高斯过程先验，并将可变步长多步积分器约束编码为有限线性泛函，从而无需潜在状态即可对向量场和哈密顿量表面进行闭式条件化。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够设计上强制执行能量平衡和被动性，同时提供分离估计和可变步长离散化项的有限样本向量场边界。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过反转训练集和验证集的作用来识别对目标任务最有用的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在微调阶段，从目标分布中获取的样本通常很少。现有方法将目标样本作为验证集，通过逐个添加或移除训练样本来评估效果，这种方法效率较低。

Method: 反转训练和验证的角色：在验证集上微调前后，对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。核心观点是：受小验证集微调影响最大的训练样本，往往对减少目标分布的测试损失最有益。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务上的实验表明，在大多数情况下，该方法比现有最先进方法实现了更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个更简单、更快速的数据选择替代方案，并通过理论分析支持了其有效性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse

under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate
estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE
adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random

These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVMs cross-task inference

TL;DR: 提出Graph2Region（G2R）方法，通过将节点表示为封闭区域来近似计算图相似度，同时支持最大公共子图和图编辑距离的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在图相似度计算中要么需要昂贵的节点对比较，要么无法有效利用图的结构和规模信息。

Method: G2R将节点表示为封闭区域，在嵌入空间中恢复图的邻接模式，通过区域重叠近似MCS，通过不相交部分代理GED。

Result: 在MCS相似度学习中相对准确率提升60.0%，同时保持训练和推理效率，能够同时预测MCS和GED相似度。

Conclusion: G2R提供了一种有效的几何嵌入方法，能够全面评估图相似度，在准确性和效率方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，发现Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值的影响，相比线性Transformer具有更强的抗异常值能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现相当，具有上下文学习能力。但由于其门控机制引入的非线性，理论理解有限，需要对其训练动态和泛化能力进行理论分析。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型（由线性注意力组件和非线性门控层组成）的训练动态，研究其在包含加性异常值的提示下对未见二元分类任务的上下文学习泛化能力，并与线性Transformer在相同设置下进行比较。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，使用非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然Mamba可能需要更多训练迭代才能收敛，但当异常值比例超过线性Transformer可容忍阈值时，Mamba仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba模型在上下文学习中具有更强的抗异常值能力，理论分析为理解其工作机制提供了基础，并通过实证实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

*Zhouyang Liu,Ning Liu,Yixin Chen,Jiezhong He,Menghan Jia,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，用于神经子图匹配，通过保持节点根子树中特征的相对位置来解决现有方法的尺度差异问题，并引入相似性主导比增强度量来提高匹配对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在两个主要问题：1）在编码过程中忽略了节点根子树内特征的相对位置，导致尺度差异和错误的包含约束；2）铰链距离度量对匹配图对的区分能力不足，影响排序应用。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树内相邻梯队之间的层次依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征计数中保持一致的层次结构并符合包含约束。同时引入相似性主导比增强度量来量化图对之间相似性相对于不相似性的主导程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果表明，NC-Iso在保持时间效率的同时，验证了其有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，为子图检索提供了更具区分度的神经子图匹配解决方案。

Conclusion: NC-Iso通过保持特征相对位置和增强相似性度量，成功解决了现有GNN子图匹配方法的局限性，提供了更准确和可区分的子图匹配解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

### [113] [AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)
*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出了AbsTopK SAE来改进双向概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏理论基础，且其正则化器强制非负性，阻碍了单个特征表示双向概念的能力。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，推导出常见SAE变体，并提出基于ℓ0稀疏约束的AbsTopK SAE，对最大幅度激活应用硬阈值。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重构保真度、增强了解释性，并使单个特征能够编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过有监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留正负激活，发现了更丰富的双向概念表示，解决了现有SAE的结构性限制。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

*Kairun Zhang,Haoyu Li,Yanjun Zhao,Yifan Sun,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ZO Fine-tuner，一种基于学习的零阶优化器，通过紧凑且内存高效的设计自动学习有效的扰动策略，显著减少LLM微调的GPU内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶方法依赖手工设计的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中只有少量基础模型及其衍生模型被广泛采用，因此为给定LLM学习一次优化器并在不同下游任务中重用是可行且高效的。

Method: 设计了ZO Fine-tuner，支持每个LLM一次性训练，通过基于学习的方法自动学习扰动策略，具有紧凑和内存高效的特点。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于先前的零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

*Seongjae Kang,Dong Bok Lee,Juho Jung,Dongseop Kim,Won Hwa Kim,Sunghoon Joo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了上下文感知的结构化放射学报告生成（C-SRRG）方法，通过整合丰富的临床上下文信息来解决现有系统忽略临床背景的问题，显著提升了报告生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化放射学报告生成系统忽略了临床上下文信息，导致时间幻觉等关键问题。放射医生在实际诊断中会有效利用临床背景，因此需要开发能够全面整合临床上下文的方法。

Method: 提出C-SRRG方法，整合四种临床上下文：1）多视角X光图像，2）临床指征，3）成像技术，4）既往研究及对比分析。构建了相应的数据集，并使用最先进的多模态大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，整合临床上下文的C-SRRG方法显著提高了报告生成质量。发布了数据集、代码和检查点以促进未来研究。

Conclusion: 临床上下文对于自动化放射学报告生成至关重要，C-SRRG方法通过全面整合临床信息有效解决了现有系统的局限性，为临床对齐的自动化报告生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

### [116] [Plug-and-Play Prompt Refinement via Latent Feedback for Diffusion Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00430)
*Suhyeon Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的即插即用框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中进行逐步提示优化，解决了传统RL微调在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于强化学习的扩散模型微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面存在不足，而现有的提示优化方法大多采用前馈方式，未能充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练一个多模态大语言模型，使用强化学习根据扩散模型的中间潜在状态迭代更新提示，而不是直接修改扩散模型的权重。

Result: 在多种奖励函数和扩散模型骨干上的实验表明，PromptLoop能有效优化奖励、无缝泛化到未见模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合，并减轻过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示优化，实现了与Diffusion RL方法的结构类比，同时保持了基于提示对齐的灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知的动态数据增强方法，通过根据样本对模型优化的影响动态调整增强强度，解决了传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中与模型需求不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据增强方法使用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随着模型泛化能力的变化而演变。如果不考虑这种动态性，增强数据可能与模型不断变化的训练需求不匹配，从而降低训练效果。

Method: 通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向上，并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差来估计每个样本的影响。低方差样本（稳定影响）进行更强增强以强调多样性，不稳定样本则进行较温和变换以保持语义保真度和学习稳定性。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来了一致的改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、无需辅助模型或策略调优的方法，可以作为即插即用模块无缝集成到现有训练流程中，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Motivation: 神经网络训练中存储层激活的内存需求带来了显著的可扩展性挑战，需要开发内存高效的梯度计算方法。

Method: 采用控制理论中的矩阵草图技术，使用三个互补的草图矩阵通过指数移动平均维护，并自适应调整秩以平衡内存效率和近似质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上展示了可控的精度-内存权衡，并在MNIST上实现了实时梯度范数跟踪，内存开销最小。

Conclusion: 草图激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

TL;DR: 提出Eyes-on-Me攻击方法，将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，实现低成本、可扩展的RAG系统数据投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为注意力吸引器和焦点区域，通过优化吸引器引导注意力到焦点区域，在其中插入检索器语义诱饵或生成器恶意指令。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%（+35.9个百分点，比先前工作高2.6倍），单个优化的吸引器可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，表明模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb是一个轻量级的静态-动态分解框架，用于解决时间序列预测中的时间非平稳性问题。它通过将时间序列分解为时间不变和时间变化两个互补组件来提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分布随时间变化的时间非平稳性现象给可靠的时间序列预测带来根本性挑战。现有方法往往将时间变化和时间不变组件混在一起学习，导致面对分布偏移时性能不佳。

Method: TimeEmb创新性地将时间序列分解为两个组件：(1)时间不变组件，通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；(2)时间变化组件，通过受信号处理中全频谱分析启发的频域滤波机制处理。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeEmb优于最先进的基线方法，且需要更少的计算资源。全面的定量和定性分析验证了静态-动态解纠缠的有效性。

Conclusion: 这个轻量级框架可以通过简单集成改进现有的时间序列预测方法，为解决时间非平稳性问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么需要存储样本进行回放（可能引发数据安全和隐私问题），要么需要识别任务边界（在单次数据处理中难以实现），因此需要研究无需存储样本且无需任务边界的方法。

Method: 将提示学习与NCM分类器相结合，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份信息的情况下处理灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，所提方法具有有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在线持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储样本且无需任务边界信息。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型中的相变检测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [125] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标，用于分析持续学习中由捷径特征引起的认知固化问题，发现CL方法在包含捷径特征的场景中表现出负适应延迟和正性能赤字。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征（输入与标签间的偶然相关性），这会削弱模型的鲁棒性和分布外泛化能力。在持续学习中，捷径特征的利用会导致认知固化效应，阻碍新技能的学习。

Method: 引入ERI指标，包含三个可解释维度：适应延迟(AD)、性能赤字(PD)和相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上评估了多种CL方法，并在第二阶段故意引入虚假的洋红色补丁作为捷径特征。

Result: CL方法比从头训练基准更早达到准确率阈值（负AD），但在包含捷径特征的类别上最终准确率略低（正PD）。掩蔽补丁后CL方法准确率提升而基准方法下降，表明补丁对CL模型是干扰而非帮助。

Conclusion: 捷径特征在持续学习中主要起干扰作用而非帮助作用，CL方法容易受到这种认知固化的影响，ERI指标能有效诊断此类问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对最先进的电路发现方法EAP-IG进行了系统性稳定性分析，发现该方法存在高结构方差和对超参数的敏感性，质疑其发现结果的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可信赖的人工智能需要超越黑盒性能指标，理解模型的内部计算。机制可解释性(MI)旨在识别模型行为背后的算法机制，但其科学严谨性依赖于发现的可靠性。

Method: 将可解释性方法视为统计估计器，通过输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中的注入噪声等受控扰动，对EAP-IG方法进行方差和鲁棒性评估。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和对超参数的敏感性，其发现结果的稳定性受到质疑。

Conclusion: 建议该领域采用最佳实践，常规报告稳定性指标，以促进更严谨和统计基础的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

*Jing Wang,Wonho Bae,Jiahong Chen,Wenxu Wang,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的判别性迁移框架，用于源自由域自适应任务，通过扩散网络在潜在空间中生成源域线索来实现知识迁移，无需访问原始源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决源自由域自适应中无法访问源数据但需要迁移决策边界的关键挑战。

Method: 在源域训练阶段，将每个源特征的标签信息编码到其潜在邻域中，通过高斯先验拟合k近邻并训练扩散网络将噪声样本漂移回标签一致的表示。在适应阶段，从目标特征的潜在邻域采样，应用冻结的扩散模块生成源域线索，使用InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD优于最先进的方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提高源分类器在域内数据上的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、保护隐私的显式知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域自适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文深入分析了基于分类器的质量过滤方法(CQF)，发现虽然CQF能提升下游任务性能，但并不一定能改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，因为CQF也会隐式过滤高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在包含混合质量文档的网络爬取数据集上进行预训练，数据过滤变得至关重要。CQF方法被广泛使用，但其实际效果和机制需要深入分析。

Method: 通过分析CQF方法的工作原理，比较CQF过滤后的模型与在通过随机标记排列获得的不同质量合成数据上训练的模型的行为差异。

Result: CQF虽然能提升下游任务性能，但不会增强高质量数据集上的语言建模能力。与合成数据训练模型相比，CQF表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了CQF能够捕捉有意义数据质量概念的观点，表明CQF的效果可能并非源于其对数据质量的准确评估。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于黑盒时间序列域自适应（BBTSDA）的跨提示基础模型（CPFM），通过双分支网络结构和提示重建学习来解决时间序列数据的时空特性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒域自适应方法主要针对视觉应用，无法直接应用于具有独特时空特性的时间序列数据，且尚未探索基础模型在黑盒时间序列域自适应中的潜力。

Method: 构建基于时间序列基础模型的双分支网络，每个分支配备独特提示来捕捉数据分布的不同特征，在域自适应阶段开发提示和输入级别的重建学习。

Result: 在三个不同应用领域的时间序列数据集上，CPFM相比竞争对手取得了显著改进的结果。

Conclusion: CPFM方法有效解决了黑盒时间序列域自适应问题，通过利用基础模型和跨提示机制克服了时空动态特性。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了GRPO需要大组数才能稳定训练的传统观点，通过将其重新解释为对比学习，发现与DPO的基本联系，证明仅需2个rollout的2-GRPO就能达到与16-GRPO相当的性能，同时大幅减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为GRPO需要大组数来确保统计估计的稳定性，但这带来了巨大的计算开销。本文旨在挑战这一假设，探索最小化rollout数量的可行性。

Method: 将GRPO重新框架为对比学习形式，揭示其与DPO的基本联系，并研究仅使用2个rollout的2-GRPO配置。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但只使用了1/8的rollouts，训练时间减少了70%以上。

Conclusion: GRPO并不需要大组数来保证训练稳定性，2-GRPO是可行的且高效的替代方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

TL;DR: 研究比较了LLM推理的两种架构：双模型潜在推理与统一软嵌入基线，发现在相同计算预算下，统一方法表现接近最优双模型设计，表明当前双模型设计主要增加计算而非实质性提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单一模型架构，研究双架构潜在推理的有效性，特别是通过增加通道容量和联合微调来改进潜在通信。

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上测试两种假设：增加通道容量(H1)和通过联合微调学习通信(H2)，并与统一软嵌入基线进行比较，使用相同的潜在令牌预算。

Result: H2表现最强，H1收益有限；统一基线几乎匹配H2并超越H1；增加潜在令牌预算无法提升鲁棒性；潜在分析显示子空间重叠且专业化有限。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在理论上仍有前景，但可能需要明确塑造潜在空间用于算法规划的目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法虽然能最大化奖励，但往往存在奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题

Method: 采用变分期望最大化框架：E步通过测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本；M步使用E步发现的样本来精炼扩散模型

Result: DAV能够在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中优化奖励同时保持多样性

Conclusion: DAV框架通过迭代的E步和M步过程，有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的训练范式正在从静态数据集转向基于经验的学习，需要复杂环境交互来获取技能。

Method: 开发GEM框架，包含多样化环境套件、集成工具和示例脚本，支持五种流行的RL训练框架。使用ReBN进行基线测试，并与PPO、GRPO和REINFORCE进行对比。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

TL;DR: Differential Attention (DA) 通过减法结构抑制冗余上下文减少幻觉，但理论分析和实验表明其结构脆弱性，在对抗扰动下梯度范数增加、局部Lipschitz常数升高，导致更高的攻击成功率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DA注意力机制在提升任务相关焦点同时的结构脆弱性问题，揭示其在对抗攻击下的敏感性放大现象。

Method: 理论分析负梯度对齐机制，系统实验验证ViT/DiffViT和预训练CLIP/DiffCLIP在五个数据集上的表现，进行深度依赖实验。

Result: DA相比标准注意力有更高攻击成功率、频繁梯度对立和更强局部敏感性；深度堆叠在小扰动下提供噪声抵消保护，但在大攻击预算下保护减弱。

Conclusion: DA在干净输入上提升判别焦点但增加对抗脆弱性，需要在未来注意力机制设计中同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级诊断套件来量化大型语言模型中前馈网络(FFN)的频谱利用率，发现软秩随FFN宽度呈完美幂律增长，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长，表明FFN加宽主要增加低能量尾方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用其潜在空间。作者希望研究FFN的频谱利用率，以了解模型容量如何被有效利用。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件——硬秩(参与比)、软秩(香农秩)、频谱集中度和复合频谱利用率指数(SUI)，在LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型上量化有意义的潜在方向激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称频谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度呈几乎完美的幂律增长，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长且方差高。这表明FFN加宽主要增加低能量尾方向，主导模式子空间早期饱和。

Conclusion: 将FFN宽度选择重新定义为尾容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为推理高效的大型语言模型设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLM通过强化学习对批处理和提示选择策略仍然敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法。

Method: PCL使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息性提示来优化训练。

Result: PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现了12.1倍和16.9倍的提示识别速度提升，避免了昂贵的rollout，达到最高性能或显著减少达到相当性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了改进的上限性能与效率之间的权衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种机器学习模型（线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林）在预测预期寿命方面的表现，发现随机森林模型具有最高的预测准确度（R²=0.9423），并识别出免疫接种率和人口属性是关键预测因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测预期寿命对于公共卫生和经济社会发展至关重要，但由于人口、环境和医疗因素的复杂相互作用，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 使用来自世界卫生组织和联合国的真实数据集，评估线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种机器学习模型，通过R²、平均绝对误差和均方根误差评估性能，并使用p值和特征重要性指标确保模型可解释性。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（R²=0.9423），显著优于线性回归和回归决策树。免疫接种率（白喉、麻疹）和人口属性（HIV/AIDS、成人死亡率）被识别为预测预期寿命的关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: 集成方法与透明度的结合能有效应对公共卫生挑战。未来研究应探索先进的插补策略、替代算法（如神经网络）和更新的数据，以进一步提高预测准确性并支持循证决策。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

*Yiran Shen,Yu Xia,Jonathan Chang,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个多目标对齐框架，通过标准化过程奖励模型训练、多动作头DPO和向量化奖励，同时优化数学准确性、人类价值观和多轮对话等多个目标，减少目标间的权衡并提供细粒度推理时用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法通常将异构信号压缩为单一优化目标，无法同时处理可验证奖励（如数学准确性）、不可验证主观偏好（如人类价值观）和复杂交互场景（如多轮对话）等多维对齐需求。

Method: 1. 标准化过程奖励模型训练，监督模型的思维链推理；2. 使用多动作头DPO进行多目标对齐；3. 采用向量化奖励，各维度对应不同目标而非单一标量。

Result: 在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话等任务上的实验表明，该框架能同时提升多个目标的性能，最小化跨目标权衡，并实现灵活的推理时用户控制。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功解决了多目标强化学习中的目标冲突问题，为多维对齐提供了有效解决方案，同时保持了推理时的用户控制能力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 该研究发现RL训练中LLM参数更新具有秩1主导性和线性动态特性，基于此提出了AlphaRL加速框架，可在保持性能的同时实现2.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在RL训练中的参数动态特性，以开发更高效、可解释的训练方法。

Method: 通过分析8个LLM和7种算法的参数更新矩阵，发现秩1主导性和线性动态特性，并基于此设计AlphaRL加速框架。

Result: 验证了秩1特性可恢复99%性能增益，AlphaRL实现2.5倍加速且保持96%以上推理性能。

Conclusion: 该发现为大规模RL训练提供了原则性、可解释且高效的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

TL;DR: Toucan是一个包含150万条轨迹的开源工具-智能体数据集，基于近500个真实MCP环境构建，解决了现有数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区缺乏高质量、许可宽松的工具-智能体训练数据，现有数据集在多样性、真实性和多工具多轮交互方面存在局限。

Method: 利用真实MCP环境生成多样化任务，使用5个模型生成工具使用查询，经过质量过滤后由3个教师模型在2个智能体框架下生成轨迹，并通过规则和模型验证确保质量。

Result: 在Toucan上微调的模型在BFCL V3基准测试中超越了更大的闭源模型，并在MCP-Universe Bench上推进了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集填补了开源工具-智能体训练数据的空白，为开发更强大的LLM智能体系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究未能充分解释SSMs高性能背后的机制，缺乏对其学习动态的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列在状态中的存储方式评估SSMs的记忆容量，建立S4模型的理论等价性，并通过实验验证初始参数的重要性。

Result: 实验证实扩展记忆很困难，固定循环权重比自适应权重能获得相当或更好的性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出BroRL方法，通过增加每个训练样本的rollout数量（扩展到数百次）来扩大探索范围，解决了ProRL方法在数千步训练后性能饱和的问题，实现了持续的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如ProRL通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但性能在数千步后达到饱和。本文旨在探索通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来补充扩展强化学习的新范式。

Method: 基于质量平衡方程分析，提出BroRL方法，大幅增加每个训练样本的rollout数量至数百次，确保充分探索。理论分析表明随着rollout数量增加，未采样项的影响会减弱，保证正确token概率质量的扩展。

Result: BroRL方法成功复活了在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，实现了稳健的持续改进。在1.5B模型上，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习性能的有效补充策略，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能饱和限制，为复杂推理能力的开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换解决ANNS验证瓶颈，将90%以上信号能量压缩到前半维度，实现早期候选剪枝和部分距离计算，在多种ANNS方法中获得2-30倍端到端加速且无召回损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ANNS算法在推荐系统、图像检索、NLP和RAG中广泛应用，但现有系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间计算距离，存在验证瓶颈。

Method: 提出PANORAMA方法，使用数据自适应学习的正交变换实现距离边界的累积精炼，结合层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式，无需修改索引即可集成到IVFPQ/Flat、HNSW、MRPT和Annoy等ANNS方法中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GIST、OpenAI Ada 2和Large 3等多样化数据集上的实验表明，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且没有召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换有效解决了ANNS验证瓶颈，显著提升了查询效率，为大规模向量检索系统提供了实用的加速方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作Golowich和Livni[2021]在可实现设置下对遗忘型对手实现了O_d(log T)错误边界，但对自适应对手只能达到Õ_d(√T)边界，存在性能差距。本文旨在缩小这一差距并扩展至更一般的不可知设置。

Method: 提出新的私有在线学习算法，针对具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类，在可实现设置下优化对自适应对手的性能，并在不可知设置下设计算法处理更一般的数据分布。

Result: 在可实现设置下，新算法对自适应对手实现了O_d(log T)错误边界，优于先前工作的Õ_d(√T)；在不可知设置下，实现了Õ_d(√T)的次线性遗憾，证明有限Littlestone维度概念类在该设置下也可私有在线学习。

Conclusion: 本文成功缩小了私有在线学习中可实现设置下对自适应对手的性能差距，并首次在不可知设置下为有限Littlestone维度概念类建立了私有在线可学习性，扩展了私有在线学习的理论边界。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型在降水临近预报中可能产生校准不良的概率预测，而标准校准指标如ECE无法充分捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准误差。

Method: 引入了期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)指标，并将计算机视觉中的后处理技术扩展到预报领域，采用选择性缩放和提前时间条件化方法。

Result: 选择性缩放结合提前时间条件化能够在不降低预报质量的情况下减少模型校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE指标能更好地捕捉有序类别（如降水量）的校准误差，所提出的后处理方法有效改善了降水临近预报的概率预测校准度。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出结构因果最优传输方法，通过整合结构方程和因果图信息来增强分布鲁棒优化中的模糊集设计，解决样本外泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布鲁棒优化方法仅利用因果图信息设计模糊集，未能充分利用结构方程信息，导致模糊集可能不够现实。本文旨在通过整合完整的结构因果模型信息来构建更准确的模糊集。

Method: 提出结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，引入正则化版本用正则项替代复杂因果约束，通过凸差规划实现高效算法。在结构信息缺失时仍能有效估计并提供有限样本保证。

Result: 该方法能克服最优传输问题的维度灾难，实现维度无关的快速收缩。与先前方法相比，能生成更现实的概率分布，在平衡保守性和准确性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结构因果最优传输通过整合结构方程信息显著提升了模糊集的现实性，其松弛版本提供了高效求解算法，在结构信息估计和维度缩放方面都具有优势。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

Motivation: 现实应用如推荐系统中，多个学习智能体需要在探索与利用之间平衡，同时保持安全保证以避免灾难性故障。需要研究多智能体网络环境下的安全协作学习问题。

Method: MA-SCLUCB算法，采用周期性交替执行动作选择和共识构建阶段。智能体仅与直接邻居通信，网络优化全局参数（局部参数的平均值）。

Result: 算法以高概率实现遗憾界$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$，其中d是维度，T是时间范围，$|\lambda_2|$是网络第二大特征值模。

Conclusion: 分布式学习在合理连接的网络中，即使有安全保证也能实现接近最优的性能，协作带来$\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$的改进，通信开销仅对数增长，阶段安全性仅增加低阶遗憾。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

Motivation: 函数数据的无限维特性使得表示学习具有挑战性，传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核函数限制了数据驱动的灵活性，而深度学习方法将函数视为固定网格向量忽略了内在连续性。

Method: 结合双向神经控制微分方程和专家混合驱动的向量场形成连续注意力，捕捉函数内部连续性；通过多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系变化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性，对函数的任意采样离散观测具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME提供了一个完全数据驱动的函数对函数回归框架，能够有效处理函数数据的连续性和依赖关系，在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

Motivation: 现有Muon、Scion、Gluon等优化器虽然通过层式线性最小化预言器(LMO)在非欧几里得范数球上优化深度学习，但缺乏分布式框架且存在通信瓶颈。现有分布式变体都是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of

ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分析隧道开挖对桩基影响时存在计算复杂、效率低的问题，需要结合物理知识和实测数据的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种机器学习算法在数字发展干预文档分类任务中的性能，采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型来优化多分类效果，发现数据量不是唯一影响因素，类内相似性和类间差异性也很关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数字干预领域的快速发展，需要改进数字发展组织的工作报告方式。虽然自动文档分类在NLP中很流行，但针对特定任务的模型在其他数据集上可能表现不佳，因此需要训练和评估多个模型来优化结果。

Method: 使用公开的数字发展干预文档数据库，比较决策树、k近邻、支持向量机、AdaBoost、随机梯度下降、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归等ML算法。采用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数评估性能，使用过采样处理类别不平衡问题，并采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型。

Result: 研究发现数据量不是影响性能的唯一因素，类内相似性和类间差异性对分类性能也有重要影响。通过One vs Rest方法构建的组合模型能够优化多分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为数字发展干预文档分类提供了有效的机器学习方法，强调了在构建分类模型时需要考虑类内相似性和类间差异性，而不仅仅是数据量的大小。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合随机过程理论和深度学习，为复杂系统中的生存现象提供基于物理原理的可解释参数化建模方法，不假设比例风险。

Method: 使用深度神经网络将输入变量映射到初始条件、漂移和扩散等物理意义参数，在选择的FHT过程（如带漂移或不带漂移的布朗运动）中表示事件时间为潜在扩散过程首次通过吸收边界的时间。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上与Cox回归和其他参数生存模型比较，DeepFHT达到了与最先进方法相当的预测准确性，同时保持了基于物理的可解释参数化。

Conclusion: 随机过程理论与深度学习的结合为建模复杂系统中的生存现象提供了一条原则性途径，能够阐明输入特征与风险之间的关系。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过TD学习实现了从离线数据中学习跨策略的长期潜在动态表示，为无监督强化学习提供了一种有效的方法，并在零样本强化学习中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域限制，在未见数据上微调后的性能提升有限，相比专门模型没有明显优势

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性使得基础模型方法效果有限，专门的小模型在实际应用中更具优势

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Conclusion: LEAP编码作为图表示学习流程的强大组件具有显著潜力，能够解决传统MPNNs的局限性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Result: 实验表明，使用低阶优化器能显著提高遗忘鲁棒性，混合优化器在保持遗忘效果的同时增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 优化器的选择对LLM遗忘鲁棒性至关重要，低阶优化器通过收敛到更难扰动的损失函数盆地来增强鲁棒性，混合优化器提供了有效的平衡方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发布新消息，LLM难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的机制来指导LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 引入原位反馈交互范式，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于这个修改后的响应生成修订版本，而不是依赖新的消息反馈。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原位反馈比传统多轮反馈表现更好，同时使用token减少79.1%。控制环境分析显示原位反馈解决了多轮反馈的核心限制。

Conclusion: 原位反馈为推理密集型任务中的LLM指导提供了更自然和有效的机制，能够更精确地应用反馈到错误部分，避免引入新错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Method: 提出了设计选择和实现方案，允许用户以系统无关的方式表达约束条件，在用户感兴趣区域内高效最大化模式多样性，同时保持样本效率。

Result: 实现了交互式系统探索，能够在满足用户约束的前提下发现多样化的模式，同时保持全局多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了复杂系统探索中的关键挑战，通过约束表达用户期望，实现了约束多样性与全局多样性的有效平衡。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂老虎机理论之间的关键联系，为在线意见动态管理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动指导，该方法增强了利用能力而不牺牲多样性，为GFlowNets在大型稀疏奖励空间中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot

extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

Motivation: 传统的分类器自由引导(CFG)使用固定的引导权重，虽然能提高感知质量，但会导致分布对齐变差。需要找到更好的权重设置方法。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ω_{c,(s,t)}，它是条件c、起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程之间的分布不匹配来实现。

Conclusion: 动态学习的引导权重比静态权重更有效，能在保持高质量生成的同时更好地对齐目标分布。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

*Luckeciano C. Melo,Alessandro Abate,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种曲率感知策略优化（CAPO）方法，通过跟踪和利用二阶几何信息来稳定强化学习中的策略梯度优化，提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在大型语言模型推理中的优化稳定性研究不足，导致需要保守的超参数选择，增加了训练样本需求和计算成本。

Method: 形式化考虑二阶几何的策略梯度随机优化问题，提出可计算框架跟踪曲率信息，设计数据选择干预机制，通过屏蔽导致不稳定更新的样本来优化训练过程。

Result: 在标准数学推理基准测试中，CAPO在激进学习机制下确保稳定更新，仅屏蔽少于8%的token即可实现比标准GRPO高达30倍的样本效率提升。

Conclusion: CAPO通过曲率感知的优化方法有效解决了策略梯度优化的稳定性问题，为可扩展的后训练提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于上下文对决赌博机的LLM路由方法，通过类别校准微调(CCFT)学习模型嵌入，并应用感觉良好的汤普森采样算法，在平衡用户满意度、模型专业知识和推理成本的同时实现高效路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM路由问题，即在选择最佳模型处理每个查询时，需要平衡用户满意度、模型专业知识和推理成本这三个关键因素。

Method: 将路由问题建模为上下文对决赌博机，提出类别校准微调(CCFT)方法通过对比学习从离线数据中学习模型嵌入，并应用感觉良好的汤普森采样算法(FGTS.CDB)进行动态路由决策。

Result: 在RouterBench和MixInstruct数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比使用通用OpenAI嵌入模型的基线方法，实现了更低的累积遗憾、更快的收敛速度，以及更好的鲁棒性和性能-成本平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的基于上下文对决赌博机的LLM路由框架能够有效平衡多个目标，在保证性能的同时优化成本，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题或数据收集限制导致的微观样本中某些属性信息缺失的挑战。

Method: 使用掩码矩阵表示缺失值，提出WGAN训练算法，让模型能够从包含缺失信息的训练数据集中学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的合成数据与使用完整数据训练的模型以及实际人口数据高度相似。

Conclusion: 该方法为不完整数据的人口合成提供了稳健解决方案，展示了深度生成模型在推进人口合成能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用条件表格生成对抗网络(CT-GAN)来生成目标人口的方法，包括单独使用CT-GAN和与FBS-CO结合的混合方法，发现单独CT-GAN在匹配单变量分布方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的确定性人口合成方法在处理高维数据、可扩展性和零单元格问题时面临挑战，特别是在为目标场景生成人口时。

Method: 使用CT-GAN直接从边际约束生成目标人口，或通过混合方法将CT-GAN与FBS-CO结合，CT-GAN生成描述性基础人口，FBS-CO根据目标年份边际进行优化。

Result: 单独CT-GAN模型表现最佳，能生成符合单变量分布的逼真群体，但在保持多变量关系方面存在困难。混合模型相比FBS-CO有所改进。

Conclusion: CT-GAN是生成目标人口的有效方法，深度学习生成模型可以与传统合成技术成功集成以提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新的架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，实现更高效的训练过程，平均减少40%训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，限制了训练效率。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识，优化训练过程。

Method: GLAI通过固定稳定的ReLU激活模式来分离结构知识，将MLP重新表述为路径组合，仅优化定量组件（权重和偏置）。

Result: 在多种实验设置中，GLAI在保持与MLP相同参数量的情况下，准确率相当或更高，训练时间平均减少约40%。

Conclusion: GLAI确立了一个新的设计原则，可作为通用模块替代MLP，为未来集成到Transformer等大规模架构中开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Conclusion: 交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差的组合在强化学习中具有优势，值得在实际应用中采用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Result: Boruta-mRMR组合相比单独使用mRMR减少了特征数量，加快了训练时间，同时保持甚至提高了分类准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在多类基因表达数据分析中在准确性、稳定性和实际应用性方面具有明显优势

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

Method: RiskPO使用混合风险价值目标，对奖励分布的多个区域进行加权关注，并设计问题捆绑方案来丰富反馈信号

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均显著优于GRPO及其变体

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了严格有效的范式

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出两种修正算法来解决RLVR系统中验证器不可靠性问题，通过建模验证器为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，分别使用反向修正和正向修正来恢复无偏策略梯度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR系统使用二进制奖励训练策略以降低验证器被攻击的风险，但这会引入假阴性（拒绝正确答案）和假阳性（接受错误答案）问题，影响训练效果。

Method: 1) 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道；2) 提出反向修正算法来消除观测二进制奖励的偏差；3) 提出正向修正算法重新加权得分函数项；4) 在GRPO-based RLVR流水线中实现这两种轻量级修正。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种修正方法均优于未修正训练；正向变体收敛更快且在更重噪声下保持稳定；通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率，性能优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的修正算法有效解决了RLVR系统中验证器不可靠性问题，特别是正向修正具有更好的收敛性和稳定性，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Conclusion: RECAP方法有效增强了模型的安全对齐能力，即使在重复尝试覆盖其推理的情况下也能保持安全性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络作为机器学习模型具有潜在的高能效优势，但脉冲机制的非可微性和稀疏性使其难以通过梯度传播算法训练。

Method: 基于SWIM算法，提出S-SWIM算法，将随机特征方法从人工神经网络适配到脉冲响应模型SNN，实现无需近似脉冲函数梯度的端到端训练。

Conclusion: S-SWIM为SNN训练提供了快速、高性能且可解释的解决方案，有效解决了SNN训练中的梯度传播难题。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在医疗筛查中最小化检测成本的同时保证分类错误率不超过预设阈值的算法，通过交替进行标签收集和分布估计来决策何时需要进行检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗筛查等场景中，诊断测试成本高昂，需要平衡检测成本与分类准确性，在保证错误率不超过预设阈值的前提下最小化检测次数。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，交替进行标签收集和分布估计来估计逻辑回归参数和上下文分布，计算保守的数据驱动阈值来决定何时需要进行测试。

Result: 算法以至少1-δ的概率不超过目标错误分类率，且相比知道真实参数和特征分布的神谕基线，只需要O(√T)的额外测试次数。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在错误约束逻辑测试中实现无遗憾保证的方法，可直接应用于成本敏感的医疗筛查，仿真验证了理论保证的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Motivation: 为几何图开发具有刚性旋转平移对称性（SE(3)等变性）的散射变换，以在保持高性能的同时大幅减少模型参数。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的几何散射变换，能够处理标量和向量节点特征，并将其整合到几何图神经网络框架中。

Conclusion: 所提出的等变散射变换为几何图神经网络提供了一种参数高效且性能优异的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for
geometric graphs containing scalar and vector node features. This new
scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body
roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a
geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant

TL;DR: 本文分析了无意义标记插入提升LLM推理性能的机制，并提出激活重分布模块(ARM)来更有效地实现类似性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究观察到在查询提示前插入长序列无意义标记能持续提升LLM推理性能，但这一现象背后的机制尚不清楚。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，这是一种轻量级推理时技术，通过识别非线性函数后的近零激活并将其向外移动，直接修改激活而不改变输入序列。

Result: 在多种基准测试和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，ARM能持续提升LLM在推理任务上的性能，且实现仅需几行简单代码。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为无意义标记的意外益处提供了清晰的机制解释，还提供了一种简单有效的技术来利用激活重分布进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法未能充分考虑提示难度变化或依赖简单过滤机制，导致计算资源浪费，需要从梯度优化角度系统提升训练效率

Method: 基于理论分析提出CurES方法，通过优化提示采样分布和rollout数量分配来加速收敛，并使用贝叶斯后验估计最小化计算开销

Result: 在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO方法提升3.30和4.82个点，且收敛速度更快

Conclusion: 从梯度优化角度系统分析训练效率影响因素，提出的CurES方法在性能和收敛速度上均优于基线方法

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了Gated X-TFC方法，通过软学习的域分解解决PINNs在边界层问题中的梯度分辨率问题，显著提高计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs和相关方法在解决奇异摄动边界值问题时难以处理尖锐梯度，而X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化，但在边界层问题上计算效率低下且不兼容域分解。

Method: 使用可微分的logistic门控机制实现软域分解，动态调整RBF核宽度，无需接口惩罚；引入算子条件元学习层，学习从PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差降低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%；成功扩展到多子域和高维问题。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单且计算高效的替代方案，特别适用于具有挑战性的边界层问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI模型可能隐藏知识的问题，开发技术来发现模型拥有但不会主动透露的秘密信息，这对于模型安全审计和透明度很重要。

Method: 训练三种LLM家族使其拥有特定知识但在直接询问时否认，然后设计黑盒（如预填充攻击）和白盒（如logit lens和稀疏自编码器）技术来诱导秘密知识。

Result: 大多数技术比简单基线有所改进，预填充攻击在2/3设置中表现最佳，而在剩余设置中白盒技术最有效。

Conclusion: 成功建立了秘密诱导的公共基准，证明了多种技术可以有效发现AI隐藏的知识，这对模型审计和透明度具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习随机动力系统模型，克服了传统自编码器方法在随机系统中的限制。

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型缺乏处理非结构化上下文信息、回答领域特定问题和生成自然语言解释的能力，而LLM在数值时间序列处理上表现不佳。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用补丁式编码器-解码器架构增强LLM的时间序列感知能力，在包含200多万个时间序列和文本交错样本的大规模语料库上进行训练，涵盖多种分析任务。

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列分析与自然语言结合的任务上表现出色，虽然不旨在超越专业模型，但提供了现有方法无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的时间序列分析范式，弥合了数值计算和自然语言理解之间的差距，通过自然语言交互使复杂的时间推理能力民主化。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

Motivation: 生物特征数据敏感，集中式训练存在隐私风险。联邦学习虽然提供隐私保护替代方案，但面临可解释性和异构数据（非IID）的挑战。

Method: 在中央服务器添加注意力机制，根据重要性加权本地模型更新；使用差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据；采用孪生卷积神经网络提取指纹特征。

Result: A3-FL框架在FVC2004指纹数据上表现优于标准联邦学习（FedAvg）和静态基线：注意力方法准确率0.8413，FedAvg为0.8164，本地仅为0.7664，集中式为0.7997；即使使用差分隐私，准确率仍保持0.8330。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个可扩展且隐私敏感的生物特征系统，适用于分布式环境中的安全有效识别。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

TL;DR: COUNTS是首个通过强化学习训练LLM在时间序列任务上执行思维链推理的框架，使用残差向量量化VAE创建离散token，通过两阶段训练显著提升LLM在时间序列分析中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列分析需要多步推理能力（如反事实分析、逻辑推理等），但现有模型无法显式执行这些推理过程。虽然LLM在数学和编程领域展现了思维链推理能力，但在时间序列任务上表现仍然不佳。

Method: 使用残差向量量化VAE创建高保真离散token集成到预训练LLM词汇表中；采用两阶段训练：首先在时间序列分析任务上进行监督微调，然后使用Group Relative Policy Optimization在可验证问题上训练，通过提示策略鼓励显式推理步骤。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂时间数据推理开辟了新可能性，证明了RL驱动的思维链推理方法在时间序列分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PDR（并行-蒸馏-精炼）的推理方法，通过并行生成多个草稿、蒸馏到有限工作空间、然后精炼的方式，在保持准确性的同时降低上下文长度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理训练鼓励LLMs生成长思维链，虽然提高了准确性，但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。作者希望探索能否通过元认知能力找到帕累托前沿上的其他组合，比如在保持或提高准确性的同时降低成本和延迟。

Method: 提出了PDR方法：1）并行生成多样化的草稿；2）将其蒸馏到有限的文本工作空间；3）基于该工作空间进行精炼，产生输出作为下一轮的种子。通过并行度控制上下文长度，使其与生成的总token数解耦。

Result: PDR方法在数学任务上表现优于长思维链方法，同时延迟更低。当并行度为1时得到SR（顺序精炼）方法，性能也优于长思维链。训练8B思维模型与PDR推理方法一致，在AIME 2024上提升11%，AIME 2025上提升9%。

Conclusion: 迭代推理管道在匹配的顺序预算下超越了单次推理基线，PDR带来了最大的性能提升。这种模型编排的成功引发了是否可以通过进一步训练来改变帕累托前沿的问题。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出将生物序列特征表示转换到双曲面空间的方法，通过计算双曲面特征的内积来构建核矩阵，从而更有效地分析序列关系并提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维欧几里得空间中难以捕捉序列数据的复杂关系和层次结构，这限制了序列分类和相似性度量的准确性。

Method: 将生物序列特征表示转换到双曲面空间，在双曲面上映射序列以保留其固有结构信息，然后基于双曲面特征计算核矩阵来捕获序列间的成对相似性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法能有效捕捉重要的序列相关性并提高分类准确性。

Conclusion: 通过将序列特征转换到双曲面空间并利用内积构建核矩阵，可以更好地分析生物序列关系并提升分类性能。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: TabINR是一个基于隐式神经表示(INR)的表格数据填补框架，通过可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，能够在不修改训练模型的情况下实现实例自适应填补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常存在缺失值，传统简单填补策略会引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，需要能够提供高质量填补、对数据集大小鲁棒且推理快速的填补方法。

Method: 采用自解码器架构的隐式神经表示框架，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，可以从部分观测中推断嵌入，实现实例自适应填补。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，显示出持续强大的填补准确性，在大多数情况下匹配或优于传统方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习模型(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架为表格数据填补提供了高质量、鲁棒且高效的解决方案，特别是在处理高维数据集时表现出明显优势。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

*Haizhong Zheng,Jiawei Zhao,Bedi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO是一种新的异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，能够在高延迟数据下实现稳定的离策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖同步训练，需要每次更新时生成新的数据，效率低下且难以扩展。异步RL系统虽然解耦了数据生成和训练，但在处理高延迟数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO（Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization）方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，精确屏蔽高方差标记并保持优化稳定性。

Result: M2PO显著减少了高延迟下的裁剪标记比例（从1.22%降至0.06%），在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试中，即使数据延迟达到256个模型更新，也能实现稳定的离策略训练，并达到同步训练的性能水平。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了延迟数据如果被适当利用，可以与同步数据一样具有信息价值，为大规模语言模型推理的高效强化学习训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的梯度去噪后处理算法，用于提高差分隐私语言模型微调的样本效率，在保持隐私保证的同时显著减少训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，添加的噪声会破坏梯度矩阵的低秩结构，增加熵值并降低优化效率

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行后处理去噪，恢复梯度矩阵的低秩结构，提高与原始信号的对齐度

Result: 在RoBERTa模型GLUE任务上的DP-SGD微调中，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，在不需要最优性能时显著减少训练时间

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，有效提升私有语言模型训练的实用性

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够生成平滑的轨迹，并在温和假设下保证插值的唯一性。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Result: 研究表明预训练分布的统计特性（如尾部行为）直接影响上下文学习的性能，控制这些关键统计特性对于构建具备上下文学习能力且可靠的大语言模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 预训练分布的关键统计特性控制是构建具备上下文学习能力和可靠性的语言模型的关键因素，这为理解和改进上下文学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Method: 将示例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法(COM-BOM)寻找准确性和校准误差之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准测试的多个任务上，COM-BOM在联合优化两个目标方面优于或匹配基线方法，且仅需最少的LLM API调用。

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确性和模型校准，为可信的上下文学习提供了更好的示例选择方案。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Conclusion: 这是首个刻画WN如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的工作，证明了WN在理论上的优势。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的采样多样性控制机制，适用于各种预训练模型，在多个任务中都能带来性能提升。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

Motivation: 现有将预训练密集模型升级为稀疏MoE的方法虽然能有效增加模型容量，但由于简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，即使使用常规正则化也难以解决路由置信度低、区分度弱的问题。

Method: 引入DPSL路由器正则化技术，通过将专家分配匹配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在升级的MoE视觉语言模型（使用Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干）上的实验表明，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准测试中持续优于其他升级策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL有效解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更具适应性、性能更高的模型，且作为通用工具可应用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

propagation, we establish conditions under which spatial and temporal
boundaries share common dynamics, derive identification results, and propose
consistent estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance of
our methods under various data-generating processes. The framework provides
tools for detecting when local treatments become systemic and identifying
critical thresholds for policy intervention.

Abstract: This paper develops a generalized (quasi-) Bayes framework for conditional
moment restriction models, where the parameter of interest is a nonparametric
structural function of endogenous variables. We establish contraction rates for
a class of Gaussian process priors and provide conditions under which a
Bernstein-von Mises theorem holds for the quasi-Bayes posterior. Consequently,
we show that optimally weighted quasi-Bayes credible sets achieve exact
asymptotic frequentist coverage, extending classical results for parametric GMM
models. As an application, we estimate firm-level production functions using
Chilean plant-level data. Simulations illustrate the favorable performance of
generalized Bayes estimators relative to common alternatives.

TL;DR: ToolBrain是一个轻量级框架，通过强化学习训练智能体使用工具，解决手动设计奖励、训练数据有限和多工具选择困难等问题，支持多种训练策略和自动化功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练智能体使用工具存在挑战：需要手动设计奖励、训练数据有限、多工具选择困难，导致适应慢、计算资源浪费和性能不佳。

Method: 提出ToolBrain框架，支持灵活强化学习（包括GRPO和DPO）和监督学习，提供自定义奖励函数或自动LLM评判系统，包含知识蒸馏、自动任务生成、工具检索、高效微调管道等功能。

Result: 通过训练CodeAct智能体执行邮件搜索任务的案例展示，工具使用技能快速提升达30.0%，同时保持代码库简洁可扩展。

Conclusion: ToolBrain为研究人员和从业者提供了易用的框架，降低LLM智能体适应特定领域的门槛，促进Agentic AI发展。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at
https://toolbrain.org.

*Evan Heus,Rick Bookstaber,Dhruv Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于供应链风险分析，通过将供应链网络视为知识图谱，利用网络中心性评分指导图谱遍历，结合上下文模板使定量数据对LLM可理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂、多模态的金融风险数据时存在困难，标准检索增强生成方法过于简化关系，而专业模型成本高且静态。

Method: 将供应链网络建模为知识图谱，使用网络中心性评分指导图谱遍历提取关键风险路径，结合数值因子表和新闻流数据，采用上下文模板将原始数据嵌入自然语言。

Result: 该轻量级方法能够在无需昂贵微调或专用图谱数据库的情况下，实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述。

Conclusion: 通过利用网络与知识图谱之间的内在对偶性，该框架有效解决了LLM在金融风险分析中的局限性，提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

TL;DR: 提出自适应推理抑制方法，动态减少冗余推理步骤，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本

Method: 提出自适应推理抑制方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值，动态抑制冗余推理步骤

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，实现了53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性

Conclusion: ARS方法在多个模型架构上都能有效提升推理效率，为大型推理语言模型的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张NeurIPS会议应积极推动AI政策领域的科学共识形成，借鉴IPCC在气候政策方面的经验，通过试点项目来填补当前AI政策共识形成机制的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI政策制定缺乏科学共识形成机制，而NeurIPS作为AI领域的领先会议，具备推动这一进程的独特优势。

Method: 建议NeurIPS借鉴IPCC的经验，通过开展试点项目来主动催化AI政策领域的科学共识。

Result: 识别了AI政策共识形成的机制缺失，并论证了NeurIPS是最适合承担这一角色的机构。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策领域发挥领导作用，通过推动科学共识来创造更高质量的AI政策。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文审计了视觉语言模型在保释决策预测中的表现，发现模型表现不佳且会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者。通过RAG管道引入法律先例和微调等干预措施，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统开始利用罪犯图像和文本案件报告，但这种方式可能带来意外后果和恶意使用。需要评估VLMs在保释决策预测中的效率。

Method: 首先审计独立VLMs在保释预测任务中的表现，然后设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例，并使用创新方案对VLMs进行微调。

Result: 发现VLMs在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，且会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者。干预措施显著提升了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在VLMs部署到真实世界法律判决预测之前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为AuditAgent的多智能体推理框架，用于金融欺诈检测中的细粒度证据链定位，在召回率和可解释性方面显著优于通用智能体方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的金融欺诈检测面临证据隐蔽且分散在多年财务披露中的挑战，需要专门的方法来定位细粒度证据链。

Method: 开发了AuditAgent多智能体推理框架，整合了主体级风险先验、混合检索策略和专门智能体模块，基于中国证监会发布的执法文件和财务报告构建专家标注数据集。

Result: 实验表明该方法在召回率和可解释性方面大幅优于通用智能体范式，为自动化、透明的金融取证建立了新基准。

Conclusion: 领域特定推理和数据集构建对于推进实际监管应用中的稳健金融欺诈检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出使用具身AI和大视觉语言模型为自主无人机提供实时常识推理能力，以应对突发事件的适应性决策，替代传统手工编码恢复规则的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手工编码大量恢复规则，但无法预测现实世界中的各种意外情况，且规则集很快变得不完整。需要更智能的适应性决策系统。

Method: 利用具身AI和大视觉语言模型提供常识推理能力，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态解释周围环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全着陆。

Result: 研究结果表明，具身AI使得以前无法手工设计的新型自适应恢复和决策流程成为可能，提高了自主空中系统的弹性和安全性。

Conclusion: 基于具身AI的方法能够为自主无人机系统提供实时、自适应的决策能力，显著提升系统在应对突发事件时的安全性和韧性。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Motivation: 旨在整合神经网络的感知能力和符号推理的可解释性，通过对象中心学习与案例推理的结合来提升图像分类性能。

Method: 使用Slot Attention进行对象中心特征提取，结合AA-CBR进行符号推理，包括特征组合策略、案例库缩减、基于计数的偏序关系、One-Vs-Rest多分类策略和支持性AA-CBR变体。

Result: 在CLEVR-Hans数据集上表现出色，与基线模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SAA-CBR是一种有效的图像分类器，成功融合了神经和符号方法，在保持性能的同时增强了可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Slot Attention Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (SAA-CBR),
a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline for image classification that integrates
object-centric learning via a neural Slot Attention (SA) component with
symbolic reasoning conducted by Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(AA-CBR). We explore novel integrations of AA-CBR with the neural component,
including feature combination strategies, casebase reduction via representative
samples, novel count-based partial orders, a One-Vs-Rest strategy for extending
AA-CBR to multi-class classification, and an application of Supported AA-CBR, a
bipolar variant of AA-CBR. We demonstrate that SAA-CBR is an effective
classifier on the CLEVR-Hans datasets, showing competitive performance against
baseline models.

### [217] [Thinkquel: A Model Dedicated to Text-to-dbt Using Synthetic Data and a Span-Aware Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00186)
*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成可靠、可移植且执行验证的数据库查询。它通过TS-SQL合成数据管道和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，解决了自然语言到SQL转换中的模式链接和SQL方言问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠的、生产就绪的数据转换仍然具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和仓库特定的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督——执行成功和结果匹配——仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型执行验证语料库成本高昂，且令牌级目标与这些全局信号不对齐，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了一个新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，以及一个跨度感知的强化学习目标Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO），专门设计用于在微调LLM时弥合令牌级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）通过两阶段SFT课程达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配，比基础模型提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO相对于GRPO和GSPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过结合合成数据生成和专门设计的强化学习目标，显著提高了自然语言到SQL转换的性能和稳定性，为生产环境中的可靠数据转换提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法，将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，通过专用LoRA适配器分别处理，显著提升了本地LLM在工具调用场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地大型语言模型在工具调用场景中表现不佳，特别是在大型工具集的选择和复杂参数结构的准确生成方面，需要隐私保护且成本效益高的本地推理解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调创建专用适配器，分别处理工具选择和工具特定参数生成，并实现分层编排以限制工具选择所需工具数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在大多数情况下优于其他类似规模的本地推理、非推理和微调模型，甚至优于2倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调方法有效解决了本地LLM在工具调用中的性能瓶颈，通过任务分解和专用适配器实现了显著的性能提升，为设备端智能体编排提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性方法扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和经验，提高关键状态发现速度和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习智能体在安全关键和多智能体环境中的决策过程可解释性挑战，克服现有方法在计算成本、探索覆盖和多智能体适应性方面的限制。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应ε-贪婪探索和轻量级智能体间协作，通过轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化框架。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，MAGIC-MASK在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程提供了局部化、可解释的解释，实现了从单智能体到多智能体系统的可解释性泛化。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

TL;DR: ICL引导虽然能提升特定任务性能，但会损害跨领域推理能力，造成"优化脆弱性"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL引导对跨领域认知能力的影响，特别是推理灵活性方面。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的6个变体（1个基线+5种ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛问题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上表现下降，谜题准确率降至10-43%（基线为43%），数学奥赛问题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL引导在效率和推理灵活性之间存在系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于大语言模型的智能体在工具选择中的偏见问题，提出了评估工具选择偏见的基准，分析了偏见来源，并提出了一种轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于市场上存在功能等效的工具提供商，如果工具选择存在系统性偏见，会降低用户体验并扭曲竞争，因此需要研究工具选择公平性问题。

Method: 构建包含多个功能等效工具类别的基准，测试7个模型的工具选择行为，通过控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露对选择的影响，并提出基于相关工具子集过滤和均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 发现模型存在不公平性：要么固定选择单一提供商，要么不成比例地偏好上下文列表中较早的工具。语义对齐是最强的选择预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，重复预训练暴露会放大偏见。提出的缓解方法能减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强型大语言模型公平部署的关键障碍，需要关注和解决这一重要问题。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI在对抗性高风险环境中的严重盲点，即使最先进的模型也难以在信息被武器化、错误不可逆的场景中有效运作，特别是在加密货币市场等真实世界部署中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在受控环境中评估任务完成度，但真实世界部署需要AI具备抵抗主动欺骗的韧性。加密货币市场在2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是测试AI在对抗性环境中能力的理想场景。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，在178个时间锚定任务上评估17个模型，要求智能体区分真相与操纵、在碎片化信息环境中导航，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆的财务决策。

Result: 结果显示基本能力差距：无工具时前沿模型准确率仅28%，工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于80%的人类基准。模型系统性地优先选择不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据，容易落入SEO优化的错误信息和社交媒体操纵的陷阱。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上表现优异，但在需要智能体在主动对抗环境中生存的场景中仍基本准备不足。对抗性鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件，CAIA基准为此提供了持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

TL;DR: 对分层推理模型进行批判性回顾，提出改进变体，在数独和迷宫任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在逻辑推理方面表现不佳，可能源于缺乏对潜在空间和循环推理等创造性应用的探索，需要深入研究新兴的分层推理模型

Method: 对分层推理模型进行批判性回顾，检查关键设计选择，提出改进变体

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上取得了比先前报告显著更好的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和进一步研究的有趣方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

TL;DR: 提出语义驱动的AI代理通信框架，包含语义自适应传输、语义轻量传输和语义自进化控制三大技术，解决动态环境和有限资源下的AI代理通信挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能服务快速发展，通信对象从人类转向AI代理，需要新范式实现实时感知、决策和协作。语义通信虽然前景广阔，但实际部署受限于动态环境和有限资源。

Method: 1. 语义自适应传输：使用真实或生成样本进行微调，使模型适应变化环境；2. 语义轻量传输：采用剪枝、量化和感知感知采样降低模型复杂度；3. 语义自进化控制：采用分布式分层决策优化多维资源，支持动态环境下的多代理协作。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案实现了更快的收敛速度和更强的鲁棒性，分布式分层优化方法显著优于传统决策方案。

Conclusion: 该框架在AI代理通信网络中具有重要潜力，能够有效应对动态环境和资源限制的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE框架，通过让智能体自由探索和演化现有基准任务，自动生成更高难度的新任务，并记录可验证的执行轨迹，以解决现有智能体基准测试快速达到天花板的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体基准测试面临新开发智能体快速达到性能上限的问题，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要更可持续和具有挑战性的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题形成与自由探索（将提案概念化为可行问题候选，智能体自由探索并记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试上的实验表明，TRACE框架能够持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、人工策划的基准测试向动态、自我演化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体开发提供了可持续且具有挑战性的发展路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

*Sarvesh Soni,Dina Demner-Fushman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了自动化评估AI系统回答患者健康问题的可行性，通过系统研究评估方法，发现精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——人工专家评审——劳动密集且缓慢，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标虽然前景广阔，但与人类判断的一致性不一且通常依赖于上下文。

Method: 在100个患者案例中，收集了28个AI系统的回答（共2800个），并从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否适当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为指标锚点。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明精心设计的自动化评估能够有效扩展AI系统的比较评估。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，并支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EDMS方法，通过增强状态表示和动作掩码机制，在足球等团队运动中构建可解释的玩家级智能体模型，将学习到的价值函数和策略映射到人类可理解的战术概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型虽然能预测但缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能从数据中学习，又具有战术可解释性且能在异构数据源中保持鲁棒性的玩家级智能体模型。

Method: 提出可扩展决策状态(EDMS)，通过关系变量（如空间评分、传球和得分）增强原始位置和速度信息，结合动作掩码方案为持球和非持球球员提供不同的决策集。

Result: EDMS结合动作掩码在实验中持续降低了动作预测损失和时间差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS方法成功将学习到的价值函数和策略映射到人类可理解的战术概念，与比赛规则对齐，并展示了与多个商业和开源数据集的兼容性。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了传统观点，发现在14个多样化领域中，生成式结果奖励模型(GenORM)比过程奖励模型(PRM)表现更稳健，而过程奖励模型在长推理轨迹中会累积错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。作者希望在不同领域全面评估四种奖励模型的性能。

Method: 在14个多样化领域统一评估四种奖励模型变体：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 发现DisORM与DisPRM表现相当，GenPRM不具竞争力，而GenORM在所有测试领域中都表现出显著且一致的性能提升，是最稳健的模型。

Conclusion: 细粒度监督并不总是更好，生成式结果验证在多领域部署中更具优势。过程奖励模型的逐步评分会从LLM自动标注中继承标签噪声，且在长推理轨迹中难以评估。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了VIRTUE模型，将分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力扩展到表示学习领域，支持视觉交互式区域指定，在36个通用MMEB任务和5个视觉交互SCaR任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法让用户通过点、边界框、掩码等方式指定感兴趣区域，限制了模型在局部定位用户意图方面的应用潜力。

Method: 结合分割模型处理视觉提示以精确定位图像特定区域，使嵌入器能更精确处理复杂和模糊场景，扩展视觉语言模型到表示学习领域。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力引入嵌入模型，解锁了新的应用场景，并通过学习图像内实体级信息来补充全局表示。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究针对RAG系统开发了15个数据质量维度，覆盖数据提取、转换、提示搜索和生成四个处理阶段，强调需要在前端加载质量管理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态多阶段特性，需要开发专门的数据质量维度。

Method: 对16家领先IT服务公司的从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳推导数据质量维度。

Result: 识别出15个不同的数据质量维度，分布在RAG系统的四个处理阶段，发现新维度主要集中在早期步骤，且数据质量问题会在管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 传统数据质量框架需要扩展以覆盖RAG环境，需要采用动态的、步骤感知的质量管理方法，并实施前端加载的质量管理策略。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散语言模型(DLMs)在迭代去噪过程中的关键安全漏洞，攻击者可通过注入肯定性令牌绕过安全防护，并提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法来缓解此漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，虽然能降低延迟并支持双向条件生成，但其推理机制带来的安全风险尚未被充分理解，特别是针对越狱攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 研究发现如果在中间步骤出现对有害查询的肯定性令牌，后续去噪过程可能被引导生成有害响应。基于此分析，提出了一种专门针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定性令牌的受污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明所提出的方法能显著缓解该漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，同时提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对扩散语言模型进行特定安全研究的必要性，揭示了其独特推理机制带来的新型安全风险。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent Context Optimization (ACON)框架，通过优化压缩指南来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少26-54%内存使用，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能体在动态环境中部署时，由于需要积累长历史动作和观察而导致的上下文长度增长问题，这会增加成本并降低长视野任务的效率。

Method: ACON框架通过自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化：在完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败的配对轨迹中，分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南，然后将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少26-54%峰值token内存使用，同时基本保持任务性能；蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率；提升较小LM作为长视野智能体的性能达46%。

Conclusion: ACON是一个有效的上下文压缩框架，能够显著减少内存使用而不牺牲性能，并能成功蒸馏到更小模型中，提升较小语言模型在长视野任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

TL;DR: HARPA是一个AI驱动的科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势，探索假设设计空间，并基于研究差距收敛到可测试假设。相比基线AI研究者，在可行性和基础性方面表现更优，并能通过奖励模型从先前实验结果中学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，且无法适应先前的实验结果。HARPA旨在通过模拟人类研究者的构思流程来解决这些挑战。

Method: HARPA采用三阶段方法：1）通过文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势；2）探索假设设计空间；3）通过定位研究差距和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试的假设。系统还学习奖励模型来基于先前实验结果对新假设进行评分。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)方面显著优于基线AI研究者。与ASD代理(CodeScientist)测试时，HARPA产生更多成功执行(20 vs 11/40)和更少失败(16 vs 21/40)。奖励模型相比未训练基线评分器获得约28%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: HARPA的方法在AI驱动科学发现领域向前迈进了一步，通过模拟人类研究者的构思流程，生成更可行、基础更扎实的假设，并能从实验经验中学习改进。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示当前模型编辑方法存在根本性缺陷，其表面可靠性建立在脆弱基础上，实际可能利用隐藏捷径而非真实语义进行知识更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型不可避免地编码过时或不正确的知识，更新、删除和遗忘这些知识对于对齐、安全等问题至关重要。模型编辑作为一种有前景的范式出现，但作者发现其可靠性基础脆弱，现有研究可能被虚幻的成功所驱动。

Method: 作者系统开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负例测试，以揭示模型编辑方法是否真正基于语义理解而非利用捷径。

Result: 研究发现，即使在最简单的否定查询下，最先进的模型编辑方法也会崩溃。经验证据表明编辑很可能基于捷径而非完整语义。

Conclusion: 模型编辑可能建立在捷径而非真实语义基础上，这直接挑战了当前模型编辑文献的可行性基础，需要在进一步推进前重新考虑其基本前提。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CDDM方法，通过协作渐进蒸馏技术将大模型知识转移到轻量级学生模型，实现实时轨迹预测，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少参数和采样步数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型尺寸大、采样速度慢，阻碍了实际部署。需要开发轻量高效的实时预测方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，逐步将教师扩散模型知识转移到学生模型，减少采样步数和模型尺寸，并引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失防止过拟合。

Result: 在ETH-UCY和nuScenes基准测试中达到SOTA精度，仅需231K参数和2-4采样步数，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟，保持96%以上基线性能。

Conclusion: CDDM成功将高性能生成模型与部署约束相结合，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统提供资源高效的轨迹预测解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

### [236] [Expected Attention: KV Cache Compression by Estimating Attention from Future Queries Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00636)
*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Expected Attention的训练免费KV缓存压缩方法，通过预测未来查询如何关注KV对来估计其重要性，解决了传统注意力分数压缩方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，传统基于注意力分数的压缩方法面临实际限制：未来token的注意力分数在压缩时不可用，且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整的注意力矩阵。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行原则性排序和剪枝，对残差流影响最小。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 开发了KVPress库，包含20多种技术，供研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Result: Batch-CAM在准确性和图像重建质量上同时提升，并减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过确保模型从证据相关信息中学习，为构建更透明、可解释和可信赖的AI系统做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种迭代式相关区域缩减方法，通过逐步限制搜索区域来减小相关区域的大小，从而提高策略重用和剪枝效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏求解中，相关区域的大小影响策略重用和剪枝效率，较小的相关区域更有利于提高求解效率。

Method: 设计了三种约束生成策略，并集成了相关区域模式表来充分利用过去的解，通过迭代求解相同位置并逐步限制参与区域来引导求解器找到更小的相关区域。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，平均相关区域大小减少到原来的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的相关区域可以作为可重用的知识永久存储，用于未来的求解任务，特别是在更大的棋盘尺寸或不同开局中。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有策略优化算法在视觉语言模型对齐中的局限性，如静态训练计划和PPO中僵化的统一裁剪机制。

Method: ACPO包含两个核心组件：1）动态课程学习，从近策略探索渐进过渡到离策略利用；2）优势感知自适应裁剪（AAAC），用动态样本级边界替代固定裁剪参数。

Result: 在MathVista、LogicVista和MMMU-Pro等基准测试中，ACPO持续优于DAPO和PAPO等基线方法，实现了最先进的性能、加速收敛和更好的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了复杂推理任务中视觉语言模型对齐的挑战，为大规模模型训练提供了更稳健和高效的优化框架。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的数据增强管道，通过对称性和难度两个维度增强定理证明模型的鲁棒性，并训练出在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平的非推理定理证明器EvolProver。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式定理证明中表现出潜力，但普遍存在泛化能力不足和对问题陈述微小变换敏感的问题，需要提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出三部分数据增强方法：EvolAST（基于抽象语法树的句法对称性增强）、EvolDomain（跨数学领域的语义对称性增强）和EvolDifficulty（难度演化生成新定理），并用增强数据训练7B参数的EvolProver模型。

Result: EvolProver在FormalMATH-Lite上达到53.8% pass@32的新SOTA，在MiniF2F-Test（69.8%）、Ineq-Comp-Seed（52.2%）和Ineq-Comp-Transformed（34.0%）上均为非推理模型的新SOTA，消融研究证实了数据增强管道的有效性。

Conclusion: 该数据增强管道显著提升了定理证明模型的鲁棒性和性能，在多个基准测试中超越了同类规模模型，包括推理型模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)方法，通过攻击DDIM轨迹路径来有效破坏恶意图像编辑，防御效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIM反演技术被恶意用于合成虚假内容，现有防御方法在破坏扩散过程方面效果有限，需要更有效的防御机制。

Method: 攻击DDIM反演轨迹路径，在迭代去噪过程中进行有效干扰。

Result: DIA方法在各种编辑方法上都超越了之前的防御方法，实现了更有效的破坏效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的AI恶意使用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

data science courses at Wageningen University, this research identifies both
the benefits and challenges associated with AI in the classroom. While AI tools
can streamline tasks and enhance learning, concerns arise regarding students'
overreliance on these technologies, potentially hindering the development of
essential cognitive and problem solving skills. The study highlights the
importance of responsible AI usage, ethical considerations, and the need for

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

Method: 在语义层面比较两种方法：加权知识库通过权重和成本函数，c-representations通过惩罚函数。分析在特定条件下两种方法能否生成相同的解释排序，并比较它们的推理关系

Result: 证明在某些条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，达到语义结构的相对成本等价。同时发现某些推理概念在两种形式化中可等价表达

Conclusion: 两种方法在语义层面存在等价关系，这一发现有助于加权知识库和c-representations两个领域的进一步研究

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当专家意见一致时无法排除任何可能的评估结果，但当意见分歧时至少有一方必然错误。这种不对称性启发了仅通过观察分类器间一致性和分歧来进行无监督评估的研究。

Method: 将分类器决策的对齐统计作为线性规划问题的输入，在整数空间中建模可能的正确或错误响应，利用逻辑约束（不等式）和普遍适用的线性等式（公理）来计算与观察到的决策一致的所有可能评估集合。

Result: 开发了无需知识的警报系统，能够仅基于逻辑一致性检测一个或多个LLM评委是否违反了用户指定的最低评分阈值。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了仅通过逻辑一致性进行无监督评估的实际效用，为在没有真实标签的情况下评估分类器性能提供了可行方案。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合，显著改善了操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency

### [249] [Learning Compact Representations of LLM Abilities via Item Response Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00844)
*Jianhao Chen,Chenxu Wang,Gengrui Zhang,Peng Ye,Lei Bai,Wei Hu,Yuzhong Qu,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于项目反应理论(IRT)的方法，通过学习LLM的紧凑能力表示来改进模型路由和性能预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型数量激增，如何有效管理和利用这些庞大资源成为重要挑战，需要学习紧凑的模型能力表示来支持下游任务。

Method: 采用项目反应理论框架，将模型正确回答查询的概率建模为三个因素的函数：模型的多技能能力向量、查询的区分度向量和难度标量，并使用混合专家网络联合学习这些参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在模型路由和基准精度预测任务上达到了最先进的性能，学习到的参数能够编码有意义且可解释的模型能力和查询特征信息。

Conclusion: 基于IRT的方法能够有效学习LLM的紧凑能力表示，为模型管理和利用提供了实用解决方案，且学习到的参数具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的自动洞察和数据探索方法AIDE，用于解决从数据中自动发现知识的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织面临将大量数据转化为可操作知识的困难，现有方法在处理数据量、提取隐含关系和考虑主观目标方面存在不足。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索框架开发AIDE系统，通过探索数据转换和模型构建来发现有趣的数据模式。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的评估表明，AIDE能有效识别数据转换和模型，揭示有价值的数据模式。

Conclusion: AIDE为自动知识发现提供了一个可扩展的基础框架，未来可集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了FusionAdapter方法用于多模态知识图谱中的少样本关系学习，通过适配器模块和融合策略有效整合多模态信息，在低资源场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将多模态对齐到共享空间，忽略了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 引入适配器模块使每个模态能高效适应未见关系，采用融合策略整合多模态实体表示同时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的实验表明，FusionAdapter优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合多模态信息，FusionAdapter能以最少监督改善对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DAIL算法，通过LLM引导的进化框架自动发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，显著提升了对抗模仿学习的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习(AIL)方法虽然有效，但被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计的改进，而奖励分配函数对训练动态和最终策略性能的影响被忽视。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架探索奖励分配函数空间，基于模仿策略性能直接发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，开发了首个元学习的AIL算法DAIL。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法上表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL实现了更稳定的训练，为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的分离方法在识别有效不等式时生成割集数量不足，因为模型对生成多样化子集的敏感性不够。

Method: 引入随机边选择到图粗化过程替代贪婪方法，并提出GraphCHiP算法利用粗化历史识别RCIs和FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，该方法相比现有神经分离方法能更有效地减少对偶间隙，并成功识别出有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 通过测试时搜索增强训练模型性能是有效的，能够生成更高质量的割集并识别新的不等式类型。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Abstract: In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving
both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network

suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market
behavior.

Motivation: 现有LLM生成的量子电路存在参数精度不足和领域知识缺乏的问题，需要解决量子门参数优化和电路布局的挑战。

Method: 采用工具增强的LLM结合强化学习框架，设计量子电路验证方法和分层奖励机制来优化生成的量子电路。

Conclusion: QUASAR框架有效提升了LLM生成量子电路的语法和语义性能，证明了工具增强和强化学习在量子计算领域的应用价值。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Motivation: 解决罕见病诊断中的数据稀缺、隐私保护和边缘设备资源有限等挑战。

Method: 结合元学习的少样本联邦优化、能量感知客户端调度和带校准差分隐私的安全聚合。

Result: 在模拟罕见病检测数据集上，相比基线联邦学习准确率提升10%，客户端掉线率降低50%以上，隐私-效用权衡在临床可接受范围内。

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决售后需求预测中的复杂性和不确定性，特别是在考虑多种外部信号（如安装基数、定价、宏观经济指标等）以及COVID-19等特殊事件的影响时，需要一个统一的框架来提供准确的预测和可操作的洞察。

Method: 采用收入感知和聚类感知的模型集成方法，结合外生信号输入，将COVID-19视为独立制度。通过帕累托感知分割对高收入项目单独预测，对长尾项目进行聚类预测。使用水平感知集成方法，根据业务相关损失（如WMAPE）调整权重。

Conclusion: 该架构通过可重复的工作流程和AI生成的叙述，帮助规划者从关注当前准确性转向预测准确性趋势并确定需要调整的杠杆，从而在90多个国家和约6000个零件的范围内实现预测、监控和库存决策的闭环。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

Motivation: 现有方法专注于发现特定特征的特定几何结构，缺乏泛化能力，需要一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形。

Method: 引入监督多维缩放（SMDS）方法，这是一种模型无关的技术，用于自动发现特征流形。

Result: 发现不同特征形成各种几何结构（圆形、直线、簇），这些结构：一致反映概念属性；在不同模型家族和规模中稳定；主动支持模型推理；随上下文变化动态重塑。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了特征流形的功能作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，其中语言模型编码和转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数量影响有限。现有基准测试无法完全捕捉人类-AI对齐度。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多种计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示能力的模型最关键。现有基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐度。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估了70多个不同计算要素的模型，比较人类和模型的概念表示。

Result: 经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最对齐；多模态预训练和参数量对对齐度影响有限；现有基准测试中MMLU比MUSR更适合捕捉表示对齐，但都无法完全解释对齐度方差。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的关键计算要素，同时指出了LLM评估中基准测试的重要缺陷。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭与遮挡部分对应的模型组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因生成分布外图像而导致解释质量不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成突变体，导致分布外图像，影响解释质量。同时，选择合适的遮挡值需要领域知识，这限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出了ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法不需要额外训练或微调，通过关闭与遮挡区域对应的模型组件来移除这些特征对决策的影响。

Result: 实验评估显示，AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上相比传统遮挡方法，鲁棒性提高了高达62.5%，且不需要领域知识来选择遮挡值。

Conclusion: ConvAD机制能够提取更鲁棒的解释，不改变网络的决策过程，且无需领域知识或额外训练，为图像分类器的解释提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Conclusion: 该框架为将可信叙事解释转化为形式化可验证程序提供了方法学，有助于构建更可靠可信的AI系统。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: SIRL利用LLM内部的安全直觉作为奖励信号进行强化学习，无需外部验证器或人工标注，就能有效防御各种越狱攻击，同时保持其他任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和可靠的内容验证器，确保LLM安全面临挑战，难以获得有效的训练信号。研究发现对齐模型已具备强大的内部安全信念。

Method: 提出SIRL方法，将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自生成奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来教导模型信任其安全直觉。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个未标注提示就超越了资源密集的监督方法。

Conclusion: 有效对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: 提出一个双层生产计划框架，结合约束规划和强化学习，同时优化运营效率和员工公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业制造中平衡运营效率和员工公平性，将人力资源因素整合到生产计划中

Method: 第一层使用约束编程(CP)进行订单-产线分配，第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，比较了贪心分配、MCTS和RL三种策略

Result: CP调度产生紧凑可行的生产计划，MDP分配显著提高公平性和偏好匹配度，领域专家评价系统有效

Conclusion: CP与学习决策结合为以人为本的生产计划提供了稳健方法，能同时优化吞吐量和员工福祉

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult是一个临床医生对齐的专家小组架构，将紧凑的PRISM序列模型扩展为路由的领域专家家族，通过轻量级路由器将病例分派到不同专科模型，实现参数效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在急诊科环境中实现安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模会诊，需要开发一个能够高效处理不同医学专科病例的框架。

Method: 将病例标记化为结构化临床事件，使用轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分派到专科模型（心脏血管、肺部、胃肠食管、肌肉骨骼、心理源性），每个专科继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专科模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高路由质量和大量计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模会诊提供了实用路径，并概述了满足前瞻性临床部署标准的验证步骤。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

TL;DR: Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker是一个150亿参数的多模态推理模型，通过渐进式三阶段训练方法，在不依赖大规模计算资源的情况下实现了前沿性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在证明通过精心设计的训练方法而非单纯扩大规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿水平的多模态推理能力，使更多组织能够获得高性能模型。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进方法：1)深度扩展推理能力；2)分阶段持续预训练，先建立文本和视觉基础理解，再通过合成数据增强视觉推理；3)高质量文本监督微调，包含显式推理轨迹。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当；在10个图像基准测试中平均性能仅比Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7低5分，可在单GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 精心设计的中期训练方法可以在不依赖大规模计算的情况下显著缩小能力差距，使前沿多模态推理能力对基础设施有限的组织更加可及。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance
open-source research.

TL;DR: Bridge方法通过将批量LLM隐藏状态重新构想为整体张量而非独立切片，在并行生成中创建相互依赖的响应，仅需少量额外参数即可显著提升响应质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，N个并行响应通常相互独立生成，这导致计算资源分割且无法利用其他生成中的有用信息，限制了响应质量和响应集的质量提升。

Method: 提出Bridge方法，通过重新设计批量LLM隐藏状态为整体张量而非独立切片，在并行生成中创建相互依赖的响应，仅需添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%）。

Result: Bridge将基于可验证奖励的强化学习的相对平均准确率增益提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。一次训练即可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能均优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间的信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术，为并行LLM推理提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

TL;DR: 该论文研究在分析师可以操纵统计研究的情况下，如何设计基于独立数据源的激励支付方案来确保真实信息被披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师在不受监督的情况下可能操纵统计研究，需要设计激励支付方案来确保其报告真实信息。

Method: 使用基于独立数据源的统计实验模型，设计适当的激励支付方案来引导分析师披露真实信息。

Result: 确定了可以通过适当激励方案获取的信息类型，比较了不同实验在信息获取能力上的差异，发现数据在激励和统计推断中的使用方式不同。

Conclusion: 用于估计的数据也适用于激励引导，但反之不成立，这揭示了数据作为激励生成器与统计推断工具的不同作用。

Abstract: An analyst is tasked with producing a statistical study. The analyst is not
monitored and is able to manipulate the study. He can receive payments
contingent on his report and trusted data collected from an independent source,
modeled as a statistical experiment. We describe the information that can be
elicited with appropriately shaped incentives, and apply our framework to a
variety of common statistical models. We then compare experiments based on the
information they enable us to elicit. This order is connected to, but different
from, the Blackwell order. Data preferred for estimation are also preferred for
elicitation, but not conversely. Our results shed light on how using data as
incentive generator in payment schemes differs from using data for statistical
inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于竞赛理论的三项全能简化模型，将其建模为顺序两阶段博弈，分析游泳跟骑对运动员参与决策和努力水平的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三项全能比赛中游泳跟骑（drafting）如何影响运动员的参与决策和后续比赛中的努力水平，建立理论模型来分析这种顺序决策过程。

Method: 构建顺序两阶段博弈模型：第一阶段（游泳后）运动员决定是否继续比赛，第二阶段（自行车-跑步）采用Tullock竞赛模型，游泳跟骑作为二次努力成本的乘性转移因子。

Result: 推导出双人情况下的闭式均衡策略，证明了非对称n人情况下均衡的存在性、唯一性和比较静态性质，游泳跟骑强度产生运动员特定的截止规则。

Conclusion: 游泳跟骑的收益、暴露程度和群体规模与异质有效成本参数和均衡努力水平相关，模型揭示了参与决策的内生性对竞赛结果的影响。

Abstract: This paper introduces a contest-theoretic simplified model of triathlon as a
sequential two-stage game. In Stage 1 (post-swim), participants decide whether
to continue or withdraw from the contest, thereby generating an endogenous
participation decision. In Stage 2 (bike-run), competition is represented as a
Tullock contest in which swim drafting acts as a multiplicative shifter of
quadratic effort costs. Closed-form equilibrium strategies are derived in the
two-player case, and existence, uniqueness, and comparative statics are shown
in the asymmetric n-player case. The continuation decision yields
athlete-specific cutoff rules in swim drafting intensity and induces
subgame-perfect equilibria (SPEs) with endogenous participation sets. The
analysis relates swim drafting benefits, exposure, and group size to
heterogeneous effective cost parameters and equilibrium efforts.
