### [1] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，通过将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重，使LLM能够回答知道的问题而拒绝回答不知道的问题，显著减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉，自信地提供错误答案而不是承认无知。现有方法需要实时监控和干预，限制了实际应用。

Method: CASAL连接可解释性与摊销优化，仅训练单个Transformer层的子模块，将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重。

Result: CASAL在多个短问答基准上将幻觉减少30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍，并能有效泛化到分布外领域。

Conclusion: CASAL是将可解释性启发方法应用于生产系统实际部署的有前景的一步，适用于密集模型和MoE模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

### [2] [Hallucination-Resistant, Domain-Specific Research Assistant with Self-Evaluation and Vector-Grounded Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02326)
*Vivek Bhavsar,Joseph Ereifej,Aravanan Gurusami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RA-FSM是一个基于GPT的研究助手，采用有限状态机控制循环（相关性→置信度→知识）来减少幻觉和错误引用，通过向量检索和确定性引用管道提供可靠的技术文献分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文献合成中能加速工作，但存在幻觉和错误引用问题，限制了在专家工作流程中的实用性。需要开发能够提供透明、有据可查答案的系统。

Method: 构建模块化GPT研究助手，采用有限状态机控制循环，结合向量检索和确定性引用管道。控制器过滤超出范围查询、评分可回答性、分解问题，仅在需要时触发检索，输出带置信度标签和去重引用的答案。

Result: 在光子学领域的盲测A/B评估中，领域专家更偏好RA-FSM，认为其边界条件处理更强，证据使用更可靠。覆盖度和新颖性分析显示RA-FSM能探索超越NLM的内容，同时具有可调节的延迟和成本开销。

Conclusion: RA-FSM设计强调为高风险技术工作提供透明、充分引用的答案，可推广到其他科学领域，有效解决了LLM在专业应用中的幻觉和引用问题。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

### [3] [KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02327)
*So Kuroki,Yotaro Kubo,Takuya Akiba,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种混合架构，结合直接语音到语音模型的低延迟优势和级联系统的知识丰富性，通过实时注入LLM文本来指导语音生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时语音对话系统中低延迟与深度知识理解之间的权衡问题，级联系统延迟高但知识丰富，而直接S2S模型响应快但缺乏深度语义理解。

Method: 采用混合架构：用户语音同时输入S2S变换器实现即时响应，同时将查询发送给后端LLM，将LLM的文本响应实时注入以指导S2S模型的语音生成。

Result: 在语音合成的MT-Bench基准测试中，系统在响应正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，同时保持与基线相当的延迟。

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功平衡了实时响应性和知识丰富性，为语音对话系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

### [4] [AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02328)
*Ziqing Wang,Chengsheng Mao,Xiaole Wen,Yuan Luo,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMANDA是一个无需训练的多智能体框架，通过LLM智能体增强医学知识，解决Med-MLLMs在低资源医疗视觉问答中的内在和外在推理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-MLLMs在低资源环境下表现不佳，存在两个推理瓶颈：内在推理瓶颈忽略医学图像细节，外在推理瓶颈无法整合专业医学知识。

Method: 提出训练免费的AMANDA框架，通过内在医学知识增强（粗到细问题分解）和外在医学知识增强（生物医学知识图谱检索）来提升推理能力。

Result: 在8个Med-VQA基准测试中，零样本和少样本设置下均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了Med-MLLMs的推理瓶颈问题，在低资源医疗视觉问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

### [5] [SelfJudge: Faster Speculative Decoding via Self-Supervised Judge Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02329)
*Kanghoon Yoon,Minsub Kim,Sungjae Lee,Joonhyung Lee,Sunghyeon Woo,Yeonjun In,Se Jung Kwon,Chanyoung Park,Dongsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过目标模型自监督训练判断验证器，放宽推测解码的验证标准，在保持语义的前提下接受与目标模型输出有轻微差异的候选标记，实现了更好的推理速度与准确率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判断解码方法依赖人工标注或可验证真实答案的任务，限制了在不同NLP任务中的通用性，需要一种能自动训练验证器的方法。

Method: 通过目标模型自监督训练判断验证器，评估标记替换后的响应是否保持原始响应的语义，实现跨任务自动验证器训练。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理速度与准确率权衡方面优于判断解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为加速LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

### [6] [EntropyLong: Effective Long-Context Training via Predictive Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02330)
*Junlong Jia,Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Chaochen Gao,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu,Binghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EntropyLong方法，通过预测不确定性验证长距离依赖关系质量，构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据，显著提升模型在长上下文任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型训练方法（如通用文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）经常无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法来捕获长距离依赖。

Method: 利用预测不确定性识别文档中的高熵位置，从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文，并通过评估是否降低预测熵来验证其效用，采用模型在环验证确保每个依赖代表可测量的信息增益。

Result: 使用FineWebEdu和Cosmopedia构建了128K长度序列的数据集，训练出的模型在RULER基准测试中显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务上。指令微调后在LongBenchv2上也取得显著增益。

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，EntropyLong方法能够构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据，提升模型的长上下文理解能力。

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

### [7] [Synthetic Dialogue Generation for Interactive Conversational Elicitation & Recommendation (ICER)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02331)
*Moonkyung Ryu,Chih-Wei Hsu,Yinlam Chow,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh,Craig Boutilier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用行为模拟器和语言模型提示来生成与用户底层状态一致的自然对话的方法，以解决对话推荐系统中公开数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在对话推荐系统中具有巨大潜力，但公开的CRS数据稀缺使得微调语言模型变得困难。现有的用户模拟器作为数据生成器往往缺乏行为一致性，生成的对话序列与真实用户不一致。

Method: 开发了一种结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示的方法，生成与用户底层状态一致的自然对话。通过这种方法创建了一个包含偏好引导和示例批评的大型开源CRS数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成的对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量的对话推荐系统数据，为训练语言模型提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

### [8] [A High-Capacity and Secure Disambiguation Algorithm for Neural Linguistic Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02332)
*Yapei Feng,Feng Jiang,Shanhao Wu,Hua Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出look-ahead Sync方法，在保持SyncPool可证明安全性的同时显著提升神经语言隐写术的嵌入容量，英语和中文的嵌入率分别提高160%和25%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SyncPool方法因使用整个模糊候选组的香农熵进行同步而牺牲嵌入容量的问题

Method: 仅在真正不可区分的token序列上进行最小化同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量

Result: 实验表明该方法在英语和中文基准测试中持续接近理论容量上限，显著优于SyncPool

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写术迈出的重要一步

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

### [9] [Human Mobility Datasets Enriched With Contextual and Social Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02333)
*Chiara Pugliese,Francesco Lettich,Guido Rocchietti,Chiara Renso,Fabio Pinelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个包含语义增强的人类轨迹数据集，结合了GPS轨迹、停留点、移动模式、POI、交通方式推断、天气数据，以及LLM生成的社交媒体帖子，支持多模态语义移动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动数据集缺乏语义丰富性和多模态数据整合，需要结合真实世界移动数据、结构化语义增强、LLM生成文本和语义网兼容性。

Method: 从OpenStreetMap获取公开GPS轨迹，构建包含停留点、移动、POI、交通方式推断、天气数据的上下文层，并使用LLM生成合成社交媒体帖子，提供表格和RDF两种格式。

Result: 创建了覆盖巴黎和纽约两个结构不同大城市的语义增强轨迹数据集，支持行为建模、移动预测、知识图谱构建和LLM应用等研究任务。

Conclusion: 这是首个将真实世界移动、结构化语义增强、LLM生成文本和语义网兼容性结合的可重用框架资源，提供了开源可复现的数据集构建管道。

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

### [10] [Where Did It Go Wrong? Attributing Undesirable LLM Behaviors via Representation Gradient Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02334)
*Zhe Li,Wei Zhao,Yige Li,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于表示和梯度的新框架，用于诊断LLM中的不良行为，如生成有害内容、事实错误和社会偏见，通过分析激活空间提供语义上有意义的信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参数梯度的归因方法由于噪声信号和计算复杂性而不足，需要一种更有效的方法来诊断LLM失败的根本原因。

Method: 引入一种直接在模型激活空间中操作的新框架，分析表示及其梯度，将输出与训练数据联系起来。

Result: 该方法在追踪有害内容、检测后门投毒和识别知识污染等任务中表现出色，不仅能进行样本级归因，还能实现细粒度的token级分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解、审计和最终减轻与LLM相关的风险提供了一个强大的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

### [11] [FormalML: A Benchmark for Evaluating Formal Subgoal Completion in Machine Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02335)
*Xiao-Wen Yang,Zihao Zhang,Jianuo Cao,Zhi Zhou,Zenan Li,Lan-Zhe Guo,Yuan Yao,Taolue Chen,Yu-Feng Li,Xiaoxing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了FormalML基准，用于评估LLM在数学证明子目标补全任务中的表现，发现现有方法在准确性和效率方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为数学家助手的能力，特别是填补复杂证明中缺失步骤的子目标补全任务，目前这方面研究不足。

Method: 引入FormalML基准，使用Lean 4构建，通过翻译策略将过程式证明转换为声明式形式，提取4937个优化和概率不等式问题。

Result: 对最先进证明器的评估显示，在准确性和效率方面存在持续局限性。

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标补全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

Motivation: 虽然高资源语言有丰富的语义文本相似度资源，但低资源语言如库尔德语仍然缺乏相关数据集和评估基准。

Method: 创建了10,000个库尔德语句子对数据集，涵盖正式和非正式语域，每个句子对都标注了相似度。评估了Sentence-BERT、多语言BERT等强基线模型。

Result: 获得了有竞争力的结果，同时突出了库尔德语形态、拼写变体和语码混合带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线建立了一个可复现的评估套件，为库尔德语语义学和低资源NLP的未来研究提供了良好的起点。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

### [13] [CRACQ: A Multi-Dimensional Approach To Automated Document Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02337)
*Ishak Soltani,Francisco Belo,Bernardo Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，用于评估文档的五个特质：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。它基于特质自动作文评分方法，扩展到机器生成文本，提供基于评分标准的可解释自动评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单分数评估方法无法提供细粒度的特质分析，需要开发一个能够同时提供整体和特质层面评估的多维框架。

Method: 基于特质自动作文评分方法，整合语言、语义和结构信号，使用500个合成资助提案进行训练，并与LLM作为评判者进行基准测试。

Result: 初步结果表明，CRACQ比直接LLM评估产生更稳定和可解释的特质层面判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ提供了一个有前景的多维评估框架，能够对机器生成文本进行更细致和可解释的评估，但需要进一步改进可靠性和扩展领域适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

### [14] [Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02338)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和DocLens的强化学习框架，用于临床文本生成，直接优化事实准确性和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档需要与完整性和事实准确性等优先级精确对齐，现有方法存在训练成本高和依赖人工参考的问题。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合DocLens（基于对话的确定性奖励评估器）的强化学习框架，采用简单的奖励门控策略。

Result: 提高了临床笔记质量，减少了训练成本，GPT-5定性评估显示在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面GRPO输出更受偏好，遗漏和幻觉更少。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到实际应用场景，并能整合自定义目标如指南遵循或计费偏好，改进效果可能代表保守的下限估计。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的重要性日益增长，不确定性量化对于保证其可靠性至关重要。本文探索在可解释的论证性LLM框架中集成UQ方法，以提升决策的可靠性。

Method: 在论证性LLMs中集成不同的LLM不确定性量化方法，并在声明验证任务上进行实验评估，同时这也提供了一种评估UQ方法有效性的新途径。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管直接提示法很简单，但在ArgLLMs中是一种有效的UQ策略，性能显著优于更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 直接提示法在论证性LLMs的不确定性量化中表现出色，为复杂和有争议的声明验证提供了有效的UQ解决方案。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过提示让大语言模型模拟早期知识截止的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询时有效，但在因果相关知识遗忘方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间预测任务中依赖预训练数据可能产生污染问题，准确预测可能反映的是记忆而非推理能力，导致对其泛化能力的高估。

Method: 构建三个评估数据集来测试LLMs遗忘直接事实知识、语义变化和因果相关知识的能力，使用基于提示的遗忘技术模拟早期知识截止。

Result: 提示模拟的知识截止在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在需要遗忘因果相关内容而非直接询问时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在将LLMs应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置，提示方法在模拟知识遗忘方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种基于用户不满意信号的迭代偏好训练方法，利用真实世界中的用户修正和偏好表达来训练语言模型，相比传统方法在多个基准测试中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型部署会产生大量隐式用户不满意信号（如修正、重写），而显式满意反馈稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配。

Method: DRIFT方法以真实世界的不满意信号为基础，从不断演化的策略中动态采样正样本进行训练，避免梯度退化问题。

Result: 在WildBench和AlpacaEval2基准测试中，7B和14B模型分别获得显著提升，14B模型甚至超过GPT-4o-mini在WildBench上的表现。

Conclusion: DRIFT是有效且可扩展的后训练方法，能够利用最丰富和最有信息量的用户信号，同时保持模型的探索能力。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

TL;DR: 提出了SIMPACT框架和BluePrint数据集，用于构建行为基础的社会媒体数据集，支持LLM作为真实社交媒体代理的训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏用于微调和评估LLM作为真实社交媒体代理的标准化数据资源，需要解决这一空白。

Method: 引入SIMPACT框架，将下一动作预测作为训练和评估LLM代理的任务，使用聚类和人口级别指标评估行为保真度和风格真实性。

Result: 发布了基于Bluesky数据的BluePrint大规模数据集，包含12种社交媒体互动类型，支持上下文依赖的代理开发。

Conclusion: SIMPACT为推进严谨、符合伦理的社交媒体模拟提供了基础，BluePrint可作为政治话语建模的评估基准和领域特定数据集的模板。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决MoE LLMs的负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销三难问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE大语言模型面临的三个核心问题：负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销，这些因素限制了MoE模型的可扩展性和实际部署效率。

Method: 使用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似度定期重组专家；在聚类内将专家权重分解为共享基础矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；采用两阶段分层路由策略和异构精度方案。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上评估，与标准MoE模型质量相当，同时总参数量减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低超过3倍。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效且内存有效的MoE LLMs的原则性路径，证明了通过动态架构重配置可以获得显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Result: 研究发现，通过适当的提示和针对性检索，小型语言模型能够提供与大型语言模型相媲美的准确且符合教学要求的回答，同时具有更低的计算和能源需求。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型因其较低的计算和能源需求，能够在消费级硬件上实时运行，不依赖云基础设施，是教育机构实现可持续、节能的个性化学习扩展的可行AI教学助手选择。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

TL;DR: 提出了mini-vec2vec方法，作为vec2vec的高效替代方案，显著降低计算成本并提高稳定性，同时保持或超越原方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec方法虽然能实现近乎完美的文本嵌入空间对齐，但存在计算成本高和不稳定的问题，需要更高效可靠的替代方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：伪并行嵌入向量的初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代优化，学习到的映射是线性变换。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原vec2vec方法提高数个数量级，同时匹配或超越了其性能结果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有稳定性和可解释的算法步骤，便于扩展，为在新领域和学科中的应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在为LLM时代提供更干净的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询文本，解决了原始数据集的结构和标注问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥了关键作用，但由于存在大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构和标注问题，其使用率下降。需要为LLM时代创建更合适的基准数据集。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法。将原始数据集转换为提供干净自然语言问题和完整SQL查询文本的格式。

Result: 创建了LLMSQL基准数据集，评估了包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B、gpt-oss 20B、Phi-3.5 Mini、Qwen 2.5、OpenAI o4-mini、DeepSeek R1等多个大语言模型。

Conclusion: LLMSQL作为LLM就绪的基准数据集，与专为指针网络模型设计的原始WikiSQL不同，它提供了干净的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询文本，便于现代自然语言到SQL模型的直接生成和评估。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在政治话语中评估冒犯性时，能够通过明确推理能力更好地适应不同意识形态和文化视角，而较小模型则难以捕捉细微差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在采用特定政治和文化视角时如何评估政治话语中的冒犯性，特别是在多语言和多元意识形态背景下。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举推文的多语言子集，评估多个LLM从不同政治人物视角（极右翼、保守派、中间派、进步派）判断推文冒犯性，涵盖英语、波兰语和俄语语境。

Result: 具有明确推理能力的大型模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感，而较小模型往往无法捕捉细微区别。推理能力显著提高了冒犯性判断的个性化和可解释性。

Conclusion: 推理机制是使LLM适应跨语言和意识形态的精细社会政治文本分类的关键，特别是在处理政治话语中的冒犯性评估时。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Motivation: 语音对话模型中的偏见研究尚不充分，副语言特征（如年龄、性别、口音）可能影响模型输出，多轮对话可能加剧偏见，影响决策和推荐任务的公平性。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数(GUS)评估决策偏见，相似性归一化统计率(SNSR)评估推荐偏见，测试开源模型(Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice)和闭源API(GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash)，分析多轮对话中重复负面反馈的影响。

Result: 闭源模型总体偏见较低，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，偏见在多轮对话中持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究端到端语音对话模型偏见的工作，为构建公平可靠的音频交互系统提供见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码以促进后续研究。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

database was developed, which contains 2,872 nodes and 10,774 relationships,
aiding in the visualization of interconnections within legal texts. In
addition, advanced triple extraction techniques were utilized for knowledge,
demonstrating the effectiveness of models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4, and

Motivation: 探讨语言皮层中语义表征的抽象程度，验证是否存在形式独立的抽象意义表征。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型生成句子对应的图像和释义，提取嵌入向量来预测语言皮层的神经响应，比较单图像/释义与多图像/释义聚合的效果。

Result: 多图像聚合和多释义平均能显著提高预测准确度，甚至超过大型语言模型；丰富上下文细节的释义能进一步提升预测效果。

Conclusion: 语言皮层中存在高度抽象、形式独立的语义表征，其表征比语言模型更丰富和广泛。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

TL;DR: DiffuSpec是一个无需训练的直接替换框架，使用预训练扩散语言模型在单次前向传递中生成多令牌草案，通过因果一致性路径搜索和自适应草案长度控制器解决扩散模型特有的挑战，实现高达3倍的实时加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，自回归解码的串行特性导致延迟增加。现有推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草案器，限制了实际加速效果。

Method: 使用预训练扩散语言模型生成多令牌草案，引入因果一致性路径搜索从令牌网格中提取左到右路径，以及自适应草案长度控制器根据接受反馈调整提案大小。

Result: 在基准测试中，DiffuSpec实现了高达3倍的实时加速，证明了基于扩散的草案生成是自回归草案器的可靠替代方案。

Conclusion: 扩散式草案生成为推测解码提供了稳健的替代方案，显著提升了推理速度，同时保持与标准自回归验证器的兼容性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前排放相关知识分散且高度专业化，现有获取和编译排放数据的方法效率低下，这阻碍了非专家解读排放信息，给研究和管理带来挑战。

Method: 基于精心策划的知识库，集成提示工程和问题补全技术，支持自然语言交互分析排放数据，包括查询可视化清单、分析来源贡献、推荐排放因子等。

Conclusion: Emission-GPT的模块化和可扩展架构促进了传统手动工作流程的自动化，使其成为下一代排放清单开发和情景评估的基础工具。

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型群体中会出现类似沉默螺旋的现象，当同时提供历史信息和角色信息时，会产生强烈的多数意见主导模式，重现沉默螺旋动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本用于解释人类社会中的少数意见沉默现象，但该理论不直接适用于LLM。研究旨在探索在纯粹统计语言生成的LLM群体中是否会出现类似沉默螺旋的动态。

Method: 提出评估框架，系统控制'历史'和'角色'信号的可用性，使用趋势测试和集中度测量分析意见动态，在开源和闭源模型上进行实验。

Result: 历史和角色信号共同产生强烈的多数主导并复制沉默螺旋模式；仅历史信号导致强烈锚定效应；仅角色信号产生多样但无关联的意见。

Conclusion: 研究连接计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和缓解LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔训练框架，通过QK适配器和块适配器解决Transformer自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但由于自注意力机制对输入token的二次复杂度，面临严重的计算效率问题。现有基于块选择和压缩的方法存在语义不完整或训练推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出ChunkLLM框架，包含两个组件：QK适配器（Q-Adapter和K-Adapter）用于特征压缩和块注意力获取，块适配器（Chunk Adapter）用于检测块边界。训练时仅训练适配器参数，骨干网络参数冻结，并设计了注意力蒸馏方法。推理时仅在检测到块边界时触发块选择。

Result: 在多个长短文本基准数据集上的实验表明，ChunkLLM在短文本基准上达到可比性能，在长上下文基准上保持98.64%性能，同时保持48.58%的KV缓存保留率。在处理120K长文本时，相比原始Transformer获得最高4.48倍加速。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer的计算效率问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，为长文本处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过测试多个大语言模型在不同语言和上下文环境中回答罗马尼亚历史争议问题的表现，评估其偏见程度。研究发现模型在二元回答和数值评分之间存在不一致性，且回答稳定性因语言而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到历史通常通过被改变的观点呈现，主要受国家文化和理想影响，大语言模型也可能因训练数据集的特定模糊性而缺乏中立性，从而影响用户认知。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：首先让LLM对给定问题给出肯定回答，然后要求以数值量表形式回答相同问题，以验证预期回答类型对回答本身的影响。

Result: 二元回答稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异。模型经常在不同语言或格式之间改变立场；数值评分经常与初始二元选择不同；最一致的模型并不总是被认为最准确或中立的。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言语境下存在不一致性的倾向，表明大语言模型在历史问题回答中存在偏见和不稳定性。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

TL;DR: 本文提出了实例级上下文学习(ILCL)方法，通过智能探索和验证环境中的具体事实，为LLM智能体创建可重用的上下文文档，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但忽略了实例级上下文(如物体位置、配方等具体事实)，这导致在复杂任务中经常失败。

Method: 使用TODO森林进行引导式探索，结合轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环，自动生成高精度的可重用上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示，ReAct的平均成功率从37%提升到95%，IGE从81%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可重用的知识，该方法补充了现有上下文，使LLM智能体更加可靠和高效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究训练条件如何影响语言模型使用上下文知识和参数知识，以及它们之间的仲裁策略。通过在合成传记语料上的实验发现，文档内事实重复、信息不一致和分布偏斜等非理想属性有助于模型学习鲁棒的仲裁策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理推理时检索的上下文知识和预训练获得的参数知识时存在冲突。当前缺乏对训练过程中知识仲裁策略形成机制的系统理解，这可能导致预训练模型产生不良仲裁行为，浪费计算资源。

Method: 在合成传记语料上训练基于transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏斜等。

Result: 实验表明：文档内事实重复促进参数和上下文能力的发展；包含不一致信息或分布偏斜的语料训练鼓励模型开发鲁棒的参数和上下文知识利用策略；这些非理想属性对学习鲁棒仲裁很重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果为预训练模型和谐整合参数和上下文知识提供了具体实证指导，表明传统认为需要去除的非理想语料属性实际上有助于模型学习更鲁棒的仲裁策略。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种内存增强的小型语言模型架构，通过访问大型分层参数化内存库来存储世界知识，在推理时仅提取少量上下文相关内存块，实现了参数效率的大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型的性能提升依赖于参数扩展，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既没必要也不实用，特别是对于边缘设备来说内存和计算资源有限。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和预训练策略，构建小型语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库，在预训练和推理时提取上下文相关的内存块，让内存参数存储长尾世界知识，小型模型作为锚点捕获通用知识和推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（来自4.6B内存库）的性能可与参数多2倍以上的常规模型相媲美，成功将参数化内存扩展到超过21B参数。

Conclusion: 分层前馈内存方法在各种transformer架构中都能稳健工作，无论是在预训练期间添加还是事后添加，为构建参数高效的语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中，从多个LLM中选择最可靠响应仍然具有挑战性，现有方法依赖昂贵的外部验证器或需要多次采样，而多LLM系统虽然能产生更多样化响应，但通常表现不如单一LLM的自一致性方法。

Method: 使用校准的对数似然分数来隐式利用这些模型的固有知识和置信度，从多个不同LLM中选择最佳响应。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU（6个子集）和ARC数据集上，在辩论（多轮LLM讨论）和非辩论（多LLM最佳选择）设置中分别实现了约4%、3%和5%的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性、新颖且计算高效的方式，能够有效利用多LLM系统的潜力，在资源受限环境下实现更好的响应选择性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets
respectively.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统主要依赖非结构化文档，忽略了关系数据库提供的精确、及时且高效查询的事实信息，特别是在金融、医疗和科研等领域。

Method: 采用规则驱动路由框架：路由代理基于显式规则评分候选增强路径；规则制定专家代理通过QA反馈优化规则；路径级元缓存重用相似查询的路由决策以减少延迟和成本。

Result: 在三个QA基准测试中，该框架持续优于静态策略和学习路由基线，实现了更高的准确性，同时保持适度的计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过系统规则指导路由决策，可以有效结合数据库和文档的互补优势，在领域特定问答中实现准确性和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型的知识更新机制，解决当前评估不足、孤立和小规模的问题，理解LLMs是否像人类一样修改知识，以及编辑和遗忘在训练数据增加时的差异。

Method: 提出KnowledgeSmith框架，将知识编辑和机器遗忘建模为约束优化问题，开发自动数据集生成器，提供跨多个图层次和数据规模的结构化干预，研究不同修改策略在模型知识中的传播。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠和可扩展的知识更新策略提供了建议，揭示了LLMs知识更新的独特特性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Conclusion: 数据库级别的结构化领域声明结合子字符串匹配检索方法能够有效提升LLM在自然语言到SQL转换任务中的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Motivation: 测试纯文本训练的LLM是否隐含地包含了多模态规律，以及是否可以通过显式的感官提示来激活这些潜在结构。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）来引导模型，使其在生成下一个token时，仿佛是基于潜在的视觉或听觉证据进行预测。

Result: 研究发现，轻量级的提示工程能够可靠地激活纯文本训练LLM中与模态相适应的表征。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLM内部表征隐含地受到语言中编码的多模态规律的影响，通过简单的感官提示可以有效地激活这些潜在结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: 该工作开创了将PCFGs作为研究语言模型学习动态的多功能测试平台，揭示了许多开放性问题，为理解神经网络如何表示层次语法提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many

### [42] [Hierarchical Semantic Retrieval with Cobweb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02539)
*Anant Gupta,Karthik Singaravadivelan,Zekun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cobweb框架通过构建层次化原型树实现文档检索，提供多粒度相关性信号和可解释的检索路径，在保持竞争力的同时提高了对嵌入质量的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经文档检索将语料库视为扁平向量云，忽略了语料结构且解释性差。本文旨在利用层次结构改进检索性能和可解释性。

Method: 使用Cobweb框架将句子嵌入组织成原型树，通过粗到细的遍历对文档进行排序。内部节点作为概念原型，提供多粒度相关性信号。实现了两种推理方法：广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上测试，使用编码器（BERT/T5）和解码器（GPT-2）表示。结果显示：在强编码器嵌入上匹配点积搜索性能；当kNN性能下降时仍保持鲁棒性；GPT-2向量上点积性能崩溃时，Cobweb仍能检索相关结果。

Conclusion: Cobweb提供了有竞争力的检索效果、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过层次化原型的可解释检索。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

### [43] [Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549)
*Sicheng Dong,Vahid Zolfaghari,Nenad Petrovic,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识图谱的RAG系统评估方法，扩展了RAGAS框架，通过多跳推理和语义社区聚类提供更全面的评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，RAG系统评估仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，结合多跳推理和语义社区聚类技术。

Result: 与RAGAS评分相比，该方法对生成输出的细微语义差异更敏感，且与人工标注结果相关性更高。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的评估方法能更深入地理解RAG系统性能，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了三种语音语言模型中的模态适配器如何转换语音表示，发现基于Whisper编码器的模型使用英语中介语表示语义，而其他模型则用英语单词表示语音音素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解语音语言模型中关键的模态适配器如何将语音编码器输出转换为语言模型可理解的表示，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 通过寻找模态适配器输出表示与解码器语言模型token的最近邻，分析三种语音语言模型（SALMONN、Qwen2-Audio和Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct）的表示策略。

Result: 发现两种不同的表示策略：使用Whisper编码器的模型通过英语中介语表示输入语义，能够处理指令调优中未见过的语言；不使用Whisper的模型则用英语单词表示输入音素。

Conclusion: 模态适配器的表示策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标——仅用于语音识别还是也用于翻译任务。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

### [45] [Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02629)
*Jingyi Sun,Pepa Atanasova,Sagnik Ray Choudhury,Sekh Mainul Islam,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个用于评估高亮解释方法在上下文归因任务中准确性的黄金标准框架，通过控制测试案例和已知真实上下文使用情况来评估四种高亮解释方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在利用上下文信息时缺乏透明度，用户无法确定模型是从参数记忆还是提供的上下文中获取信息，也无法识别哪些具体上下文片段影响了模型输出。高亮解释方法虽然能解决这个问题，但缺乏对其有效性的准确评估。

Method: 引入首个黄金标准高亮解释评估框架，使用已知真实上下文使用情况的控制测试案例。评估了四种高亮解释方法：三种现有技术和MechLight（一种为任务适配的机制可解释性方法），涵盖四个上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型。

Result: 在所有上下文场景中，MechLight表现最佳。但所有方法在处理较长上下文时都遇到困难，并表现出位置偏见，这表明在提供可靠的大规模上下文利用解释方面存在基本挑战。

Conclusion: 需要新的方法来提供可靠的大规模上下文利用解释，因为现有高亮解释方法在准确解释上下文归因方面存在局限性，特别是在处理长上下文时。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

### [46] [Mind the Gap: Linguistic Divergence and Adaptation Strategies in Human-LLM Assistant vs. Human-Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02645)
*Fulei Zhang,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 用户与LLM聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通风格存在显著差异，包括语法流畅度、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。为应对这种风格转变，数据增强策略比推理时消息重构更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在客户服务中的广泛应用，需要了解用户与聊天机器人vs人类客服的沟通差异，以便更好地训练模型适应实际部署后的沟通风格变化。

Method: 通过实证研究分析用户沟通风格差异，并测试两种增强策略：后训练阶段的数据增强和推理时用户消息重构。

Result: 用户在与聊天机器人互动时表现出不同的语法流畅度、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。数据增强策略显著优于仅使用原始或风格统一数据集的模型。

Conclusion: LLM需要适应部署后用户沟通风格的转变，数据增强是提高模型鲁棒性的有效方法，有助于改善LLM-用户交互体验。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

### [47] [SoT: Structured-of-Thought Prompting Guides Multilingual Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02648)
*Rui Qi,Zhibo Man,Yufeng Chen,Fengran Mo,Jinan Xu,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为结构化思维（SoT）的训练免费方法，通过多步转换提升多语言推理性能，将语言特定的语义信息转换为语言无关的结构化表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其推理能力未能成功迁移到非高资源语言，由于资源限制而在多语言推理任务中表现不佳。

Method: SoT方法通过语言思维转换和结构化知识转换两个步骤，将语言特定的语义信息转换为语言无关的结构化表示，引导LLMs进行更集中的推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，SoT在多个多语言推理基准测试中优于多个强基线模型，并能与其它训练免费策略集成以获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: SoT是一种有效的训练免费方法，能够显著提升LLMs在多语言推理任务中的性能，通过结构化表示解决跨语言表达变化带来的推理一致性问题。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Cherry-qwq/SoT.

Method: 从三个角度分析自改进方法：数据收集、数据组织和模型优化，并总结了常用评估方法和下游应用。

Result: 提供了多模态大语言模型自改进领域的首个结构化综述，为后续研究提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data
collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the
further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于上下文问答任务的不确定性量化方法，通过理论推导分离认知不确定性，并基于语义特征差距构建鲁棒的不确定性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前不确定性量化研究主要关注闭卷事实问答，而现实应用中更重要的上下文问答任务尚未被探索。

Method: 提出任务无关的token级不确定性度量，通过分解隔离认知不确定性，用理想模型近似真实分布，并基于上下文依赖、上下文理解和诚实性三个特征构建不确定性评分。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，该方法在分布内和分布外设置下均显著优于现有最先进的无监督和监督UQ方法，PRR提升高达13个百分点，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法为上下文问答任务提供了理论基础扎实的不确定性量化框架，通过语义特征差距有效捕捉认知不确定性，在性能和效率方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

### [50] [Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02712)
*Yubo Li,Ramayya Krishnan,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次对9个最先进大语言模型进行生存分析，发现突发语义漂移会急剧增加对话失败风险，而渐进累积漂移则显著降低失败风险并延长对话时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中随时间推移的退化动态，需要新的方法来理解多轮对话的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，包括Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，分析了36,951个对话轮次，将失败建模为时间到事件的过程。

Result: 加速失效时间模型表现最佳，具有优异的区分度和校准度。突发语义漂移会灾难性地增加对话失败风险，而渐进累积漂移则具有高度保护作用。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的强大范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供了具体见解，并挑战了对话AI系统中语义一致性的必要性假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

*Srinivas Billa,Xiaonan Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有LLM基准测试对低资源任务中的模型能力捕捉不足，作者构建了14个旅游领域数据集，发现通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现，推理能力对较小模型提升更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试在低资源任务中难以有效评估模型能力，无法为这些领域开发有效解决方案。

Method: 使用真实场景匿名数据构建了14个旅游领域数据集，涵盖7个常见NLP任务，分析不同LLM的性能表现。

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现；尽管训练FLOPs很大，现成LLM在复杂领域特定场景中仍遇到性能瓶颈；推理能力对较小模型提升更显著。

Conclusion: 需要专门的低资源任务基准测试来评估LLM能力，推理能力是提升较小模型性能的重要途径。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PGMEL方法，使用生成对抗网络框架解决多模态实体链接问题，通过生成器产生高质量负样本，判别器进行度量学习，提升实体链接性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未充分探索高质量负样本选择在度量学习中的关键作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用生成对抗网络框架，生成器负责生成高质量负样本（使用策略梯度优化），判别器负责度量学习任务。

Result: 在Wiki-MEL、Richpedia-MEL和WikiDiverse数据集上的实验表明，PGMEL通过选择具有挑战性的负样本学习有意义的表示，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PGMEL方法有效解决了多模态实体链接中负样本选择问题，证明了生成对抗框架在该任务中的有效性。

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Santhosh G S,Akshay Govind S,Gokul S Krishnan,Balaraman Ravindran,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于对比学习编码器的评估框架，用于检测LLMs在印度文化背景下的细微偏见，并创建了包含2,575个句子的IndiCASA数据集来评估种姓、性别、宗教、残疾和社会经济地位五个维度的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域的广泛应用需要对其嵌入的偏见进行严格评估，特别是在印度这样文化多元的背景下，现有基于嵌入的偏见评估方法往往无法捕捉细微的刻板印象。

Method: 使用对比学习训练的编码器通过嵌入相似性来捕捉细粒度偏见，并构建了IndiCASA数据集，包含五个社会人口维度的人类验证句子。

Result: 对多个开源LLMs的评估显示所有模型都表现出不同程度的刻板印象偏见，其中残疾相关偏见尤为持久，宗教偏见相对较低，这可能归因于全球去偏见努力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要开发更公平的模型，特别是在处理文化特定偏见方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我意识的强化学习方法，通过让LLM交替生成任务并尝试解决，仅需少量额外数据就能显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练需要大量标注数据，成本高昂。本文旨在探索如何用最少数据通过RL提升LLM推理能力。

Method: 引入两种自我意识机制：自我难度预测（评估任务难度并优先选择有挑战性但可解决的任务）和自我极限突破（识别能力边界并主动请求外部数据）。

Result: 在9个基准测试中实现了53.8%的相对提升，仅需不到1.2%的额外数据。

Conclusion: 自我意识RL方法有效，展示了自我进化智能体训练的前景。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

TL;DR: 提出了XTRA框架，通过表示对齐和主题对齐的双重机制，在跨语言主题建模中实现更好的主题一致性、多样性和对齐质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言主题建模方法在主题多样性方面有所改进，但难以确保高主题一致性和跨语言一致性对齐

Method: XTRA框架结合词袋模型和多语言嵌入，包含表示对齐（通过对比学习对齐文档-主题分布）和主题对齐（将主题-词分布投影到共享语义空间）两个核心组件

Result: 在多语言语料库上的实验表明，XTRA在主题一致性、多样性和对齐质量方面显著优于强基线方法

Conclusion: XTRA能够学习到可解释（一致且多样）且在跨语言间良好对齐的主题

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG框架通过结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流，在多跳问答中实现了最先进的性能，提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成在多跳问答中面临迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索整合的挑战，需要更有效的方法来构建明确的证据链。

Method: 首先构建全局索引，推理时仅将检索到的段落实时解析为知识图谱，将复杂查询分解为子问题，对每个子问题使用BFS遍历动态扩展相关边，组装明确的证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA数据集上达到最先进的精确匹配和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，在HotpotQA上获得最大增益（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: StepChain GraphRAG通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作应解决计算开销和大型语言模型可能产生的幻觉问题，以提升多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

TL;DR: 该研究系统验证了5个领先大语言模型在21,955个物种上的表现，发现模型在分类学上表现优异(94.9%)，但在保护推理方面表现很差(27.2%)，揭示了知识-推理差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在物种保护评估中的可靠性，因为LLMs正被快速应用于保护生物学以应对生物多样性危机。

Method: 对5个领先LLM在21,955个物种上进行系统验证，涵盖IUCN红色名录评估的四个核心组成部分：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 模型在分类学分类上表现出色(94.9%)，但在保护状态评估等推理任务上表现很差(27.2%)，存在系统性偏见，偏向有魅力的脊椎动物。

Conclusion: LLMs是强大的信息检索工具，但需要人类监督进行基于判断的决策，建议采用混合方法，LLMs增强专家能力，但人类专家保留风险评估和政策的最终决定权。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个完整的Wordle CSP公式化方法，引入约束感知的熵计算和概率CSP框架，在英语词汇上实现3.54次平均猜测和99.9%成功率，比现有方法提升1.7%且运行速度快46%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理，需要开发基于约束满足问题(CSP)的正式求解策略。

Method: 引入CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益而非原始候选集）和概率CSP框架（将贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束集成），并开发约束恢复机制。

Result: 在2,315个英语单词上，CSP感知熵达到3.54次平均猜测和99.9%成功率；在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点优势；概率CSP在所有噪声水平(0-20%)下实现100%成功率；在500个西班牙语单词上验证了88%成功率且无需语言特定调整。

Conclusion: 正式的CSP处理、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证确立了新的性能基准，证明基于约束满足的技术在结构化谜题求解领域优于经典信息论和学习方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

*Jian Mu,Qixin Zhang,Zhiyong Wang,Menglin Yang,Shuang Qiu,Chengwei Qin,Zhongxiang Dai,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRGen是一个轻量级的测试时框架，通过动态熵阈值识别不确定token，并训练特定纠正向量来修正token概率分布，从而在生成过程中实现自我反思，提高LLM推理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂推理任务中采用长链思维，但前向自回归生成过程脆弱，早期token错误会级联传播，需要自我反思机制。现有方法要么对完整草稿进行修订，要么通过昂贵训练学习自我纠正，都是被动且低效的。

Method: 提出SRGen框架：在token生成时使用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token；为每个识别出的token训练特定纠正向量；利用已生成上下文进行自我反思生成，修正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试和多种LLM上评估，SRGen能持续增强模型推理能力：单次生成质量提升也转化为更强的自一致性投票。在AIME2024上，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B的Pass@1提升12.0%，Cons@5提升13.3%。

Conclusion: SRGen是一个即插即用方法，将反思集成到生成过程中，实现可靠的LLM推理，以有限开销获得一致增益，并能与其他训练时和测试时技术广泛组合。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

Motivation: 填补对话数据检索评估标准的空白，为产品洞察提供可靠的对话数据检索性能衡量标准。

Method: 构建包含1.6k查询和9.1k对话的基准数据集，评估16个流行嵌入模型，分析对话数据检索的独特挑战。

Result: 最佳模型NDCG@10仅为0.51，显著低于文档检索性能，识别出隐含状态识别、对话轮次动态、上下文引用等独特挑战。

Conclusion: 对话数据检索面临独特挑战，现有模型性能有限，需要专门的方法来改进对话数据检索能力。

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first
comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data
for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k
conversations, our benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring
conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular
embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of
0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data
retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational
data retrieval (implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, contextual
references) while providing practical query templates and detailed error
analysis across different task categories. The benchmark dataset and code are

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于检测LLM微调中是否使用受版权保护数据集的实用框架，通过无失真水印和熵门控检测方法实现黑盒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击和数据集推理方法需要访问内部信号或依赖手工提示，实用性有限。水印技术虽然可行，但会降低文本质量或任务性能。

Method: TRACE使用私钥指导的无失真水印重写数据集，在检测时利用微调对水印数据的放射性效应，引入熵门控程序选择性评分高不确定性token。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型家族中，TRACE始终实现显著检测效果(p<0.05)，通常具有极强的统计证据，支持多数据集归属且对后续预训练保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: TRACE为可靠的黑盒验证受版权保护数据集使用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于查询英国NICE临床指南，该系统通过混合嵌入机制实现高精度检索，显著提高了回答的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICE临床指南篇幅冗长、数量庞大，在时间紧迫的医疗系统中难以有效利用，需要一种能够快速提供精确匹配信息的解决方案。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，结合混合嵌入机制，从10,195个文本块中检索相关信息，使用大型语言模型生成答案。

Result: 系统在7,901个查询上表现出色：平均倒数排名0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%。RAG增强模型在忠实度方面提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，显著优于医学专用模型Meditron3-8B的43%。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗保健领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够实现医疗指南的经济高效访问。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Motivation: 语音情感识别对于改善人机交互至关重要，但目前其准确性受到语音中情感细微差异复杂性的限制。

Method: 通过让参与者观看情感丰富的电影片段后描述体验，记录音频片段、意图情感标签、自评情感反应和效价/唤醒度评分。

Result: 实验表明描述性语义与意图情感一致，表达性语义与诱发情感相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为语音情感识别在人机交互中的应用提供了见解，并为开发更上下文感知的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: 比较语音到文本翻译中Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和直接提示策略在不同数据规模下的表现，发现随着S2TT数据增加，直接提示策略表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前S2TT研究主要关注基于LLM的模型和CoT提示策略，但需要系统比较CoT和直接提示在不同数据规模下的效果差异。

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录本伪标记翻译成六种欧洲语言，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，比较两种提示策略。

Result: 随着数据量增加，直接提示策略表现出更一致的改进，表明在更大S2TT资源可用时，直接提示可能成为更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 当S2TT数据资源充足时，直接提示策略可能优于CoT提示，这为未来S2TT系统设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有LLMs在专业领域应用存在挑战。需要开发能够准确比较报告语义差异的方法来帮助初级医生改进报告质量。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1大型语言模型和命名实体识别(NER)，通过可调权重来强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成量化相似度评分和解释性反馈。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1分范围内准确率，优于单独使用LLMs或NER方法。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore方法在放射学报告比较中表现出色，为初级放射科医生提供了有价值的训练工具，能够有效识别报告差异并提供解释性反馈。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Motivation: 解决语音到文本翻译系统中错误传播和无法利用韵律等声学线索的问题，探索CoT提示是否能真正联合利用语音和转录信息。

Method: 通过归因方法分析CoT、使用损坏转录进行鲁棒性评估、以及韵律感知分析，并测试添加直接S2TT数据或噪声转录注入等训练干预措施。

Result: CoT很大程度上模仿级联系统行为，主要依赖转录文本，很少利用语音信息。简单训练干预能增强鲁棒性并提高语音归因。

Conclusion: CoT的假设优势受到挑战，需要明确将声学信息整合到翻译中的架构。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

Motivation: 现有的自动生成学术综述方法（LLM4Survey）输出质量达不到人类标准，且缺乏与读者需求对齐的严格评估基准。

Method: 构建SurveyBench框架，包含：从11,343篇arXiv论文和4,947篇高质量综述中提取典型主题；多维度指标层次评估大纲质量、内容质量和非文本丰富度；基于内容和测验的双模式评估协议。

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类低21%。

Conclusion: SurveyBench填补了LLM4Survey评估的空白，为自动生成学术综述提供了严格的读者对齐评估标准。

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

### [70] [EditLens: Quantifying the Extent of AI Editing in Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03154)
*Katherine Thai,Bradley Emi,Elyas Masrour,Mohit Iyyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出EditLens模型，能够检测AI编辑文本并量化编辑程度，在区分人类写作、AI生成和混合写作任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，但大量查询实际上是要求AI编辑用户提供的文本，因此需要研究如何检测AI编辑的文本。

Method: 首先使用轻量级相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，然后以这些指标为中间监督训练EditLens回归模型来预测文本中的AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类任务中F1=94.7%，在三元分类任务中F1=90.4%，并成功分析了Grammarly等写作辅助工具的编辑效果。

Conclusion: AI编辑文本是可检测的，且AI对人类写作的修改程度也可检测，这对作者归属、教育和政策有重要意义。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

TL;DR: 该研究验证了先前关于大语言模型隐藏状态与fMRI大脑响应相关性的发现，证明这些相关性对维度诅咒具有鲁棒性，且特定于经过人类语言训练的模型，并依赖于位置编码的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试先前关于大语言模型隐藏状态与fMRI大脑响应相关性的研究结果是否对几个可能的担忧具有鲁棒性，包括维度诅咒、相似性度量方法、模型训练数据和位置编码的影响。

Method: 通过维度降低、使用新的相似性度量方法、比较不同训练数据的模型以及分析位置编码的影响，来验证先前研究结果的稳健性。

Result: 研究发现：(i) 维度降低后先前结果仍然存在；(ii) 使用新的相似性度量方法确认了先前结果；(iii) 相关性特定于经过人类语言训练的模型；(iv) 结果依赖于模型中位置编码的存在。

Conclusion: 这些结果证实并加强了先前研究的发现，为大语言模型的生物合理性和可解释性辩论做出了贡献。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在大型语言模型时代下主题建模的新范式，验证"大多数神经主题模型已过时"的说法，比较LLM与传统NTMs在主题质量上的表现。

Method: 将主题建模定义为长文本生成任务，提出基于零样本提示的简单实用方法：采样数据子集、通过提示生成主题和代表性文本、关键词匹配进行文本分配。

Result: 通过系统性比较LLM与NTMs在主题质量上的表现，实证检验了LLM在主题建模任务中的能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于长文本生成范式的LLM主题建模方法能够与传统神经主题模型竞争，为新时代的主题建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

TL;DR: NN-Rank是一种基于多语言模型隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据的源语言排序算法，在词性标注和命名实体识别任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨语言迁移方法需要依赖词汇和语言特征，而NN-Rank旨在利用多语言模型的表示能力来更准确地选择源语言。

Method: 利用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据，通过计算语言间的相似度来对源语言进行排序。

Result: 在词性标注任务上平均提升35.56 NDCG，命名实体识别任务上提升18.14 NDCG，即使使用少量数据也能获得高质量排序结果。

Conclusion: NN-Rank提供了一种有效的源语言选择方法，特别适用于资源匮乏的语言，且对数据量的要求较低。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

TL;DR: FocusAgent使用轻量级LLM检索器从网页可访问性树中提取最相关的内容行，通过剪枝减少观察大小50%以上，同时保持任务性能并显著降低提示注入攻击风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页代理处理冗长网页内容时面临上下文限制饱和、计算成本高和提示注入安全风险的问题，现有剪枝策略要么丢弃相关内容要么保留无关上下文，导致次优动作预测。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM检索器从可访问性树观察中提取与任务目标最相关的行，通过剪枝噪声和无关内容实现高效推理。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent与强基线性能相当，同时将观察大小减少50%以上；其变体显著降低了横幅和弹窗等提示注入攻击的成功率，在无攻击环境下保持任务成功率。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的有针对性检索是构建高效、有效且安全的网页代理的实用且鲁棒策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

*Tianyu Fu,Zihan Min,Hanling Zhang,Jichao Yan,Guohao Dai,Wanli Ouyang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Cache-to-Cache（C2C）新范式，通过直接语义通信在多LLM系统中实现性能提升和延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富的语义信息并产生逐token生成的延迟，需要探索超越文本的通信方式。

Method: 使用神经网络投影和融合源模型与目标模型的KV-cache，实现直接语义传输，并通过可学习门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层。

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式性能提升约3.0-5.0%，同时平均延迟降低2.0倍。

Conclusion: KV-cache可作为LLM间通信的有效媒介，C2C通过直接语义通信充分利用模型深度专业化语义，避免中间文本生成，实现性能与效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Anchor是一种新颖的提示方法，通过将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划并自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，解决LLM在长推理链中注意力分散的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链延长，关键中间步骤和原始提示会被上下文淹没，导致注意力不足和错误。需要一种轻量级方法来引导LLM在复杂推理任务中的注意力。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在生成过程中保持专注。

Result: 在六个基准测试中优于最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了"非推理"模型与专用推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练即可处理复杂推理任务，为提示方法提供了有效的注意力引导机制。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现奖励模型和评估指标两个研究领域相互分离，导致术语冗余和问题重复，希望通过领域合作来克服这些共同挑战。

Method: 通过比较指标与奖励模型在特定任务上的表现，并对两个领域进行广泛调研，指出需要更紧密合作的研究方向。

Result: 研究发现评估指标在特定任务上优于奖励模型，并识别出多个可以通过领域合作改进的研究主题。

Conclusion: 建议奖励模型和评估指标领域建立更紧密的合作关系，在偏好获取方法、避免虚假相关性和奖励攻击、基于校准的元评估等方面实现共同进步。

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GAN和SMOTE等数据增强技术，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步极值预测，发现SMOTE策略在适应性和性能方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。本研究旨在通过数据增强技术解决极值预测中的类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用GAN和SMOTE等数据增强技术，结合Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步极值预测，并提出了基于相关性函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在适应性和性能方面表现最佳，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据集中表现优异，BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强技术能有效提升极值预测性能，SMOTE策略具有最佳适应性，不同深度学习模型在不同类型数据中各有优势。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，实现了对任意长度多时间序列的推理。包含两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLMs无法处理时间序列数据的局限性，特别是在医疗领域，将大量临床信息转化为可操作的洞察和数字健康应用。

Method: 提出两种架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接进行隐式建模；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力机制显式集成时间序列与文本。

Result: 在HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT和ECG-QA-CoT三个数据集上，OpenTSLM模型均优于基线方法，在睡眠分期任务达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务达到65.4 F1，显著优于仅文本微调模型（9.05和52.2）。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超越了GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，在医疗时间序列推理任务中表现出色，特别是Flamingo架构在长序列处理上具有内存效率优势。所有代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达数据与地面降雨观测之间的空间对齐和物理转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的精度和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局域极端值，影响了洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析的准确性。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局域地面降雨，地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降、融化和蒸发过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低了13.31%以上，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，成功解决了降雨场重建中的关键挑战，为高精度降雨监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，只能通过静态提示进行定制，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境的动态变化。

Method: 训练轻量级参数化策略模型，使用强化学习在上下文中反应式地发出自然语言指导指令，基于环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在多个推理和个性化领域，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提升下游任务性能，且具有跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的参数化接口，是实现个性化和环境自适应AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的多信号数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合不确定性、稀有性、多样性等异构信号，使用单一流动性参数控制选择集中度，在固定计算预算下实现高效数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据选择方法需要手动设置异构信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等）的权重，缺乏系统性和透明度。需要一种统一框架来自动整合多信号，实现高效数据选择。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个数据样本定价，信号作为交易者参与市场，通过单一流动性参数控制选择集中度。引入价格每token规则处理token预算，轻量级多样性头提高覆盖范围。

Result: 在GSM8K（60k token预算）上，市场方法在保持性能的同时减少种子方差，选择开销小于0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews（保留5-25%数据）上实现竞争性准确率，同时提升平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为多信号数据筛选提供了统一方法，在固定计算预算下适用于提示级推理和分类任务，实现了透明可控的数据选择过程。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at

*Logan Frank,Paul Ardis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了后训练量化(PTQ)在安全关键环境中可能导致的极端性能下降问题，通过知识蒸馏和强化学习分析了量化下的最坏情况性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PTQ能有效降低神经网络的计算复杂度和内存使用，但在安全关键部署环境中，量化可能导致严重的性能下降，需要研究这种极端故障的情况和输入分布特征。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和位宽策略对，分析量化下的灾难性故障，重点关注最坏情况下的性能潜力。

Result: 发现了确实存在"有害"的网络-策略对，多个实例显示准确率下降10-65%，而"稳健"对应物仅下降<2%。通过系统实验和分析，初步探索了最高脆弱点。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在现实世界部署中需要谨慎，鼓励对鲁棒性进行更严格的检查，并在深度学习领域更重视安全考虑。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

TL;DR: SAGE是一种流式数据子集选择方法，通过维护梯度几何的紧凑Frequent Directions草图，在O(ℓD)内存中优先选择与共识方向对齐的示例，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练现代神经网络在大型数据集上计算和能耗密集，需要减少训练成本的方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图维护梯度几何，通过两遍、GPU友好的流水线消除N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储，基于一致性评分选择数据子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用小的保持率预算进行训练，同时相对于全数据训练和最新子集选择基线保持竞争性准确率，减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，补充了剪枝和模型压缩，用于高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，用于优化生物分子功效预测的集成学习。研究表明，TabPFN模型的预测不确定性（IQR）与真实预测误差呈负相关，通过选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成，可以获得优于传统集成方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子功效预测中表现出色，但其性能高度依赖于提供的上下文。在没有真实标签的情况下，如何选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 研究采用基于不确定性的模型选择策略，使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过模型预测的IQR（分位数间范围）作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成。

Result: 在siRNA敲低功效任务中，TabPFN模型超越了专门的最先进预测器。模型的不确定性（IQR）与真实预测误差呈负相关，通过选择平均不确定性最低的模型集成，性能优于朴素集成或使用所有数据训练的单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是优化生物分子功效预测的强大、无需标签的启发式方法，为生物信息学中的模型选择提供了有效策略。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

TL;DR: Litespark是一个新颖的预训练框架，通过优化transformer的注意力机制和MLP层，显著提升训练效率，在3B和30B参数Llama模型上实现2-6倍训练吞吐量提升和55%-83%能耗降低。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练面临训练时间长和能耗巨大的挑战，现代模型需要数月计算时间和吉瓦时级别的电力消耗。

Method: 结合架构改进和算法优化，针对transformer注意力层和MLP层进行针对性优化，最大化模型FLOPs利用率，同时保持与标准transformer实现的兼容性。

Result: 在3B和30B参数Llama模型上使用SlimPajama-627B数据集进行基准测试，显示训练吞吐量提升2-6倍，能耗降低55%-83%。

Conclusion: 这些优化与模型和硬件无关，可广泛应用于transformer架构，并扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACF的对比学习方法，用于从高维观测中发现独立可控的潜在变量，解决了现有方法无法同时处理高维输入和利用因子化结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因子化MDP方法假设因子化表示已知，而深度强化学习能处理高维观测但无法利用因子化结构。需要一种方法能同时处理高维输入并发现可控因子。

Method: 使用对比学习方法ACF，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作通常只影响状态变量的子集）来发现独立可控的潜在变量。

Result: 在三个已知因子化结构的基准测试（Taxi、FourRooms、MiniGrid-DoorKey）中，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实的可控因子，并持续优于基线解耦算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了表示学习问题，能够从高维观测中发现独立可控的潜在变量，为强化学习中的因子化结构利用提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL能够从大数据集中学习以快速控制多参数系统，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会急剧下降；而ES能够处理时变系统和未知控制方向，但收敛速度随参数数量增加而减慢且容易陷入局部最小值。

Method: 将DRL和ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速学习控制多参数系统到期望设定点，而ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在数值研究和粒子加速器自动调谐应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: DRL和ES的结合能够互补各自的缺点，产生优于单独使用任一方法的控制性能，特别适用于具有时变特性的复杂系统控制。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的基本等价性，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习了一个隐式的密集token级奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中提取密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上将SFT视为简单的模仿学习过程，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 通过建立SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出基线相对奖励函数从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发了Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: 本文重新定义了SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，从而在有限状态设备上实现片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但有效的内存内训练通常需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。实际中许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制仅提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习以补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析表明最优性差距随瓦片数量减少并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存内训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻器件的训练精度问题，为片上训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地流，并沿着这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，同时比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升了可扩展性和训练效率。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Method: 使用IATC作为最严格的跨被试映射函数集，双向映射模型响应与大脑数据，评估模型能否像典型被试一样被映射。在模拟神经网络、小鼠和人类被试群体中识别IATC。

Conclusion: IATC证明模型预测性与机制识别之间不存在固有权衡，为地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated

prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs

Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters

Conclusion: 高阶导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN在表达能力上与WL层次结构对齐，并与子图GNNs和结构编码方案有深层联系。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,
showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established

Motivation: 解决AdaLoRA在训练过程中收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题，同时保持动态秩分配的优势。

Method: 使用基于注意力机制的超网络动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，通过剪裁超网络输出的奇异值实现动态秩分配，避免直接优化SVD组件。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度，且不牺牲性能。对其他基于LoRA的方法的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效加速了AdaLoRA的收敛，提供了一种高效且通用的参数高效微调解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Result: 结果显示，相对于桥梁第一固有频率的频率比在0.3到0.7之间的车辆最有效，而接近共振的车辆性能较差。较轻的车辆需要较低的固有频率以实现最优检测。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格优化基于车辆传感平台的研究，并提出了专门设计的巡检车辆。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要开发能够真正理解学生需求、提供个性化指导且准确的AI辅导模型。现有模型在辅导的核心技能方面存在不足。

Method: 构建了TutorBench数据集，包含1,490个高中和AP课程样本，涵盖三个辅导任务。采用基于样本特定评分标准的LLM-judge自动评估方法，对16个前沿LLMs进行评估。

Result: 所有前沿LLMs的得分均不超过56%，在辅导技能相关标准上的通过率低于60%。不同模型家族表现各异：Claude模型在促进主动学习方面领先，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在展现完整的辅导技能方面仍有不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI辅导系统提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

Motivation: 研究深度学习训练过程中神经元分布的拓扑结构变化，揭示学习率对拓扑约束的影响，理解神经网络学习动力学的两个阶段。

Method: 通过数学证明分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的双Lipschitz映射性质，建立学习率与拓扑约束的定量关系。

Result: 发现学习率临界点η*的存在，将学习动力学分为两个阶段：第一阶段在拓扑约束下平滑优化，第二阶段通过拓扑简化进行学习。该理论独立于具体架构和损失函数。

Conclusion: 拓扑方法可普遍应用于深度学习研究，揭示了神经网络训练中拓扑结构演化的普适规律，为理解学习动力学提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Conclusion: GRAFT框架为扩散模型提供了一种有效的分布整形方法，通过中间噪声级别的分布整形和逆噪声校正，在多个生成任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要既能提供高回报又避免灾难性尾部风险。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: 提出风险感知多模态actor-critic框架，结合表达性生成actor和分布critic，通过生成路径区分复合目标（分布风险和BC损失）。

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务中，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线RL中风险敏感学习与策略表达性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern
industries by enabling smart automation and real time connectivity. However,
this evolution has also introduced complex cybersecurity challenges due to the
heterogeneous, resource constrained, and distributed nature of these
environments. To address these challenges, this research presents CST AFNet, a
novel dual attention based deep learning framework specifically designed for
robust intrusion detection in IoT networks. The model integrates multi scale
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal
dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention,
to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex
IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and
adaptive cyber physical systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知来解决现有方法在节点和边级别嵌入增强以及对比样本对处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强之间的交互作用。同时，它们通常平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了困难与简单正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Method: 提出RAGC方法，包含混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知两个模块。HCA同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；CSADA利用高置信度伪标签信息自适应识别所有对比样本对，并通过创新的权重调制函数差异化处理它们。两个模块在良性循环中相互促进。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法在多个最先进的CAGC方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知策略，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个创新的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理，显著提升了流式文本生成的性能，在保持高吞吐量的同时大幅降低了首token延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM服务系统存在非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理的局限性，导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发时表现不佳。

Method: 采用动态优先级调度（基于实时token缓冲区占用率和消费率），主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，并通过I/O与计算重叠来最小化抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型上，TokenFlow实现了82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，P99 TTFT降低80.2%，且不降低整体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理机制，显著改善了LLM流式服务的响应性和稳定性，为实时交互应用提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic

Motivation: 探索生物神经网络是否使用与人工神经网络不同的学习策略，特别是研究非梯度学习动态在优化过程中的作用。

Method: 在前馈网络中使用学生-教师框架进行理论分析，通过规则翻转的可塑性神经元系统性地引入非梯度动态。

Result: 小旋度项保持原始解流形的稳定性，学习动态类似于梯度下降；超过临界值后，强旋度项会破坏解流形稳定性，可能导致混沌学习动态或意外加速学习。

Conclusion: 特定网络架构能够通过多样化的学习规则支持稳健学习，这对基于梯度的学习规范性理论提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Motivation: 现有研究要么只能获得次优的O(1/√n)泛化速率，要么只适用于平滑激活函数且泛化误差指数级依赖网络深度。本文旨在为深度ReLU网络建立最优的泛化速率。

Method: 通过精心平衡优化误差和泛化误差，在数据满足NTK可分性假设下，推导出深度ReLU网络梯度下降的泛化误差界。关键技术贡献是提出了对参考模型附近激活模式的新颖控制方法。

Result: 证明了在数据NTK可分性假设下，梯度下降的泛化误差为Õ(L⁴(1+γL²)/(nγ²))，这与最优SVM型速率Õ(1/(nγ²))仅相差深度相关因子。

Conclusion: 深度ReLU网络在梯度下降训练下可以实现接近最优的泛化性能，且泛化误差仅多项式依赖网络深度，而非指数依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过使用更广泛的函数类别来量化预测区间的相关性，而不是简单的二元评估，从而产生更窄的预测区间同时保持覆盖有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线共形预测方法在阈值更新步骤中只关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进方法。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用更广泛的函数类别替换二元评估（内部/外部），这些函数使用真实值来量化预测区间的相关性，从而防止阈值突变并可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的函数来增强阈值更新步骤，能够有效改善在线共形预测的性能，产生更窄的预测区间而不牺牲覆盖有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能耗的主要来源，但现有研究仅提供粗粒度的模型级指标，缺乏细粒度测量方法，无法将能效作为主要优化目标。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法（Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling），通过重复采样解决微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗传感器监测之间的时间不匹配问题。

Result: 评估了15个涵盖四种架构类型的模型，组件级能耗方差始终低于9.5%，捕获了模型总能耗的90%以上。注意力块每FLOP能耗显著更高，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能transformer模型提供了初步见解，证明FLOPs无法准确捕捉组件级真实能耗成本。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了层次化Group DRO方法，解决传统方法对组内分布偏移的脆弱性问题，在模拟的少数群体分布偏移基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移鲁棒，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了层次化Group DRO扩展，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，为多层次的分布偏移提供鲁棒性。

Result: 在新设计的模拟少数群体分布偏移基准上，该方法表现出强大的鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒学习方法在这些条件下持续失败。在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性非常重要。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用模板，将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，同时保持其遗憾保证，并应用于延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等同于随机i.i.d.输入，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。

Method: 提出了一个通用模板来适配随机学习算法到随机顺序模型，而不显著影响其遗憾保证。

Result: 恢复了延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机问题的改进遗憾界，并证明在随机顺序下可学习性由VC维而非Littlestone维表征。

Conclusion: 该模板成功将随机算法适配到随机顺序模型，提供了与一般对抗模型的进一步分离。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexiQ是一种自适应混合精度量化方案，通过选择性对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，实时调整低比特通道比例来管理波动的工作负载，在保持精度的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络通常在NPU和GPU等硬件加速器上运行，但这些加速器成本高昂且难以根据实时工作负载波动灵活扩展资源。

Method: FlexiQ选择性对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，采用高效的比特降低方法最小化量化误差，并实时调整低比特通道比例以适应工作负载变化。

Result: 在11个卷积和基于transformer的视觉模型上评估，FlexiQ在4位模型上平均精度提高6.6%，优于四种最先进的量化技术。50% 4位模型仅损失0.6%精度，达到100% 4位模型相对于8位模型40%的加速效果。

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理波动的推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

*Makram Chahine,Philipp Nazari,Daniela Rus,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出在训练过程中使用Hankel奇异值分析来动态缩减状态空间模型(SSMs)的维度，通过保留高影响力维度来平衡计算效率和表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时面临计算负担与表达能力之间的平衡挑战，需要找到既能保持模型表现力又能限制计算成本的方法。

Method: 利用控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别并保留高影响力的状态维度，对原始系统进行平衡截断，实现动态维度缩减。

Result: 实验表明，在训练过程中进行缩减显著加速了优化过程，同时保持了表达能力，压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩减维度的SSMs能够在保持计算效率的同时获得更高的性能表现。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

*Steve Hong,Samuel Belkadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出将视觉自回归模型重新解释为迭代精炼框架，通过前向过程构建拉普拉斯式潜在金字塔，后向过程以粗到细的方式重建，连接了VAR与去噪扩散模型，并分析了三个关键设计选择对效率和保真度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视视觉自回归模型，将其形式化为迭代精炼框架，以更好地理解其高效性和保真度的来源，并建立与扩散模型的联系。

Method: 将VAR建模为确定性前向过程构建潜在金字塔和学习的后向重建过程，通过控制实验量化三个关键因素：学习潜在空间中的精炼、离散分类预测、空间频率任务划分。

Result: 框架解释了VAR的效率和保真度，展示了如何扩展到图生成和天气预报任务，并提供了与扩散生态系统工具集成的实用接口。

Conclusion: 迭代精炼框架为理解VAR提供了新视角，揭示了其高效性的关键因素，并展示了在保持少步、尺度并行生成的同时与扩散工具集成的可行性。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

*Dohyun Bu,Jisoo Han,Soohwa Kwon,Yulim So,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SASL框架，一种可解释的个性化健康预测方法，结合稀疏线性模型和LightGBM，在保持可解释性的同时达到与黑盒模型相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习和梯度提升模型在预测个性化健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异。

Method: 使用普通最小二乘回归与主体特定交互，通过迭代后向特征消除构建稀疏模型，并采用回归-阈值方法优化序数目标的F1分数，通过置信度门控选择性集成LightGBM。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集上，SASL-LightGBM混合框架与复杂黑盒方法性能相当，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了与黑盒模型相当的预测性能，为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Karma是一个知识感知的频率自适应学习模型，用于电池容量估计和剩余寿命预测，通过双流深度学习架构结合信号分解和知识引导，在电池健康预测上显著优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型虽然能捕捉时间退化特征，但缺乏知识引导，导致长期健康预测不可靠。电池退化行为复杂，包含非线性、噪声、容量再生等现象，需要更准确和鲁棒的预测方法。

Method: 首先进行信号分解得到不同频段的电池信号；开发双流深度学习架构，一个流捕捉长期低频退化趋势，另一个流建模高频短期动态；使用基于经验研究的双指数函数建模电池退化知识；通过粒子滤波器优化知识参数，确保物理一致性和可靠性。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma相比最先进算法分别实现了50.6%和32.6%的平均误差降低，表现出优越的性能、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Karma模型通过结合知识引导和频率自适应学习，为各种应用提供了更安全可靠的电池管理解决方案，在电池健康预测方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级的离线强化学习方法，通过优化加权对数似然目标来替代需要大量在线计算的TTRL方法，在推理任务上表现更优且训练速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励信号，而TTRL方法虽然使用多数投票奖励但计算成本高昂，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出RoiRL方法，采用离线迭代强化学习，优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，显著降低内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现一致优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无需标签的自改进大语言模型提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，通过预测性水印、双向水印及其组合策略，解决了传统水印方法在非自回归模型上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效，需要专门的水印解决方案。

Method: 提出三种互补策略：预测性水印（使用模型预测的令牌）、双向水印（利用扩散解码的前后依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（组合两种方法）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法仅为49.6-71.2%，同时保持文本质量。

Conclusion: DMark证明了在非自回归语言模型上进行有效水印是可行的，并对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动力学模型依赖计算成本高的最优传输预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用，需要更高效和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 提出Cell-MNN编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是局部线性化的ODE，用于控制从干细胞到组织细胞的演化动力学，仅需标准PCA预处理即可端到端训练。

Result: Cell-MNN在单细胞基准测试中达到竞争性性能，在扩展到更大数据集和跨多个数据集联合训练方面超越现有基线，并学习到经过TRRUST数据库验证的可解释基因相互作用。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN为细胞分化动力学建模提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，能够学习生物学一致的基因相互作用。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下的性能下降和公平性问题，特别是针对表现不佳的客户端进行优化。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost(SAMME)算法的权重机制，为本地错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态调整焦点损失参数，强调难以分类的样本以提升表现不佳客户端的训练效果。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的评估表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto方法，在保持竞争力的同时显著提高了公平性。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架通过创新的聚合和提升机制，有效解决了联邦学习在非IID环境中的公平性和性能问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为临床变长时间序列分类提供了可靠且可解释的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Motivation: 现有的持续强化学习研究主要关注风险中性决策，即优化期望长期性能。本文旨在将风险感知决策引入持续强化学习，探索超越均值的长期性能优化。

Method: 首先分析经典风险度量理论与持续设置的不兼容性，然后引入新的遍历风险度量类别，最后通过案例研究和实证结果验证该方法的有效性。

Result: 研究表明经典风险度量理论在当前形式下与持续设置不兼容，而新提出的遍历风险度量在持续学习环境中具有直观吸引力和理论合理性。

Conclusion: 遍历风险度量为风险感知的持续强化学习提供了理论基础，解决了经典风险度量在持续设置中的局限性，为终身学习和持续适应开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法能有效利用高频数据提升低频午报数据的轴功率预测精度，在不同类型船舶上均表现出良好效果。

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Motivation: 传统IRL方法仅恢复确定性奖励估计或匹配期望回报，无法捕捉专家行为的丰富结构，特别是在学习奖励分布方面。

Method: 通过最小化一阶随机占优违规，将失真风险度量整合到策略学习中，从而恢复奖励分布和分布感知策略。

Result: 在合成基准测试、真实世界神经行为数据和MuJoCo控制任务上的实验结果表明，该方法恢复了表达性奖励表示并实现了最先进的模仿性能。

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够有效捕捉专家行为的复杂结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有条件扩散模型的训练依赖大规模数据集，但这些数据集中条件输入往往包含噪声、模糊或不完整的标签信息，导致条件不匹配和生成质量下降。

Method: 基于似然最大化推导出统一框架，将目标分解为生成组件（建模不精确标签分布）和分类组件（使用扩散分类器推断类后验概率），并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Result: 在多种形式的不精确监督任务（图像生成、弱监督学习、噪声数据集压缩）上的广泛实验表明，DMIS能持续生成高质量且类判别性强的样本。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督问题的框架，能有效处理各种形式的不精确条件输入，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号样本具有固有的反相关性，可以通过符号图中的负边很好地建模。为了使用收集的EEG信号区分癫痫患者和健康受试者，需要构建轻量级且可解释的神经网络模型。

Method: 构建平衡符号图（无奇数负边环的图），通过相似变换将图拉普拉斯矩阵映射到对应的正图，使用Lanczos近似在映射的正图上高效实现理想低通滤波器，从数据中学习最优截止频率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过平衡符号图的光谱去噪实现了高效的EEG信号分类，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了模型参数，具有良好的可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CHORD框架通过设备-云协作和混合精度量化，成功实现了无需重训练的个性化模型部署，显著降低了通信开销并提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Motivation: 当前机器学习势函数缺乏有效的不确定性量化能力，限制了其在主动学习、校准和分布外检测中的可靠性。

Method: 提出贝叶斯E(3)等变MLPs，采用迭代重分层多体消息传递，引入联合能量-力负对数似然损失函数，系统评估多种贝叶斯方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发不确定性感知的大规模原子模拟MLPs提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Conclusion: UD3RL框架有效解决了接近旅行商问题，通过分离决策任务实现了优越的性能和泛化能力，为处理复杂组合优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散和流式生成模型在蛋白质骨架生成任务中表现出色，但受限于反向扩散过程需要数百次迭代步骤，生成速度慢，限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 通过适当调整最先进的分数身份蒸馏(SiD)策略，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制技术，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际的蛋白质工程应用，实现了大规模计算机辅助蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Result: 实证结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性，以及对更具挑战性的图学习设置的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能在训练结束后返回特征重要性分数，还能监控特征是否被有效剔除，并可用此技术评估其他指标。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征来选择重要层进行重训练，在边缘设备上实现高效模型适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上利用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有方法依赖标记数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: 通过Betti数分析激活空间的拓扑特征来对重要层进行排名，仅使用前向传播，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上评估，AdaBet比基于梯度的基线方法平均分类准确率提高5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种无需梯度的层选择方法，能够在资源受限的设备上有效选择重要层进行重训练，实现更好的模型适应性能。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

TL;DR: 提出基于ConvLSTM的深度学习框架，预测地铁线路列车运行间隔的时空传播，为调度员提供实时决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市地铁系统需要高效的实时调度来确保服务可靠性、最大化资源利用率和提升乘客满意度。

Method: 使用卷积长短时记忆网络(ConvLSTM)模型，结合计划终点站间隔和历史间隔数据，预测整个地铁线路的列车运行间隔动态。

Result: 在大规模城市地铁线路数据集上评估，ConvLSTM模型显示出有前景的间隔预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为铁路运营商提供了强大且计算高效的工具，可优化调度策略，显著改善服务一致性和乘客满意度。

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Conclusion: 投资组合感知目标和几何感知归纳偏置对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本分配至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将技术性的反事实解释转化为易于理解的叙述文本，通过知识蒸馏使小型模型在保持推理能力的同时达到与大型模型相当的性能，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Motivation: 现有的测试时算法结合语言模型的生成能力和过程验证器，但验证器的学习错误会导致标准解码技术的灾难性失败，需要更复杂的解码策略来提高鲁棒性。

Method: VGB算法将自回归生成解释为部分生成树上的随机游走，使用过程验证器和基础模型引导转移概率，并采用概率性回溯机制，推广了Sinclair-Jerrum随机游走理论。

Result: 在合成和真实语言建模任务上的实验表明，VGB在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，能够更好地应对验证器错误，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Motivation: 通过高码率量化理论假设，分析MoE模型在大量专家情况下的近似误差特性，为理解MoE学习中的误差权衡提供理论依据。

Method: 基于输入空间分割的MoE模型，每个区域使用零计算推理的常数预测器作为专家，在一维和多维输入情况下分别分析测试误差及其最小化。

Result: 理论推导了一维输入的测试误差最小化分割和专家参数，多维输入的测试误差上界，并分析了专家参数学习的统计特性。

Conclusion: 研究表明MoE学习中近似误差与估计误差的权衡取决于专家数量，为MoE模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过关注校准误差的主动学习方法能有效提升深度神经网络在主动学习中的性能，降低校准和泛化误差。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 学习率预热在现代深度学习中普遍使用，但其理论基础尚不明确，需要从原理上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑性条件，该条件以损失次优性的线性函数约束局部曲率，并具有理想的闭包性质。在此假设下，分析带预热策略的梯度下降算法。

Result: 理论和实验证明，在均方误差和交叉熵损失训练的常见神经网络架构中，该平滑性条件成立。预热策略相比固定步长能实现更快的收敛，建立了上下复杂度界。

Conclusion: 通过语言和视觉模型的实验验证了理论见解，确认了预热策略的实际益处。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Motivation: 联邦学习在资源受限的边缘节点部署面临挑战，传统同步和异步方法存在延迟和收敛慢的问题，特别是在异构大规模网络中。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，使用稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的陈旧度加权聚合策略。

Result: 在500个客户端和90%掉队者的测试中，FTTE比同步联邦学习收敛速度快81%，设备内存使用降低80%，通信负载减少69%，且达到可比或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构和资源受限边缘设备的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Motivation: 传统Q-learning UCB算法在非平稳环境中面临分布偏移问题，学习到的策略在分布变化后可能利用次优奖励，需要开发能够检测和处理分布变化的算法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布偏移，并利用其似然值增强Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量，实现探索与利用的平衡。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB获得更好的遗憾保证；实验显示DQUCB在多个RL任务中具有更低遗憾，在COVID-19患者医院分配任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法有效解决了非平稳强化学习中的分布偏移问题，兼具模型无关RL的计算效率，在理论和实际应用中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码之间真实表征对齐是必要的，不同的叠加排列会干扰对齐度量结果。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，精确准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE准确率为85.9%。EMG数据的加入略微提高了模型准确性，但受到数据质量和放置敏感性的限制。特征分析显示离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Motivation: 现有LLM推理策略如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，特别是在Pass@k评估设置下，这些策略无法随着k和采样预算N的增加而有效扩展。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority (BoM)策略，关键步骤是在选择top-k奖励之前，将候选响应限制在N个样本中出现频率较高的响应中。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω̃(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小最大最优的。实验结果显示BoM在数学问题推理上优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM策略在Pass@k推理设置中实现了最优的扩展性能，且其性能不会随着N的增加而下降，这是多数投票和BoN所不具备的关键优势。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法，通过保护推理火花(reasoning sparks)来解决RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，在数学推理任务上取得了60.17%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法在训练过程中会出现性能平台期，政策熵崩溃导致探索能力丧失。现有方法通常通过维持高政策熵来解决，但缺乏对有意义探索机制的理解，可能放大无关标记并破坏训练稳定性。

Method: 提出Lp-Reg方法，核心机制是通过构造启发式代理分布来正则化政策。该代理分布通过过滤噪声标记并对剩余候选重新归一化得到，其中推理火花的概率被放大，然后作为软正则化目标通过KL散度保护这些有价值标记。

Result: Lp-Reg能够实现约1000步的稳定在线训练，而基准熵控制方法在此阶段会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试上达到60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提升2.66%。

Conclusion: 保护低概率推理火花对于维持RLVR训练中的有效探索至关重要，Lp-Reg方法通过正则化机制成功解决了探索退化问题，实现了更稳定和有效的训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分可观测强化学习中，利用特权专家蒸馏与标准无特权信息RL之间的权衡。通过理论模型和实验发现，该权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，且最优潜在策略并不总是最佳的蒸馏目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观测性是强化学习中的主要挑战，需要学习复杂的历史依赖策略。特权专家蒸馏虽然计算效率高，但存在已知的失败模式，需要系统研究其与标准RL方法的权衡。

Method: 使用理论模型"扰动块MDP"和模拟运动任务的受控实验，对比特权专家蒸馏和标准无特权信息RL方法。

Result: 实验结果表明：(1) 权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性；(2) 最优潜在策略并不总是最佳的蒸馏目标。这些发现与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果为有效利用特权信息提供了新指导原则，有望提升许多实际部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验经济学中常见研究者偏离预分析计划补充非预先指定结果，但如何解释这些非预注册结果存在广泛不确定性，需要开发有效的统计推断方法。

Method: 提出了考虑条件报告性的推断程序，通过Bessone等人(2021)关于城市贫困人口睡眠增加经济影响的研究案例进行应用验证。

Result: 根据偏离原因的不同，新程序的调整效果从无差异到经济显著性差异不等，证明了传统置信区间和点估计在非预注册估计中的无效性。

Conclusion: 开发了针对非预注册估计的稳健推断方法，建议采用启发式检查和期刊规范来应对可能的模型误设问题。

Abstract: Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) have become standard in experimental economics
research, but it is nevertheless common to see researchers deviating from their
PAPs to supplement preregistered estimates with non-prespecified findings.
While such ex-post analysis can yield valuable insights, there is broad
uncertainty over how to interpret -- or whether to even acknowledge --
non-preregistered results. In this paper, we consider the case of a
truth-seeking researcher who, after seeing the data, earnestly wishes to report
additional estimates alongside those preregistered in their PAP. We show that,
even absent "nefarious" behavior, conventional confidence intervals and point
estimators are invalid due to the fact that non-preregistered estimates are
only reported in a subset of potential data realizations. We propose inference
procedures that account for this conditional reporting. We apply these
procedures to Bessone et al. (2021), which studies the economic effects of
increased sleep among the urban poor. We demonstrate that, depending on the
reason for deviating, the adjustments from our procedures can range from having
no difference to an economically significant difference relative to
conventional practice. Finally, we consider the robustness of our procedure to
certain forms of misspecification, motivating possible heuristic checks and
norms for journals to adopt.

Abstract: We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility, extending
the static model of Shapley and Shubik (1971). Forward-looking agents have
individual states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching
market with market-clearing prices takes place. We prove the existence of an
equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and show it is the
solution to a social planner's problem. We also prove that a stationary
equilibrium exists. We introduce econometric shocks to account for unobserved
heterogeneity in match formation. We propose two algorithms to compute a
stationary equilibrium. We adapt both algorithms for estimation. We estimate a
model of accumulation of job-specific human capital using data on Swedish
engineers.

Motivation: 传统通胀预测系统（FPAS和ARIMA）难以处理周期不对称性和意外波动，需要改进预测精度和周期响应能力。

Method: 构建非线性参数t，使用傅里叶谱分析和隐马尔可夫模型识别周期/相位，通过调制系数α最小化RMSE校准混合预测。

Result: FPAS + ζ框架显示更低的RMSE和更优的周期响应性，具备冲击和制度转换的早期预警能力。

Conclusion: 该混合框架对政策机构具有实际应用价值，能提升通胀预测的准确性和及时性。

Abstract: Inflation forecasting is a core socio-economic challenge in modern
macroeconomic modeling, especially when cyclical, structural, and shock factors
act simultaneously. Traditional systems such as FPAS and ARIMA often struggle
with cyclical asymmetry and unexpected fluctuations. This study proposes a
hybrid framework (FPAS + $\zeta$) that integrates a structural macro model
(FPAS) with cyclical components derived from the Riemann zeta function
$\zeta(1/2 + i t)$. Using Georgia's macro data (2005-2024), a nonlinear
argument $t$ is constructed from core variables (e.g., GDP, M3, policy rate),
and the hybrid forecast is calibrated by minimizing RMSE via a modulation
coefficient $\alpha$. Fourier-based spectral analysis and a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) are employed for cycle/phase identification, and a multi-criteria
AHP-TOPSIS scheme compares FPAS, FPAS + $\zeta$, and ARIMA. Results show lower
RMSE and superior cyclical responsiveness for FPAS + $\zeta$, along with
early-warning capability for shocks and regime shifts, indicating practical
value for policy institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来识别代理在实际使用中的失败模式。

Method: 开发BrowserArena平台，收集用户提交的真实任务，进行Arena式头对头比较，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建针对性数据集。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理存在多样性和脆弱性，提出的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM性能的负面影响，同时保持对有益输入的效率和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意或错误的示例可能被注入而未被察觉，从而影响模型性能。

Method: 定义零样本下的安全行为基准，应用分布无关风险控制来限制上下文示例对性能的负面影响，通过动态提前退出机制忽略对不安全输入关注度最高的注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在保证安全性的前提下，平衡LLMs在有害和有益上下文示例下的性能表现，为LLM的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Motivation: 虽然大型多模态模型展现出令人印象深刻的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内在机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解模型内部如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持模型参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些功能向量。

Result: 该方法能显著超越上下文学习基线，并且关系特定的功能向量可以线性组合来解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题，显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统性地提取和优化，从而增进对模型模块化的理解并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical

accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Method: 通过设计跨模态冲突实验场景，分析模型在单模态和多模态上下文中的表现差异。研究发现注意力不平衡问题，并提出通过在训练实例中显式组合多个模态的简单方法来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示，模型在单模态冲突中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态冲突中识别率降至3%。跨语言场景也有类似问题。注意力分析显示模型对某些模态存在极端不对称的注意力分配。提出的训练方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并提升多个视觉-语言基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 基础模型在跨模态推理方面存在显著缺陷，主要源于注意力不平衡。通过显式训练跨模态推理能力可以改善模型性能，强调了系统处理跨模态上下文对于构建可靠基础模型的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [180] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展(TTS)在样本数量K很大时收益递减，提出温度维度扩展方法，通过多温度采样显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法通过增加推理轨迹数量来提升性能，但作者发现这种扩展存在上限，且不同温度能解决不同子问题，单温度扩展只能探索模型潜力的一部分。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，在不同采样温度下生成推理轨迹，并设计多温度投票机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，温度扩展比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，使基础模型性能接近RL训练模型，无需额外后训练。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展比之前认为的更强大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

*Daniel G. Schwartz*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可能性概念，作为Zadeh(1978)标准概念的替代方案，专注于现实世界事件的可能性评估，特别适用于规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可能性理论存在局限性，需要一种更专注于现实世界事件评估的新概念，特别适用于规划问题中评估不同方案的可行性。

Method: 将事件视为具有促成其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束条件，可能性计算为这些先决条件成立且约束条件不成立的概率函数。

Result: 开发了一个基于概率的可能性计算框架，能够评估不同规划方案的可行性，并通过车辆路线规划示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种新的可能性概念能够有效捕捉人类关于规划的推理过程，在规划问题中具有实际应用价值，未来有进一步扩展应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计框架。

Method: 采用动态算子生命周期管理和自动化机器学习技术，包括自动算子生成、融合和消除，动态成本感知优化，在线反馈集成和决策追踪机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，相比最先进方法实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，同时减少3-5%的推理成本，在不同数据集和LLM骨干网络上展现出优越的迁移性。

Conclusion: AutoMaAS为大型语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式，具有持续进化和自适应能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标视觉语言模型的有害输出，在基准测试中达到最先进的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议整合17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击的多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了ARMs-Bench数据集，包含30K+红队实例，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: 基于ARMs-Bench的安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Motivation: 现代制造中APS系统至关重要，但将制造需求转化为正式约束仍依赖手动劳动。虽然LLMs在自动化约束规范方面有潜力，但直接应用面临自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限等挑战。

Method: 采用约束中心架构，定义跨三个层次的分层结构空间，通过领域特定表示确保精度和可靠性，同时设计自动化生产场景适应算法来定制特定制造配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法成功平衡了LLMs的生成能力和制造系统的可靠性要求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: 提出的约束中心架构有效解决了LLMs在制造约束规范中的可靠性问题，为自动化生产调度提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并大幅减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: 将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二进制一致性检查，将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点，避免不必要生成长文本。

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提升10%-25%，同时比传统方法（如基于CoT的验证器）减少6-58倍的token使用。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，提高了LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于多维度评估工具增强型LLM代理性能的框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤中的知识，能够有效评估代理的推理轨迹，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准虽然包含复杂用户请求和多样化工具，但评估方法仍局限于答案匹配。随着解决用户请求所需步骤的增加，需要超越最终答案来评估问题解决轨迹，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等被忽视的方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累前面推理步骤中收集的知识，实现对代理推理轨迹的多方面分析和评估。还开发了元评估数据集，通过向现有基准添加多样化和有缺陷的轨迹来验证框架。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能实现。应用该方法评估代理在解决工具增强任务时产生的轨迹，提供了先前未报告的观察和相应见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强型LLM代理提供了有效的多维度评估方法，能够超越简单的答案匹配，全面评估代理的问题解决轨迹性能。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法真正满足指定目标函数，且开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标，导致目标错误设定不可避免。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示机器学习中普遍但未经检验的假设——训练模型能真正满足指定目标函数(OSA)的局限性，分析其在实际条件下的失败原因和严重后果。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差对OSA的影响，结合Goodhart定律的数学结果，论证目标错误设定的不可避免性。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失败，目标错误设定不可避免，且在没有数学表征的情况下，这些差距与Goodhart定律失效模式无法区分，持续优化可能导致失控。

Conclusion: 由于无法预先确定Goodhart临界点，需要对通用人工智能系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致可预测且不可逆的失控风险。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF/RLAIF依赖单一奖励模型，存在对齐质量限制和过拟合风险。现有RM路由方法面临冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 离线阶段训练多任务路由器评估每个RM的可靠性，在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行每查询RM选择，利用离线嵌入作为高斯先验并自适应更新后验。

Result: 在指令跟随和推理基准测试中，BayesianRouter持续优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过混合路由框架有效提升了语言模型对齐质量，解决了现有路由方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的奖励优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理，rollout过程复杂，这困扰了如GRPO等强化学习方法。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建能够捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一个系统的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用率。可解释AI方法旨在解决这一问题，但这些方法通常由技术背景的工程师开发，融入了他们对解释机制存在性、有效性和解释效用的假设。

Method: 研究可解释AI方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即关于解释存在性以及我们获取这些解释知识能力的假设。分析XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化如何对应于解释基础假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析显示，忽略底层本体论-认识论范式而选择XAI方法存在风险，不同的技术选择对应着不同的解释哲学立场。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体应用领域选择和适配适当的XAI方法，考虑其隐含的本体论和认识论假设，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略的规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习方法在抽象推理方面存在根本局限性，需要超越模式识别、开发具备更强泛化能力的架构来实现稳健的抽象推理。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
