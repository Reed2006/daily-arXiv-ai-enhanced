*Wei Zhou,Bolei Ma,Annemarie Friedrich,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于表格问答(TQA)的综述研究，系统梳理了基于大语言模型的表格问答方法，包括任务分类、挑战分析和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格问答领域缺乏对任务定义、核心挑战和方法趋势的系统性组织，特别是在强化学习等新兴研究方向出现后，需要统一的框架来指导未来发展。

Method: 采用综述研究方法，对现有基准测试和任务设置进行全面分类，根据目标挑战对当前建模策略进行分组，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 提供了TQA研究的结构化概述，统一了分散的研究线索，识别了开放性问题，为TQA社区建立了统一的基础。

Conclusion: 该综述为表格问答领域提供了系统性的理解框架，有助于指导这一快速演进领域的未来发展，特别强调了尚未充分探索但及时的研究主题。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

### [2] [Emotionally Charged, Logically Blurred: AI-driven Emotional Framing Impairs Human Fallacy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09695)
*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM驱动的情绪框架可以降低人类对逻辑谬误的检测能力14.5%，其中恐惧和悲伤情绪比愉悦情绪更容易误导人们，同时这些情绪状态下的论证被认为更具说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑谬误在公共传播中很常见且具有误导性，但说服力是主观的。研究情绪框架如何与谬误和说服力相互作用，特别是在AI生成内容背景下。

Method: 使用大语言模型系统性地改变谬误论证中的情绪诉求，保留逻辑结构但注入情绪吸引力。通过最佳模型生成刺激材料进行人类研究。

Result: 情绪框架平均降低人类谬误检测F1分数14.5%。人类在感知愉悦情绪时比恐惧或悲伤时表现更好，这三种情绪相比中性或其他情绪状态具有显著更高的说服力。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了在谬误论证背景下AI驱动情绪操纵的潜在影响，表明情绪框架可以显著影响人类对逻辑谬误的识别能力和感知说服力。

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

### [3] [The Idola Tribus of AI: Large Language Models tend to perceive order where none exists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09709)
*Shin-nosuke Ishikawa,Masato Todo,Taiki Ogihara,Hirotsugu Ohba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在识别数列规律时存在过度识别不存在模式的倾向，即使在随机数列中也会生成荒谬模式，这揭示了LLMs在逻辑一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂现实任务中的逻辑一致性和自洽性，因为现有方法（如检索增强生成和AI代理框架）都依赖于LLMs的这些能力。

Method: 通过让LLMs解释各种整数序列（从算术序列到随机生成数列）中的模式来进行实验，观察模型在识别规律时的表现。

Result: 模型能成功识别算术和几何序列的正确模式，但在分析随机数列时频繁过度识别与给定数字不一致的模式，即使在多步推理模型中（如OpenAI o3、o4-mini和Google Gemini 2.5）也存在此问题。

Conclusion: LLMs感知不存在模式的倾向类似于Idola Tribus（部落偶像），突显了它们在需要逻辑推理的应用任务中的潜在局限性，即使使用思维链推理机制也难以完全避免。

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

### [4] [SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710)
*Xiaonan Si,Meilin Zhu,Simeng Qin,Lijia Yu,Lijun Zhang,Shuaitong Liu,Xinfeng Li,Ranjie Duan,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SeCon-RAG框架，通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突消除机制，在保持有用知识的同时防御检索增强生成系统中的语料库污染攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG防御方法通常采用激进过滤策略，导致有价值信息丢失和生成可靠性降低，需要一种更智能的防御机制。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用EIRE指导的语义和聚类过滤，第二阶段使用EIRE指导的冲突感知过滤模块分析语义一致性。

Result: 在各种LLM和数据集上的广泛实验表明，SeCon-RAG显著优于最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG通过两阶段过滤过程有效保留有用知识同时减轻冲突污染，显著提高了生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

### [5] [ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09711)
*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM通过残差向量量化将知识图谱嵌入离散化为代码序列，并作为可学习令牌集成到LLM词汇表中，解决了KG嵌入与LLM令牌空间不匹配的问题，在KGC任务上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱补全方法难以充分利用结构化语义表示，因为预训练KG模型的连续嵌入空间与LLM的离散令牌空间存在根本性不匹配，这阻碍了有效的语义传递并限制了性能。

Method: 提出ReaLM框架，通过残差向量量化机制将预训练KG嵌入离散化为紧凑代码序列，并将其作为可学习令牌集成到LLM词汇表中；同时引入本体引导的类别约束来增强语义一致性，基于类别级兼容性优化实体预测。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM实现了最先进的性能，证实了其在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ReaLM成功弥合了KG嵌入与LLM令牌化之间的差距，通过残差向量量化和本体引导约束实现了符号知识与上下文知识的无缝融合，为知识图谱补全任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

### [6] [All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09714)
*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在加密推理中存在不对称性：虽然能准确翻译加密文本，但在加密推理中准确率显著下降，这为规避思维链监控提供了可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛采用，检测有害AI行为变得重要。思维链监控是检测对抗攻击和AI错位的方法，但攻击者可能通过加密推理来规避这种监控。

Method: 测试28种不同密码，对最多10个模型进行微调和提示，让它们在密码中进行推理，使用数学问题作为推理能力的代理指标。

Result: 发现模型在加密推理中存在不对称性：准确率显著下降，尽管能准确翻译加密文本。前沿模型在知名密码中表现良好，但在较少见密码中表现不佳。加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码的流行度相关。

Conclusion: 使用加密推理规避思维链监控对当前模型可能是无效策略，并为约束未来前沿模型发展这种能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

### [7] [Preference-Aware Memory Update for Long-Term LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09720)
*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好感知记忆更新机制(PAMU)，通过结合滑动窗口平均和指数移动平均来动态优化长期记忆表示，提升LLM在长期对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期记忆方法在记忆更新方面存在不足，缺乏根据用户行为和上下文演化动态优化偏好记忆表示的机制。

Method: PAMU机制整合滑动窗口平均(SW)和指数移动平均(EMA)，构建融合的偏好感知表示，捕捉短期波动和长期用户倾向。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景实验中，该机制显著提升了五个基线模型的输出质量。

Conclusion: PAMU机制在长期对话中有效提升了LLM的性能，验证了动态记忆更新的重要性。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

TL;DR: 提出一个布局感知且效率优化的自动化简历信息提取框架，解决简历格式异构性、LLM高成本高延迟、缺乏标准化数据集三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化简历信息提取对规模化人才招聘至关重要，但在实际部署中面临三大挑战：简历布局和内容的极端异构性、大语言模型的高成本和延迟、缺乏标准化数据集和评估工具。

Method: 结合微调布局解析器标准化文档格式、基于并行提示和指令调优的推理高效LLM提取器、以及由新基准数据集支持的鲁棒两阶段自动化评估框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该框架在准确性和效率上显著优于强基线。特别是，微调的0.6B紧凑LLM在实现顶级准确性的同时，显著降低推理延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该系统已在阿里巴巴智能HR平台全面部署，支持其业务部门的实时应用，证明了框架在实际场景中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

*Yubo Sun,Chunyi Peng,Yukun Yan,Shi Yu,Zhenghao Liu,Chi Chen,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVisRAG是一个端到端的视觉检索增强生成框架，通过证据引导的多图像推理来减少幻觉并增强推理能力，使用RS-GRPO训练方法在多个VQA基准上平均提升27%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VRAG系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面不可靠，导致推理基础薄弱和错误结论，需要改进多图像证据感知和整合能力。

Method: 提出EVisRAG框架：先观察检索图像并记录每张图像证据，然后从聚合证据推导最终答案；引入RS-GRPO训练方法，将细粒度奖励绑定到范围特定token，联合优化VLM的视觉感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答基准测试中，EVisRAG相比骨干VLM平均提升27%性能；分析显示模型能精确感知和定位问题相关证据，并基于证据推导最终答案。

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过证据引导的多图像推理框架和RS-GRPO训练方法，显著提升了VLM的视觉感知和推理能力，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

### [10] [Judge's Verdict: A Comprehensive Analysis of LLM Judge Capability Through Human Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09738)
*Steve Han,Gilberto Titericz Junior,Tom Balough,Wenfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Judge's Verdict Benchmark，一个两步骤评估LLMs作为响应准确性评估法官的方法，测试了54个LLMs在RAG或Agentic管道响应评分中复制人类判断的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在响应准确性评估任务中作为法官的能力，特别是它们能否复制人类判断，以及仅依赖相关性分析是否足够。

Method: 采用两步骤方法：首先进行相关性测试筛选出与人类判断高度一致的模型，然后使用z分数进行人类相似性测试，识别人类样判断（|z| < 1）和超一致判断（z > 1）两种模式。

Result: 54个测试模型中，27个达到Tier 1性能：23个模型展示人类样判断模式，4个模型展示超一致行为。法官优秀性不仅依赖模型大小，还依赖特定训练策略。

Conclusion: 相关性分析不足以评估法官能力，提出了基于一致性模式的"法官图灵测试"，并提供了标准化基准将LLM法官分类到不同性能层级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

*Adam Byerly,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Gold Panning Bandits框架，利用LLM的位置偏见作为诊断信号，通过重新排序文档来高效识别相关内容，相比随机排列基线减少65%的查询次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档环境中存在强烈的位置偏见，现有方法将其视为需要缓解的噪声，但作者认为可以将其转化为诊断信号

Method: 将文档重新排序问题建模为二分图匹配问题，提出贪心O(N log N)策略，将最不确定的文档放在最具信息量的位置

Result: 在知识密集型NLP任务中，相比随机排列基线，该方法使用最多65%更少的语言模型查询来识别相关文档

Conclusion: 固有的LLM偏见可以从负担转化为资产，实现高效的推理时优化，无需模型重新训练

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

*Rakib Hossan,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个用于孟加拉语仇恨言论分类的少样本框架，结合卡方统计分析和自适应多数投票机制，在BLP-2025 Task 1A中取得了67.61的micro-F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，这对于低资源语言来说成本高昂。因此需要开发少样本学习框架来解决孟加拉语仇恨言论分类问题。

Method: 使用卡方统计分析进行关键词提取，结合自适应多数投票机制进行决策。比较了统计关键词选择与随机方法，以及基于共识质量的自适应投票机制。

Result: PromptGuard取得了67.61的micro-F1分数，优于n-gram基线（60.75）和随机方法（14.65）。卡方关键词在所有类别中都表现出最一致的影响。

Conclusion: 卡方关键词提取提供了跨类别的一致改进，而自适应投票机制对需要扩展分类轮次的模糊情况特别有益。该方法在低资源环境下有效解决了孟加拉语仇恨言论分类问题。

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

*Michael Freenor,Lauren Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RISE方法通过旋转操作在嵌入空间中表示语义转换，在多语言和模型间具有高迁移性，支持句子级别的线性表示假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言和嵌入模型如何编码语义关系对模型可解释性和控制至关重要，但现代高维文本表示缺乏直观的几何特性。

Method: 引入Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE)方法，将语义转换表示为嵌入空间中一致的旋转操作，利用现代语言表示的流形结构。

Result: 在3个嵌入模型、3个数据集和7种形态多样的语言上评估，RISE能一致地映射具有不同语法特征的语篇级语义转换。

Conclusion: 首次系统证明语篇级语义转换对应于多语言嵌入空间中的一致几何操作，为句子级别的线性表示假设提供实证支持。

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

TL;DR: NarraBench是一个理论驱动的叙事理解任务分类法，调查了78个现有基准，发现当前评估仅覆盖27%的叙事任务，许多关键方面如事件、风格、视角和启示几乎缺失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前叙事理解评估存在显著不足，许多重要方面被忽视或与现有指标不匹配，需要开发能够评估主观性和视角性方面的新基准。

Method: 提出了理论驱动的叙事理解任务分类法，并对78个现有基准进行了系统性调查和分析。

Result: 发现现有基准仅覆盖27%的叙事任务，叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等关键方面几乎缺失，需要开发评估主观性方面的基准。

Conclusion: 该分类法、调查和方法论对NLP研究人员测试LLM叙事理解能力具有重要价值，揭示了当前评估的不足和未来发展方向。

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBia是一个轻量级对抗攻击套件，通过构造对话让LLMs表达偏见主张，然后评估模型能否从虚构的偏见中恢复并拒绝偏见性后续问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs通过了标准安全检查，但在对话中仍可能表现出有害行为，如表达种族主义观点。需要系统性地分析LLMs在何种条件下偏离规范或道德行为。

Method: 创建构造对话让模型表达关于社会群体的偏见主张，然后评估模型能否恢复并拒绝偏见性后续问题。评估11个开源和专有LLMs在6个社会人口类别上的表现。

Result: 有目的构建的对话能可靠地揭示偏见放大，LLMs在对话中经常无法拒绝偏见性后续问题。压力测试突显了通过互动可显现的深层嵌入偏见。

Conclusion: 这种形式的压力测试揭示了LLMs中深层嵌入的偏见，这些偏见可以通过互动显现出来。

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

### [18] [iBERT: Interpretable Style Embeddings via Sense Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09882)
*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT是一个可解释的BERT编码器，通过稀疏非负混合的上下文无关意义向量来表示输入标记，能够模块化地控制和解释嵌入表示中的判别性线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统BERT模型缺乏可解释性和可控性的问题，设计能够模块化暴露语言中判别性线索（如风格和语义结构）的嵌入表示。

Method: 使用稀疏非负混合的k个上下文无关意义向量来表示每个输入标记，这些向量可以池化为句子嵌入或在标记级别直接使用，实现表示的可控模块化。

Result: 在STEL基准测试中，iBERT比SBERT风格基线在风格表示效果上提高了约8个点，同时在作者身份验证上保持竞争力，并能将特定风格属性（如表情符号使用、正式性、拼写错误）分配给特定意义向量。

Conclusion: iBERT通过结构模块化能够可解释地分解数据中存在的判别性信号，即使在监督混合风格和语义因素的情况下也能实现泛化，不仅限于风格建模。

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过将Transformer层分为三组：初始全注意力层、选择层和稀疏注意力层，在保持推理准确性的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解码过程中需要关注整个增长的序列，计算成本高昂。现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少计算，但在推理任务上会导致严重的准确性下降。

Method: 将Transformer层分为三组：初始层使用全注意力，少量选择层通过聚合头级注意力分数识别重要token，后续稀疏注意力层仅关注选定的子集。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准测试中，DELTA在准确性上匹配或超越全注意力，同时将关注的token数量减少5倍，端到端速度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: 选择性重用中间注意力图为高效长上下文推理提供了稳健的路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出溯因偏好学习，通过反转传统条件学习来改进大语言模型的过度自信问题，在响应选择和提示辨别任务上均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿大语言模型即使经过RLHF和DPO对齐后仍存在过度自信问题，无法区分需要不同回答的反事实提示。现有偏好学习强调为给定提示选择正确响应，但忽略了应该改变响应的反事实提示。

Method: 提出溯因偏好学习，通过反转传统条件学习来学习给定响应下的提示偏好。构建包含1001个条目的溯因数据集，实现溯因DPO及其变体DPOP，并采用多任务目标统一两种方法。

Result: 在溯因数据集上，多任务DPOP将响应选择准确率从90.0%提升至99.5%，提示辨别准确率从54.7%提升至85.0%。在AlpacaEval上，胜率从5.26%提升至6.17%。

Conclusion: 溯因偏好学习在保持传统偏好优化优势的同时，解决了反事实提示这一被忽视的挑战，显著提升模型对提示差异的敏感性。

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法难以捕捉跨多帖子的上下文信息，在语义稀疏环境中无法提取具有代表性和鲁棒性的特征。

Method: 使用LLM模拟大脑皮层进行全局语义推理和深度特征抽象；动态记忆模块模拟前额叶皮层进行自适应门控和选择性保留；专门化轻量模型模拟基底神经节通过赢家通吃机制动态路由。

Result: 在Kaggle和Pandora数据集上的大量实验表明，HIPPD持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 受大脑启发的分层信息处理框架能有效提升文本性格检测的性能，证明了神经科学原理在自然语言处理任务中的价值。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐训练存在权衡：提升语言模型的推理和指令跟随能力，但可能牺牲创造性和校准等技能。目标是通过模型协作实现最佳平衡。

Method: 训练一个切换器语言模型，学习在不同查询和上下文中选择不同模型生成下一段文本。推理时，切换器指导不同模型检查点动态生成各自擅长的文本段。

Result: 在18个数据集上的实验表明：1）模型协作在16个任务上优于单个模型；2）Switch Generation比基线平均提升12.9%。该方法能发现组合技能解决单个模型难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: Switch Generation能够有效重用和重新利用昂贵模型训练流程中的副产品，泛化到未见过的模型和任务，实现模型间的优势互补。

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能够生成流畅的摘要，但经常产生包含幻觉的不忠实摘要，现有缓解策略未能充分解决这一问题。

Method: 使用多种LLM自动生成训练集摘要，用GPT-4o进行span级幻觉标注，然后采用梯度上升、unlikelihood训练和任务向量否定三种微调方法。

Result: 实验结果显示所有三种方法都能利用span级标注提高忠实度，其中unlikelihood训练最为有效。

Conclusion: 基于span级标注的微调策略能够有效提升LLM生成摘要的忠实度，为减少摘要幻觉提供了新途径。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法主要依赖预训练语言模型，但较少关注仇恨表情包的本质特征。基于哲学和心理学见解，认为仇恨表情包具有预设上下文和虚假声明两个关键特征。

Method: 开发PCM模块建模多模态上下文信息，引入FACT模块整合外部知识并利用跨模态参考图检测虚假声明，结合两者构建SHIELD框架。

Result: 在多个数据集和指标上优于最先进方法，并在假新闻检测等其他任务上表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SHIELD框架通过捕捉仇恨表情包的本质特征，实现了更有效的检测性能，并展示了在多任务上的应用潜力。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

TL;DR: 提出单令牌保留率(STRR)作为评估分词器跨语言公平性的新指标，揭示现有分词器对英语的系统性优先支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词评估指标fertility（平均每个词的令牌数）只关注压缩效率，但掩盖了词汇表在不同语言和领域间的分配差异，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 分析6个广泛使用的分词器在7种语言和2个领域中的表现，提出STRR指标来衡量单词被保留为单个令牌的比例。

Result: 发现英语的fertility稳定，中文的fertility较高，领域敏感性低；STRR显示英语被系统性优先支持，中文得到强支持，而印地语出现碎片化。

Conclusion: STRR补充了fertility指标，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供了实用指导，提供了跨语言公平性的可解释视图。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Motivation: 当前LLM研究中的审议树搜索领域缺乏统一的形式化框架，特别是在奖励信号的角色上存在模糊性——它究竟是瞬时启发式还是持久学习目标。

Method: 引入一个统一框架，将搜索算法解构为三个核心组件：搜索机制、奖励制定和转移函数，并建立搜索指导与参数奖励建模之间的形式化区别。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决LLM审议树搜索领域的碎片化问题提供了系统化方法，推动该领域向更系统化的方向发展。

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Result: 非双语用户由于缺乏评估策略和替代方案而经常过度依赖机器翻译，但经历错误影响会促使用户重新评估未来的依赖。

Conclusion: 机器翻译评估和NLP解释技术不仅需要提升机器翻译质量，还需要促进用户对机器翻译的素养。

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

TL;DR: 提出ExpandSearch方法，通过强化学习训练LLM搜索代理进行查询扩展，结合预训练压缩模型理解检索文档，在7个问答基准测试中平均提升4.4%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理增强搜索代理在复杂多跳问答任务中表现不佳，主要受限于推理和搜索能力不足，难以处理复合查询

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM搜索代理进行查询扩展，同时引入预训练压缩模型帮助理解检索文档，让搜索代理专注于查询生成以提高检索召回率

Result: 在7个问答基准测试中平均提升4.4%准确率，在多跳推理任务上表现优异，即使3B规模的小型LLM也能展现强大的查询扩展能力

Conclusion: 结合查询扩展和文档理解压缩模型的方法能显著提升多跳问答性能，小规模模型也能实现SOTA效果

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

*Yuyi Huang,Runzhe Zhan,Lidia S. Chao,Ailin Tao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现大语言模型在长链思维推理中存在路径漂移漏洞，即推理轨迹会偏离安全对齐路径，产生违反安全约束的内容。作者提出了路径漂移诱导框架和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型通过RLHF等技术进行了安全对齐，但在长链思维推理中，推理轨迹可能会偏离安全路径，产生不安全内容，这一漏洞此前未被充分探索。

Method: 通过实证分析识别了三种路径漂移行为触发因素，并提出了三阶段路径漂移诱导框架（认知负荷放大、自我角色启动、条件链劫持）来验证漏洞。同时提出了路径级防御策略，包括角色归因修正和元认知反思。

Result: 研究发现三种行为触发因素都能独立降低模型的拒绝率，而它们的组合效果更显著。路径级防御策略能有效缓解路径漂移风险。

Conclusion: 长格式推理需要超越词元级对齐的轨迹级对齐监督，以确保推理路径始终符合安全约束。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在医疗场景下使用轻量级BERT模型进行医学摘要分类，发现DistilBERT在交叉熵损失下表现最佳，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗部署中面临成本、延迟和隐私限制，需要探索轻量级模型的可行性。

Method: 使用医学摘要语料库，固定分词器、序列长度、优化器和调度，对BERT base和DistilBERT进行微调，比较标准交叉熵、类别加权交叉熵和焦点损失三种目标函数。

Result: DistilBERT在标准交叉熵损失下在测试集上表现最佳，同时使用的参数远少于BERT base。报告了准确率、宏F1和加权F1指标。

Conclusion: 建议从紧凑编码器和交叉熵开始，然后添加校准和任务特定检查，最后再考虑更重的模型。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HUME框架，用于测量文本嵌入任务中的人类表现，并与模型性能进行比较，揭示了模型在低资源语言中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架如MTEB缺乏可靠的人类表现基准，限制了模型分数的可解释性。需要建立人类表现基准来更好地理解嵌入模型的优势和局限。

Method: 引入HUME框架，在16个MTEB数据集上测量人类表现，涵盖重排序、分类、聚类和语义文本相似性任务，涉及高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 人类平均表现达到77.6%，而最佳嵌入模型为80.1%。模型在某些数据集上接近天花板性能，但在其他数据集上表现不佳，特别是在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 提供了人类表现基准、任务难度模式洞察和可扩展评估框架，有助于更准确地解释模型性能并指导模型和基准的开发。

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,
and leaderboard are publicly available at

TL;DR: CLMN是一个神经符号框架，通过连续可读的概念嵌入和模糊逻辑推理，在保持性能的同时提升NLP模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有概念瓶颈模型在NLP中要么使用二元激活损害文本表示，要么使用潜在概念削弱语义，且很少建模动态概念交互的问题。

Method: 将概念表示为连续的人类可读嵌入，应用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，增强原始文本特征并自动推导可解释逻辑规则。

Result: 在多个数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念的方法获得更高准确率，同时提升解释质量。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间中整合神经表示与符号推理可以产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专注于推理的大语言模型在法律领域处理复杂问题的能力尚未充分探索，需要解决法律知识不足、推理逻辑不可靠和业务泛化能力弱三大挑战。

Method: 构建高质量的法律推理数据集Unilaw-R1-Data（17K个思维链样本），采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的两阶段训练策略。

Result: Unilaw-R1在权威基准测试中表现强劲，超越所有同规模模型，性能与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B（54.9%）相当，在LawBench和LexEval上平均超过Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct 6.6%。

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1证明了轻量级模型通过专门的数据集和训练策略可以在法律推理领域取得优异表现，为法律AI应用提供了可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO是一种新的偏好优化方法，通过显式建模用户提示中的潜在意图，将意图-响应相似性纳入奖励函数，实现更好的偏好对齐和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如DPO）往往默认多数观点，忽视少数意见，无法捕捉提示中的潜在用户意图。人类偏好具有多样性和动态性，受地区、文化和社会因素影响。

Method: 引入意图模块推断用户提示背后的潜在意图，并将推断的意图显式纳入奖励函数，通过意图-响应相似性项增加偏好边界，实现更清晰的首选与不首选响应分离。

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著超越现有基线：Real-pref上胜率提升24.8%，响应意图一致性提升45.6%；Attack-pref上响应相似性提升38.6%，防御成功率提升52.2%；GlobalOpinionQA-Ext上意图一致性得分提升54.6%。

Conclusion: A-IPO通过显式建模多样化用户意图，促进多元化偏好优化，同时增强偏好对齐的对抗鲁棒性，在理论和实证上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化摘要面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，现有数据集如MS/CAS PENS缺乏目标摘要且主题转换多样性有限，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PerAugy数据增强技术，包括跨轨迹重排和摘要内容扰动，用于增强个性化摘要训练数据的多样性。

Result: PerAugy显著提升了四种SOTA用户编码器的准确性（最佳结果：AUC提升0.132），并使两个SOTA摘要框架的个性化程度平均提升61.2%。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性是驱动个性化摘要性能提升的关键因素，TP和DegreeD多样性指标与用户编码器性能强相关。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

TL;DR: REFRAIN是一个无需训练的自适应推理停止框架，通过识别冗余推理和动态调整停止阈值，在保持准确性的同时减少20-55%的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然提升了LLMs在推理任务上的表现，但过度推理会增加推理成本并导致错误结论，需要解决何时停止推理的问题。

Method: 结合两阶段停止判别器识别反射性但冗余的推理，以及滑动窗口上置信区间多臂老虎机控制器动态调整停止阈值。

Result: 在四个代表性基准测试和两个模型家族上，REFRAIN在保持或提高准确性的同时，将token使用量减少了20-55%。

Conclusion: 何时停止推理是测试时扩展的一个新且实用的维度，使模型能够进行恰到好处的推理而非过度推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在处理大规模非结构化语料时效果有限，而现有的图增强RAG方法依赖不稳定且昂贵的关系提取，导致构建的图噪声大、关系不一致，从而降低检索质量。

Method: LinearRAG构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph），仅使用轻量级实体提取和语义链接，避免不稳定的关系建模。采用两阶段检索策略：通过局部语义桥接激活相关实体，然后通过全局重要性聚合进行段落检索。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，LinearRAG显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LinearRAG提供了一种经济可靠的原始段落索引方法，图构建规模与语料大小呈线性关系，且不产生额外token消耗，实现了高效可靠的图构建和精确的段落检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合OCR引擎和LLM的系统框架，用于优化复制密集型文档的信息提取，通过智能策略选择实现准确性和效率的最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复制密集型文档（包含大量结构相似内容）在企业文档处理中是一个关键但研究不足的挑战，需要解决重复性文档提取任务中的准确性与效率权衡问题。

Method: 开发了系统框架，结合OCR引擎和LLM，通过智能策略选择利用文档特定特征。实现了三种提取范式（直接、替换和基于表格）的25种配置，在四种格式（PNG、DOCX、XLSX、PDF）的身份文档上进行评估。

Result: 基于表格的提取方法取得了出色结果：结构化文档F1=1.0准确率，延迟0.97秒；具有挑战性的图像输入F1=0.997准确率，延迟0.6秒（与PaddleOCR集成），同时保持亚秒级处理速度。相比朴素方法，性能提升54倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了一个通用原则：通过结构感知方法选择，可以将复制密集型任务的重复性从计算负担转化为优化机会，适用于异构文档流的规模化处理。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注偏见输出的出现时机，但缺乏对生成机制的深入理解，导致现有缓解方法脆弱且效果有限。

Method: 1. 比较直接回答(DA)和思维链(CoT)提示策略；2. 定义token-to-head贡献分数追踪偏见来源；3. 提出DiffHeads框架通过差异激活分析识别偏见头并选择性屏蔽。

Result: DA提示使偏见增加534.5%-391.9%；发现一小簇偏见头在DA下激活但在CoT下休眠；DiffHeads在DA和CoT下分别减少不公平性49.4%和40.3%。

Conclusion: DiffHeads提供了一种轻量级、有效的LLM去偏方法，通过因果机制理解偏见生成，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低不公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

Motivation: 多LLM系统虽然能增强创造力，但存在计算成本高和推理延迟大的问题，需要一种在单个模型中实现多LLM协作优势的方法。

Method: 在模型激活空间中提取多个不同的角色向量并进行融合，在推理时使用融合后的向量引导生成过程，无需显式的多LLM通信。

Result: 在创造力导向的基准测试中，BILLY超越了单模型提示和传统多LLM方法，同时大幅减少了推理时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过融合不同角色向量，BILLY能够有效控制生成的互补方面，并提高可解释性，为多LLM协作提供了高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

Motivation: 随着LLM从客观任务转向主观决策应用，其黑盒特性和类人生成内容带来了幻觉、偏见、不公平和版权侵权等风险，需要多角度信息溯源来增强透明度。

Method: 构建了四维溯源框架：模型溯源（区分LLM与人类内容）、模型结构溯源（分析内部生成机制）、训练数据溯源（内部归因）、外部数据溯源（外部验证），并分类为先验和后验两种方法。

Result: 提出了系统化的LLM内容溯源框架和分类体系，为增强LLM部署的透明度、问责制和可信度提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Motivation: 归纳推理是LLMs的重要任务，具有从特殊到一般的思维过程和非唯一答案的特点，对知识泛化和人类认知至关重要，但缺乏系统性总结。

Method: 将改进归纳推理的方法分为三类：后训练、测试时扩展和数据增强；提出了基于沙盒的统一评估方法，使用观察覆盖率指标。

Conclusion: 归纳推理是LLMs学习的基本模式，本文为理解归纳能力来源和优化模型架构及数据提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的多智能体医疗咨询系统评估主要关注最终答案准确性，忽视了推理过程的透明性和可验证性，这在高风险医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: 对六个医疗数据集和六个代表性多智能体框架的3,600个案例进行大规模实证研究，采用定性分析和定量审计相结合的混合方法。

Result: 定量审计揭示了四种主要失败模式：共享模型缺陷驱动的错误共识、正确少数意见被压制、无效讨论动态以及合成过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅靠高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，需要透明和可审计的推理过程，这是医疗AI负责任开发和部署的基础。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

Motivation: 现实场景中训练数据常包含噪声标签，传统方法通过小损失样本选择训练，但初始选择不准确会形成恶性循环，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Delora框架，引入干净和噪声LoRA建立噪声标签检测器，利用记忆效应让干净LoRA记忆干净数据，噪声LoRA记忆误标数据作为可学习阈值来筛选样本。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声数据集上的实验表明，Delora在噪声标签检测和文本分类任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: Delora通过解耦样本选择和模型训练，成功解决了噪声标签环境下的模型微调问题，提高了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

TL;DR: SyTTA是一个无需标签的测试时自适应框架，通过结合输入侧困惑度和输出侧预测熵两种不确定性信号，在分布偏移情况下实时调整语言模型，在多个领域特定基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域部署时面临训练数据分布偏移的挑战，而领域特定微调需要昂贵且缓慢收集的高质量标注数据，特别是在专业知识有限的场景下。

Method: SyTTA框架耦合两种互补的不确定性信号：输入侧困惑度（反映与领域特定术语和模式的失配）和输出侧预测熵（反映生成过程中标记概率的分散和不稳定性），在推理时无需额外监督即可自适应调整模型。

Result: 在多样化模型架构和领域特定基准测试中，SyTTA带来了一致的性能提升。特别是在农业问答任务上，Qwen-2.5-7B模型的Rouge-LSum指标提升了超过120%，每个查询仅需额外4个标记。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需标注示例即可实现语言模型的有效测试时自适应，支持在标签稀缺领域中的部署应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有研究发现高质量文本表示与输入文本的关键token对齐，揭示了表示空间与词汇空间的潜在联系。受此启发，作者重新审视生成任务，开发无监督生成框架用于文本表示学习。

Method: 提出Text2Token框架，基于token目标预测任务，使用精心构建的目标token分布作为监督信号。通过分析token对齐特性，识别出两类关键token：文本中有意义的token和文本之外的语义衍生token。提出数据驱动和模型衍生两种方法构建合成token目标。

Result: 在MTEB v2基准测试中，Text2Token达到了与最先进的无监督对比学习方法LLM2Vec竞争的性能。分析显示词汇空间和表示空间在训练过程中共同优化并趋向最优解。

Conclusion: Text2Token为无监督文本表示学习提供了新的思路和见解，展示了生成式方法在文本表示学习中的潜力，词汇空间和表示空间的共同优化为未来工作提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Result: 广泛实验证明ImCoref-CeS的有效性，相比现有SOTA方法实现了更优性能

Conclusion: ImCoref-CeS框架成功整合了监督神经方法和LLM的优势，在共指消解任务中取得了突破性进展

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

Method: 审计理解框架包含三个阶段：(1)将查询分解为候选假设，(2)审计这些假设的支持证据，(3)仅基于已验证子集进行推理。该框架形式化为后验约束推理

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上显著提升准确性和忠实性，相比Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding方法，在GSM8K上提升达+30%，MultiArith上+45%，SVAMP上持续提升20-28%

Conclusion: 审计理解框架能有效约束推理过程，减少推理诱导的幻觉，同时提供理论保证和实际性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有后门攻击防御方法依赖不切实际的触发器设置假设，而实际中后门攻击通过公共检查点嵌入到大型语言模型中，构成严重威胁。

Method: 基于后门在表示空间中聚合的关键观察，采用两阶段过程：首先通过注入已知触发器聚合后门表示，然后进行恢复微调来恢复良性输出。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的实验表明：平均攻击成功率降至4.41%，优于现有基线28.1%~69.3%；清洁准确率和效用保持在原始模型的0.5%以内；防御方法对不同类型后门具有泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需预知触发器设置的情况下有效防御后门攻击，保持模型性能，具有实际部署的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 多语言大语言模型需要在不同语言间保持事实知识的一致性，但目前对这种一致性的机制及其失败原因理解不足。

Method: 通过实体级翻译任务评估对齐，提出SubSub和SubInj两种方法，将英文实体翻译整合到多语言提示中，并分析模型内部枢轴语言处理机制。

Result: 研究发现一致性与实体对齐强相关，提出的方法显著提高了事实回忆准确性和跨语言一致性。

Conclusion: 实体表示对齐在多语言事实预测中至关重要，通过整合英文实体翻译可以有效改善模型性能，提供实用的多语言事实预测策略。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如DeepConf虽然有效但计算开销大，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在多个开源模型和挑战性多模态推理基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 为高级语言模型的高效可扩展测试时推理策略设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

Method: 提出一个分析框架，研究LLMs的认知和情感共情如何随交叉人口属性变化，涵盖315个由年龄、文化和性别组合构成的独特用户画像，在四个LLMs上进行测试。

Result: 人口属性显著影响模型的共情反应，多重属性组合会减弱甚至逆转预期的共情模式。模型总体上反映了现实世界的共情趋势，但对某些群体（如儒家文化群体）存在明显偏差。

Conclusion: 强调设计具有人口多样性意识的共情感知LLMs的重要性，以促进更包容和公平的模型行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Motivation: 探索结合预训练语音编码器和大型语言模型的端到端架构，以同时处理自动语音识别和语音翻译任务，提高翻译性能并简化系统架构。

Method: 采用预训练语音编码器与大型语言模型结合的端到端架构，同时执行语音识别和语音翻译。

Result: 在英德语言对实验中，最佳模型在COMET DA22指标上比SeamlessM4T提升8%，并能匹配Whisper和NLLB级联系统的性能。

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

*Hakyung Sung,Kristopher Kyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为ASC分析器的Python包，用于自动标注论元结构构式并计算50个指标，以衡量二语写作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的论元结构构式分析工具在可扩展性和系统性方面有限，需要开发更有效的工具来评估二语熟练度。

Method: 创建ASC分析器Python包，自动标注论元结构构式，计算多样性、比例、频率和构式-动词关联强度等50个指标。

Result: 通过双变量和多变量分析，验证了ASC指标与二语写作分数之间的关系。

Conclusion: ASC分析器为二语熟练度评估提供了可扩展且系统的工具，能够有效捕捉写作能力差异。

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

*Aashiq Muhamed,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Markus Dreyer,Virginia Smith,Mona T. Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了语言模型在RAG系统中基于有缺陷上下文选择拒绝回答的能力存在显著问题，提出了RefusalBench评估框架来动态测试这种关键能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中语言模型基于有缺陷上下文选择拒绝回答的能力对安全性至关重要，但现有模型在这方面表现不佳，且静态基准测试存在局限性。

Method: 引入RefusalBench生成方法，通过受控语言扰动程序化创建诊断测试用例，包含176种扰动策略、6类信息不确定性和3个强度级别。

Result: 评估30多个模型发现系统性失败模式：拒绝能力包含可分离的检测和分类技能，规模和扩展推理都不能改善性能，选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力。

Conclusion: 选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力，提供了明确的改进路径，并发布了两个基准测试集和完整生成框架用于持续动态评估。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

TL;DR: 提出AssoMem框架，通过构建关联记忆图来改进大规模记忆中的问答召回性能，在相似性密集场景下优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖语义距离进行检索，但在相似性密集场景中效果有限，受人类关联信息方式启发，需要更好的记忆检索方法

Method: 构建关联记忆图，将对话话语锚定到自动提取的线索上，整合多维检索信号（相关性、重要性、时间对齐），使用自适应互信息融合策略

Result: 在三个基准测试和新数据集MeetingQA上的广泛实验表明，AssoMem持续优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: AssoMem在上下文感知记忆召回方面具有优越性，验证了关联记忆图方法的有效性

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了STEAM框架，通过语义层面的知识编辑来增强更新知识在模型知识结构中的整合，解决了现有方法在语义连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注token级似然优化，缺乏语义连贯性考虑，导致编辑后的知识在潜在空间中形成孤立的残差流，绕过自然推理过程。

Method: STEAM首先识别目标表示作为更新事实关联的语义锚点，然后通过对齐损失在优化过程中引导编辑事实的内部表示朝向这些锚点。

Result: 实验结果表明STEAM提高了模型使用编辑知识进行推理的能力，并增强了语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对于可靠和连贯的知识编辑至关重要，STEAM框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

*Federica Bologna,Tiffany Pan,Matthew Wilkens,Yue Guo,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongQAEval是一个用于评估长格式临床问答系统的框架，通过比较粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估方法，发现在正确性维度上细粒度标注效果更好，在相关性维度上粗粒度标注效果更好，安全性评估则始终不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估长格式临床问答系统需要医学专业知识且资源密集，人工判断在长文本上难以保持一致性，因此需要开发有效的评估框架。

Method: 基于300个真实患者问题的医生和LLM回答，比较粗粒度答案级与细粒度句子级评估方法，分析正确性、相关性和安全性三个维度的标注者间一致性。

Result: 不同维度的标注者间一致性不同：细粒度标注在正确性上表现更好，粗粒度标注在相关性上表现更好，安全性评估始终不一致。仅标注少量句子即可达到与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: LongQAEval提供了资源有限和高专业要求环境下的评估建议，细粒度句子级标注能提高正确性评估的可靠性，而仅标注部分句子即可有效降低评估成本。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN基准测试发现当前大型音频语言模型主要依赖词汇线索而非声学信息来理解情感，表现出词汇主导现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型音频语言模型是否真正处理声学信息还是主要依赖词汇内容来理解情感。

Method: 开发LISTEN基准测试，通过控制词汇和声学线索的对齐与冲突来评估6个最先进模型。

Result: 模型在词汇线索中性或缺失时预测"中性"，线索对齐时改进有限，线索冲突时无法区分情感，副语言场景中表现接近随机。

Conclusion: 当前LALMs主要"转录"而非"倾听"，过度依赖词汇语义而未能充分利用声学线索。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

TL;DR: RECON框架通过集成显式摘要模块压缩检索证据，减少35%上下文长度，提升RAG系统训练速度和推理延迟，同时在下游QA基准上提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于强化学习的检索增强生成系统存在上下文管理效率低下的问题，长而嘈杂的检索文档会增加成本并降低性能。

Method: 引入RECON框架，在推理循环中集成显式摘要模块压缩证据。摘要器通过两阶段训练：在QA数据集上进行相关性预训练，然后从专有LLM进行多方面蒸馏以确保事实性和清晰度。

Result: RECON将总上下文长度减少35%，提升训练速度和推理延迟。在3B模型上平均EM分数提升14.5%，7B模型提升3.0%，在多跳QA任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 学习型上下文压缩对于构建实用、可扩展且高性能的RAG系统至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is
made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLMs在检索增强生成中的过度拒绝问题，提出了SafeRAG-Steering方法来减少对良性查询的拒绝，同时保持对有害内容的合理拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐导致过度拒绝问题，即在检索增强生成中，即使面对良性查询也会因安全过滤器过于激进而拒绝回答。

Method: 构建RagRefuse基准测试，分析查询意图和检索上下文对拒绝行为的影响；提出SafeRAG-Steering方法，通过模型中心的嵌入干预在推理时将嵌入区域导向确认安全的非拒绝输出区域。

Result: 研究发现上下文安排/污染、查询和上下文领域、有害文本密度等因素会触发对良性查询的拒绝，且效果取决于模型特定的对齐选择。SafeRAG-Steering方法能有效减少污染RAG管道中的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: SafeRAG-Steering方法能在保持对有害内容合理拒绝的同时，有效缓解检索增强生成中的过度拒绝问题。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新的对齐方法来解决语音识别中语音长度与文本长度不匹配的问题：时间独立性损失(TIL)和基于编辑距离的对齐交叉熵损失(AXELoss)，结合关键帧融合技术，在AISHELL数据集上显著减少了帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTC方法在将语音下采样到与文本相似长度时无法正确对齐语音和文本，特别是在语音长度与文本长度接近的情况下存在对齐挑战。

Method: 提出了时间独立性损失(TIL)和对齐交叉熵损失(AXELoss)两种对齐方法，并采用关键帧融合技术，通过加权求和关键帧及其上下文2帧来增强关键帧信息。

Result: 在AISHELL-1和AISHELL-2数据集子集上的实验结果表明，所提方法优于先前工作，帧数减少了至少86%。

Conclusion: 提出的TIL和AXELoss结合关键帧融合的方法有效解决了语音文本对齐问题，显著提升了语音识别性能并大幅减少了计算复杂度。

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对模型能力评估需求的增长，基准测试套件规模显著扩大，但缺乏能有效整合冗余减少和性能预测的系统性框架。

Method: 首先进行样本级冗余分析，识别并消除高度相似样本；将基准压缩构建为分数重构优化问题；提出EssenceBench框架，使用迭代遗传算法结合基于适应度的子集搜索和基于归因的样本搜索。

Result: 在HellaSwag基准测试（10K样本）上，使用25倍更少样本时所有模型排名变化在5%以内；使用200倍更少样本时达到95%排名保持率（变化在5%以内）。

Conclusion: 该方法相比先前方法在压缩效果、重构误差和效率方面表现更优，能有效压缩基准测试集同时保持模型排名准确性。

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Result: 系统实现了超过80%的语义可理解性，具有易学的学习曲线和普遍适应性。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效服务于教育程度有限的弱势群体。

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Method: 引入FML-bench基准测试，包含8个不同的基础机器学习研究问题，减少编码负担，强调基础问题而非特定用例，提供高任务多样性，并可扩展到真实世界的机器学习GitHub仓库。

Result: 评估了最先进的自动研究代理，发现采用广泛研究探索策略的代理优于专注于狭窄但深入探索的代理。

Conclusion: 强调探索的广度可能比仅关注增量改进带来更有效的研究成果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数字服务经济中受欢迎度的驱动因素，因为内容创作者经常误判观众真正重视的内容，而现有研究主要关注内容特征。

Method: 应用潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)模型分析大量TED演讲语料，将平台视为数字服务提供案例，比较创作者的主题供给与观众参与表达的需求。

Result: 识别出创作者供给与消费者偏好之间的持续不匹配，纵向分析显示时间动态比主题内容对消费者参与度影响更强。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了内容特征是受欢迎度主要驱动因素的假设，强调了时间和情境因素在塑造消费者响应中的重要性，为数字平台上的消费者注意力动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗订单提取对于结构化临床信息、支持决策制定和实现文档与工作流自动化等下游应用至关重要。该任务需要从多样化来源中提取结构化医疗订单。

Method: 使用通用指令调优的LLaMA-4 17B模型，不进行领域特定微调，仅通过单个上下文示例进行指导的少样本配置。

Result: 在17个参赛团队的105份提交中排名第5，平均F1得分为37.76，在原因和来源准确性方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型非领域特定LLM与有效的提示工程相结合，可以作为专门临床NLP任务的强大、可扩展基线。

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过后训练技术扩展扩散LLM上下文窗口的方法，无需从头训练。通过改进RoPE位置编码和优化掩码策略，实现了128K token的上下文窗口，在长上下文任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散LLM在长上下文行为方面的研究较少，现有方法需要从头训练，成本高昂。本文旨在探索高效的后训练技术来扩展扩散LLM的上下文窗口。

Method: 1. 改进标准RoPE位置编码以适应扩散过程的概率建模特性；2. 比较不同掩码策略对优化稳定性和长程记忆的影响；3. 提出UltraLLaDA模型，实现128K token上下文窗口。

Result: UltraLLaDA在长上下文任务中显著优于无需训练的基线方法，证明了所提位置编码扩展方法对扩散LLM扩展到长上下文的有效性。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置编码扩展是扩展扩散LLM上下文窗口的关键因素，为通过高效后训练实现128K规模上下文提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VOLTAGE的对比学习OCR方法，专门针对低资源语言，通过自动字形特征推荐和聚类标注来解决缺乏监督OCR方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球7000种语言中有2500种被列为濒危语言，语言消失会导致传统智慧、民间文学和社区本质的丧失。低资源语言面临更大灭绝风险，缺乏无监督OCR方法是阻碍其数字包容的原因之一。

Method: 使用对比学习OCR方法，结合自动字形特征推荐进行聚类标注，通过图像变换和生成对抗网络增强标注数据的多样性和数量。方法基于Takri文字设计。

Result: 在Takri文字上实现了95%的机器打印识别准确率和87%的手写样本识别准确率，并在其他印度文字上验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: VOLTAGE方法有效解决了低资源语言的OCR问题，通过基线研究和消融研究验证了方法的有效性，并构建了下游用例展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

TL;DR: AdvPrompt通过黑盒对抗提示减少大型推理模型的过度思考，显著降低响应长度同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂推理任务时会产生冗长的思考过程，导致计算开销和延迟增加，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出AdvPrompt迭代优化框架，从多角度生成高质量对抗提示，将开源和闭源模型都视为黑盒通信器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt显著减少token使用量：Qwen3模型在GSM8K上响应长度减少3倍，四个基准测试平均减少约40%token；Claude-3.7和Gemini-2.5在MATH-500上分别减少35%和47%token使用。

Conclusion: AdvPrompt展示了黑盒提示作为增强大型推理模型效率的实用有效策略，具有良好的跨模型规模和系列通用性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: AuthenHallu是首个完全基于真实LLM-人类对话构建的幻觉检测基准，揭示了真实使用场景中31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学等挑战性领域该比例高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准大多通过人工诱导或模拟交互构建，无法真实反映LLM在实际使用中的幻觉特征，需要基于真实LLM-人类对话的基准来弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 从真实的LLM-人类对话中筛选样本并进行标注，构建AuthenHallu基准，并探索使用普通LLM作为幻觉检测器的潜力。

Result: 统计显示31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学和数字问题等挑战性领域比例升至60%；普通LLM作为检测器虽有潜力但实际性能仍不足。

Conclusion: 基于真实对话的基准能更准确反映LLM幻觉特征，当前LLM作为幻觉检测器的能力仍需改进，AuthenHallu为未来研究提供了更真实的评估基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: BitMar是一个量化多模态transformer，使用1.58位编码器和外部情景记忆，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的图像-文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨注意力transformer和多模态视觉语言模型虽然擅长grounding和生成，但其全精度骨干网络难以在边缘设备上部署。内存增强架构很少与激进的边缘导向量化结合。

Method: 使用1.58位编码器（文本用BitNet风格，视觉用DiNOv2基础）创建紧凑嵌入，结合固定大小的键值情景记忆。BitNet解码器采用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制。

Result: 在质量和速度之间取得良好平衡，在低延迟和小模型占用下实现有竞争力的字幕生成和多模态理解。

Conclusion: BitMar的特性使其非常适合边缘部署。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

TL;DR: 提出基于时序大语言模型的动态主题演化建模框架，通过时间衰减函数和注意力机制捕捉主题变化，在潜在主题空间中使用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型难以有效捕捉主题在时间维度上的动态变化，需要一种能够统一建模语义表示和时间演化的方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制调整语义单元重要性，通过状态转移矩阵在潜在主题空间描述动态演化，采用联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉主题的生成、扩展和衰退过程，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本中的动态语义模式提供了系统解决方案，丰富了主题建模的研究范式，支持多领域的复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对校准数据如何影响压缩后LLM能力的探索不足，特别是在组合属性和领域对应性方面，需要更系统的研究来分析其对高级复杂推理能力的影响机制。

Method: 从激活模式角度分析校准数据的影响机制，探索其对数学问题解决和代码生成等高级推理能力的影响，并基于观察提出校准数据筛选框架。

Result: 研究发现激活空间中的代表性和多样性从根本上决定校准数据质量，提出的筛选框架能有效提升现有后训练压缩方法在保留关键LLM能力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据的质量对LLM压缩后能力保持至关重要，激活空间中的代表性和多样性是核心影响因素，基于此的筛选框架能显著改善压缩效果。

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注声明检测和验证，但缺乏对事实陈述背后认知结构和证据基础的细粒度分析。

Method: 构建手动标注数据集，包含事实陈述和来源提及的跨度级标注，以及来源类型、命名、角色、认知凭证等细粒度特征。使用2B-9B参数范围的编码器和生成解码器模型进行建模。

Result: 基于Gemma 2 9B的最佳模型实现了0.73的宏F1分数。

Conclusion: FactAppeal数据集和认知诉求识别任务为理解事实陈述的可信度建立提供了新视角，模型表现良好但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Motivation: 虽然媒体偏见被广泛研究，但事实报道背后的认知策略在计算层面尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用文章匹配策略比较相同事件的报道，应用FactAppeal框架分析47万篇文章，涵盖COVID-19大流行和以色列-哈马斯战争两个高度政治化时期。

Result: CNN的报道包含更多事实陈述并更可能基于外部来源，CNN引用专家和专家文件构建正式权威，福克斯新闻偏好新闻报道和直接引用。

Conclusion: 量化了党派媒体使用系统性不同的认知策略来构建现实，为媒体偏见研究增添了新维度。

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

TL;DR: AGENTIQL是一个基于智能体的多专家框架，通过问题分解、子查询生成和列选择优化等模块化步骤提升文本到SQL的生成性能，在Spider基准测试中达到86.07%的执行准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单体架构在处理复杂推理和多样化数据库模式时存在困难，需要更灵活和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 采用多专家框架，包括推理智能体进行问题分解、编码智能体生成子查询、优化步骤进行列选择，并引入自适应路由器在模块化流程和基线解析器之间进行选择。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，使用14B参数模型和Planner&Executor合并策略，达到86.07%的执行准确率，接近GPT-4的89.65% SOTA性能。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL提供了一个强大、可扩展且可解释的语义解析方法，通过暴露中间推理步骤提高了透明度，同时使用更小的开源LLM缩小了与GPT-4的性能差距。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: BrowserAgent是一个基于人类浏览行为的交互式网络代理，通过直接操作原始网页而非依赖工具转换静态文本，在开放问答任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Search-R1和WebDancer依赖额外工具将交互式网络环境转换为静态文本，这与人类多样化的浏览器交互行为（滚动、点击、输入）不符。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（监督微调和拒绝微调），通过预定义浏览器动作直接操作原始网页，并引入显式记忆机制存储关键结论。

Result: 使用更少训练数据的情况下，在HotpotQA、2Wiki和Bamboogle等多跳问答任务上比Search-R1提升约20%。

Conclusion: BrowserAgent可作为更先进、交互性和可扩展性更强的网络代理框架。

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Result: 仅使用1000个训练样本，在6种语言的3个数据集上表现出色，超越了使用更多数据训练的大模型，展现出强大的可解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard为解决LLM安全防护中的可解释性和多语言性能问题提供了有效方案，并贡献了多语言基准扩展和开源代码。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual
benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量预训练数据是大型语言模型的化石燃料，但前沿模型的数据储备正在枯竭，需要新的数据增强方法。

Method: 使用强化学习训练4B参数的重述模型，设计一个质量奖励和三个忠实度奖励，将有机数据转换为高质量重述同时保持核心语义和结构。

Result: 在22个下游任务上，RePro相比仅使用有机数据的基线获得4.7%-14.0%的相对准确率提升，数据效率提高2-3倍，优于基于提示的70B重述模型。

Conclusion: RePro为有效利用LLM预训练的化石燃料提供了一条高效且可控的路径，能够显著提升数据利用效率。

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at

Result: 模型性能与人类判断高度相关（准确率相关性0.71；F1相关性0.97），在明确陈述的方法学标准上达到接近人类准确率，但在复杂推理密集型评估中准确率显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs擅长识别明确方法学特征，但需要人类监督进行细致解释。自动化信息提取与针对性专家评审结合，可提高证据合成的效率和严谨性。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

*James Ald Teves,Ray Daniel Cal,Josh Magdiel Villaluz,Jean Malolos,Mico Magtira,Ramon Rodriguez,Mideth Abisado,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了HiligayNER，这是首个用于希利盖农语命名实体识别的公开基线模型，基于超过8000个标注句子构建，使用mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa模型微调，在各项指标上均超过80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希利盖农语作为菲律宾主要语言之一，在语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏标注语料库和基线模型，需要开发专门的语言技术工具。

Method: 从新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文学文本收集超过8000个标注句子，使用Transformer模型mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行微调，构建HiligayNER模型。

Result: 两个模型在所有实体类型上的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，与宿务语和他加禄语的跨语言评估显示出良好的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该工作为资源匮乏的菲律宾语言开发了首个希利盖农语NER基线模型，展示了在多语言NLP中的广泛应用潜力，支持区域语言处理的未来研究。

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

*Zhichao Wang,Cheng Wan,Dong Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统综述了推理时扩展技术，将这一新兴领域分为输出导向和输入导向两大类方法，重点关注如何在部署时通过额外计算提升LLM性能而无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练数据的快速减少已成为根本性瓶颈，研究重点正从模型规模扩展转向推理时扩展，旨在通过部署时的额外计算显著提升LLM在下游任务上的性能。

Method: 采用系统性综述方法，将推理时扩展技术组织为两个综合视角：输出导向方法（包括复杂多步生成策略、推理、搜索解码、长CoT训练和模型集成）和输入导向方法（主要包含少样本学习和RAG，其中RAG部分详细分析了查询扩展、数据、检索重排序、LLM生成方法和多模态RAG）。

Result: 构建了一个全面的推理时扩展技术分类框架，系统梳理了这一快速演进领域的关键技术和方法，为研究人员和实践者提供了清晰的技术路线图。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展代表了LLM发展的新范式，通过部署时的额外计算来克服训练数据瓶颈，输出导向和输入导向两大技术路径为提升模型性能提供了多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

### [88] [Toward Human-Centered Readability Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10801)
*Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于人机交互和健康传播研究的五维度评估框架HCRS，用于评估健康文本简化，超越传统表面指标，关注清晰度、可信度、语气、文化相关性和可操作性等人本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP评估指标（如BLEU、FKGL、SARI）主要捕捉表面特征，无法评估健康文本简化中人本质量，如清晰度、可信度、语气、文化相关性和可操作性，这在高风险健康环境中尤为关键。

Method: 提出人类中心可读性评分（HCRS），一个五维度评估框架，结合自动测量和结构化人类反馈，捕捉可读性的关系和情境方面，并集成到参与式评估工作流程中。

Result: 提出了HCRS框架及其验证协议，旨在使NLP系统更符合多样化用户的需求、期望和生活经验。

Conclusion: HCRS框架能够推进健康文本简化评估，超越表面指标，更好地满足用户需求。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自下而上方法，用于线性化树状结构知识，通过生成隐式聚合摘要，显著减少检索器中的文档数量，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理树状层次结构数据时，如何最佳表示检索知识以生成响应尚未充分探索，特别是对于GitHub仓库等结构化数据。

Method: 使用自下而上的方法线性化树状结构知识，在每个层次级别生成隐式聚合摘要，将知识存储在知识库中并与RAG直接使用。

Result: 与使用原始非结构化代码的RAG相比，响应质量相当，但检索器中的文档数量减少了68%以上，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识可能是处理复杂层次数据结构的高效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同音译方法对多语言NLP模型性能的影响，发现罗马化音译在大多数评估设置中表现最佳，主要是因为更长的共享子词标记能更好地利用预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同音译方法（共享脚本、重叠词汇、共享音系）对多语言模型性能的贡献程度，以弥合使用非拉丁文字语言之间的差距。

Method: 使用三种音译方法（罗马化、音位转录、替换密码）以及正字法进行受控实验，在命名实体识别和自然语言推理两个下游任务上评估每种模型。

Result: 罗马化音译在8个评估设置中的7个显著优于其他输入类型，与假设一致，即这是最有效的方法。

Conclusion: 罗马化音译是最有效的跨语言方法，更长的共享子词标记能更好地利用预训练模型，共享词汇对性能提升有重要贡献。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

### [91] [DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846)
*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DUAL-Bench，首个专注于视觉语言模型过度拒绝和安全完成的多模态基准，评估了18个VLMs在12个危险类别中的表现，发现现有模型在安全完成方面仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在安全性和实用性之间存在平衡问题，安全机制可能导致过度拒绝，特别是在视觉模态中，当指令无害但图像包含有害内容时，模型要么过于保守地拒绝，要么不安全地完成任务。

Method: 构建DUAL-Bench多模态基准，评估18个VLMs在12个危险类别中的表现，重点关注语义保持的视觉扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: 现有模型在安全完成方面表现不佳：GPT-5-Nano达到12.9%的安全完成率，GPT-5模型平均7.9%，Qwen模型仅3.9%。

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench将促进更精细的对齐策略发展，确保模型在复杂多模态环境中既安全又有用。

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时扩展策略在LLM解决方案中显示出潜力，但其在真实世界应用中的有效性，特别是与最新推理模型结合时，仍不确定。

Method: 在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上对6种轻量级、面向行业的测试时扩展策略和4个LLM（包括2个推理模型）进行基准测试，除标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和token消耗。

Result: 分治提示和小样本演示能持续提升通用型和推理型LLM的性能，但引入额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择对结果影响显著。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了在部署Text2SQL系统时，准确率、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前工作LLM x MapReduce-V2，旨在通过模块化分解实现更灵活的研究过程控制，支持人机交互干预，让用户对研究过程有更大控制权和定制能力。

Method: 使用多代理架构，将骨架初始化、摘要构建和骨架优化等功能组件实现为独立的MCP服务器，这些服务器可以聚合成更高层服务器。高层规划代理根据MCP工具描述和执行历史动态选择模块。

Result: 通过多轮交互，系统能精确捕捉研究视角生成全面骨架，进而发展为深度调研报告。人工评估显示系统在内容深度和长度方面均优于代表性基线方法。

Conclusion: MCP基础的模块化规划方法在生成长篇调研报告方面表现出色，分层模块化架构支持人机交互，提供了更好的过程控制和定制能力。

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言中表达置信度时经常表现出过度自信，但其原因尚不清楚，需要解决这一问题以提高透明度和可靠性

Method: 提出ADVICE（答案依赖的置信度估计）微调框架，促进基于答案的置信度估计

Result: 实验表明ADVICE显著改善了置信度校准，同时保持了任务性能，增强了答案基础性，产生了更平衡和良好校准的置信度分布

Conclusion: 研究揭示了过度自信的根源，并建立了更可信的置信度表达框架

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

TL;DR: 提出GapDNER模型，通过将实体片段间的上下文间隙作为额外跨度类型，使用网格标注方法解决不连续命名实体识别中的解码模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域中命名实体常由非相邻标记组成且相互重叠，现有方法在连接实体片段或内部标记时面临错误传播和解码模糊性问题

Method: 将上下文间隙作为额外跨度类型，转换为标记对网格标注任务，设计两个交互组件：内部跨度规律提取模块（双仿射机制+线性注意力）和跨跨度关系增强模块（交叉注意力）

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，GapDNER在不连续NER任务上达到了新的最先进性能，在识别复杂实体结构方面表现出显著优势

Conclusion: GapDNER通过建模上下文间隙有效解决了解码模糊性问题，显著提升了不连续命名实体识别的性能

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出评估AI系统对游戏评价能力的新范式，通过比较推理模型、语言模型和人类在100多个棋盘游戏上的评价表现，发现推理模型更接近人类判断，但存在非单调关系和资源使用不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估主要关注问题解决能力，而忽视了AI系统评估问题价值的能力。本文旨在建立评估AI系统评价游戏能力的新方法。

Method: 使用包含100多个新颖棋盘游戏和450多个人类判断的大规模数据集，比较现代语言和推理模型与人类及符号计算代理在评估游戏公平性和趣味性方面的表现。

Result: 推理模型在游戏评价上比非推理语言模型更接近人类判断，但随着模型接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度反而下降。评估趣味性时模型表现更不稳定，且推理模型在资源使用上表现出高度可变性。

Conclusion: 需要在语言和推理模型中注入更多资源理性的元推理能力，以改善模型在复杂评估任务中的表现和资源效率。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural

(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory

(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch

Motivation: 标准的二值化流程在头部选择前会丢弃标点符号，这会改变成分结构并损害头部-子节点识别。

Method: 开发了一个可复现的流程，在二值化前将标点符号保留为兄弟节点，并提供了衍生的人工制品、元数据和评估套件。

Result: 在Penn Treebank上，标点感知预处理将头部预测准确率从73.66%（Collins规则）和86.66%（MLP）提升到91.85%，并在CCGbank推导上实现了有竞争力的对齐。

Conclusion: 所有代码、配置文件和文档都已发布，支持在其他语料库上的复现和扩展。

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop
punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms
head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that

artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures,
alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering
head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility
with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware
preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules)

Motivation: 在线交流中毒性内容日益严重，但现有研究主要关注英语，低资源语言代表性不足，LLM难以识别和中和这些语言中的毒性表达，特别是当用户使用混淆技术规避检测时

Method: 基于韩语语言特征对混淆方法进行分类，定义基于真实案例的转换规则，构建三个难度级别（简单、普通、困难）的数据集版本

Result: 创建了首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，包含不同混淆难度的三个版本

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于更好地理解和缓解低资源语言LLM中的混淆毒性内容问题

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化构建虚假前提问题基准的流程，创建了JBA数据集，并开发了增强MLLMs识别虚假前提能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在虚假前提问题上表现脆弱，而现有基准测试缺乏细粒度分类和充分覆盖，无法严格评估模型识别虚假前提的能力。

Method: 开发了自动化构建虚假前提问题基准的流程，系统地将前提分为3个主要类型和13个子类型，并提出了增强模型识别虚假前提能力的框架。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在虚假前提识别方面仍有困难，但使用所提框架训练的模型在虚假前提识别方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的基准和增强框架有效提升了MLLMs识别虚假前提的能力，增强了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RV-HATE框架，通过强化学习优化多个专门模块的权重，针对不同仇恨言论数据集的特定特征进行检测，提高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在不同平台和来源的数据集中表现出多样性特征，但现有检测方法往往采用固定方法，未能适应数据集特定特征。

Method: RV-HATE框架包含多个专门模块，每个模块关注仇恨言论的不同语言或上下文特征，使用强化学习优化模块权重，并通过投票机制聚合模块输出。

Result: 该方法有效处理隐含仇恨言论，相比传统静态方法获得更优性能。

Conclusion: RV-HATE通过适应数据集特定特征提高了检测准确性，同时提供了对每个数据集独特特征的可解释性洞察。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,He Zhu,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了关键令牌微调(CFT)方法，只更新通过反事实扰动识别出的功能不可或缺的关键令牌，而不是像标准监督微调那样对所有令牌进行统一惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督微调(SFT)统一惩罚所有令牌，忽略了只有少量关键令牌决定推理正确性，这导致输出多样性减少和泛化能力有限。

Method: CFT方法通过反事实扰动识别功能不可或缺的关键令牌，只对这些决定性推理步骤进行梯度更新，同时保留非关键令牌的多样性。

Result: 在五个模型、三个模型家族和十一个数学推理基准测试中，CFT尽管只微调不到12%的令牌，但始终优于标准SFT。CFT还通过改进采样多样性实现测试时扩展，并为强化学习提供更强的初始化。

Conclusion: CFT是一个实用且通用的框架，用于高效和稳健的大语言模型微调，能够同时提升生成质量和多样性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，通过四阶段安全保障机制解决深度研究框架中存在的评估不足和阶段保护缺失问题，显著提升防御成功率并降低过度拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架缺乏充分的评估程序和阶段特定保护，通常只关注问答准确率而忽视报告质量的关键维度（可信度、连贯性、广度、深度、安全性），可能导致有害内容被整合到最终报告中。

Method: 开发了包含四阶段安全保障的DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，引入DRSAFEBENCH基准测试，在多个维度（防御成功率、过度拒绝率等）和五个关键报告维度上评估性能，测试了多种先进LLM模型。

Result: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD平均防御成功率提升18.16%，同时降低过度拒绝率6%。输入防护提供最显著的早期保护，计划和研究防护增强引用纪律和来源可信度。

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能够实现全面的开放领域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，同时系统性地提高报告质量而不过度拒绝。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究对6个大型语言模型在2820个招聘场景中进行审计，发现这些模型对残障人士存在显著的歧视性偏见，特别是当残障与性别、种姓等身份特征交叉时，偏见更加严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注西方背景，忽视了全球南方地区残障人士面临的交叉性边缘化问题（如性别和种姓），需要评估LLMs在招聘等高风险领域对残障人士的歧视问题。

Method: 引入ABLEIST框架，包含5个针对残障歧视和3个交叉性伤害指标，基于残疾研究文献，对6个LLMs在2820个涵盖不同残障、性别、国籍和种姓的招聘场景进行审计。

Result: 发现对残障候选人的ABLEIST伤害显著增加，许多最先进模型未能检测到这些伤害。性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人面临更严重的交叉性伤害（如象征主义）。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，需要在高风险领域（如招聘）对前沿模型进行交叉性安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

TL;DR: DND是一种动态嵌套深度方法，通过在Transformer层末端选择关键token进行额外处理来提升LLM性能，使用路由器和阈值控制实现精确选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高现成LLM的性能，通过选择性地对困难token进行额外处理，避免对简单token的冗余计算。

Method: 在Transformer层末端使用路由器识别关键token，将其反馈进行额外处理，采用路由器控制损失和阈值控制方案确保选择稳定性。

Result: 在预训练的密集和MoE模型上应用DND，Qwen3-1.7B性能提升1.88%，Qwen3-30B-A3B提升0.87%，参数和计算开销极小。

Conclusion: DND方法能有效提升LLM性能，通过动态选择关键token进行额外处理，在保持低开销的同时实现显著性能改进。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Motivation: 现有的联合逻辑-数值推理数据集依赖固定规则集，任务复杂度控制有限，限制了其在评估和训练中的通用性。

Method: 开发LogiNumSynth合成器，支持合成完全可控的联合推理任务，包括评估过程准确性和答案准确性，并使用合成数据进行针对性训练。

Result: 实验显示多个LLM在逻辑-数值推理方面存在持续弱点，LogiNumSynth可作为诊断工具和针对性监督来源。

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth能够有效提升语言模型的集成推理技能，既是诊断工具也是训练数据源。

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域具有应用潜力，但直接部署给患者存在安全风险，因为模型缺乏足够的领域专业知识。需要找到更安全的部署方式。

Method: 采用两阶段启发式反馈调查识别临床工作流需求，构建包含92,000个问答实例的DoctorFLAN中文医疗数据集，涵盖22个临床任务和27个专科。创建DoctorFLAN-test和DotaBench评估基准。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进以医生为中心的医疗LLM发展提供了有价值的资源和框架，证明了将LLM定位为临床助手的可行性。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型严格顺序解码导致的高延迟问题，以及现有并行生成方法存在的信息丢失和过早决策缺陷

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段将掩码位置保持为预测标记和掩码嵌入的分布混合，第二阶段逐步确定置信标记并保留不确定标记进行迭代反馈，使用KL散度动态作为收敛标准

Result: 在编程任务（HumanEval +6.3，MBPP +2.6）和推理任务（GSM8K +2.9，MATH500 +3.8）上准确率提升，同时实现最高10.6倍加速

Conclusion: LRD是并行序列生成的强大且通用的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升生成速度

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

Motivation: 现有LLM推理增强方法存在人类推理轨迹的训练偏差，依赖人类或高能力模型标注限制了探索替代性非人类推理路径，从而约束了可实现的性能。

Method: CGPO方法通过置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，在错误发生前的最低置信点提供指导，使用自生成的非人类推理路径进行偏好优化。

Result: 实验表明，在相同训练数据量下，使用小模型生成数据的CGPO方法在大多数情况下比使用强模型或人工标注数据的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: CGPO通过置信度引导的推理路径偏好优化，能够有效缓解轨迹漂移问题，提升模型推理性能，且不依赖人类或高能力模型的标注。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于距离的文本分类方法在处理多标签分类时面临阈值设定的挑战，特别是当文本实例可以有多个真实标签时。需要探索如何优化阈值设定来提升分类性能。

Method: 首先通过探索性研究验证文本与标签语义关系在不同模型、数据集和标签集中的变化，然后提出一种使用验证集优化标签特定阈值的新方法。

Conclusion: 基于距离的无监督文本分类方法具有快速推理和适应扩展标签集的优势，通过优化标签特定阈值可以显著提升多标签分类性能。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础的评估框架，用于评估视觉语言模型在胸部X光视觉问答中的思维链解释的忠实性，发现答案准确性与解释质量脱节，专有模型在归因和保真度方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的思维链解释往往听起来合理但未能反映实际决策过程，这在临床高风险应用中会削弱信任。现有评估很少捕捉到这种不一致性。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改，在三个维度上评估思维链忠实性：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准。进行了读者研究（n=4）来验证评估框架。

Result: 评估者与放射科医生的相关性在所有维度上都落在观察到的放射科医生间差异范围内。专有模型在归因（25.0% vs 1.4%）和保真度（36.1% vs 31.7%）方面优于开源模型。文本线索比视觉线索更能改变解释。

Conclusion: 答案准确性和解释质量是脱节的，仅凭最终答案准确性评估模型存在部署风险，需要超越最终答案准确性进行更全面的评估。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

TL;DR: RAGen是一个可扩展的模块化框架，用于生成领域特定的问答上下文三元组，以支持检索增强生成(RAG)系统的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统需要专门的、上下文丰富的训练数据来有效适应特定领域，而不仅仅是通用问答数据。

Method: 通过识别文档中的关键概念，基于布鲁姆分类学原则生成多样化问题，并从相关上下文中提取精确答案来生成问答上下文三元组。支持多种RAG适应策略，包括语义分块、层次概念提取和多块检索。

Result: RAGen能够高效处理大规模和不断演化的文档语料库，无需冗余处理，特别适合科学研究和企业知识库等动态领域。

Conclusion: RAGen为RAG系统的领域适应提供了一个可扩展且模块化的解决方案，能够生成高质量的领域特定训练数据，促进鲁棒推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

*Saad Obaid ul Islam,Anne Lauscher,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在简单问答中能正确回答事实问题，但在复杂查询中会给出不一致的答案，存在事实一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在简单和复杂查询中对同一事实问题的回答存在不一致性，这影响了模型的可信度，需要系统评估这种可靠性差距。

Method: 提出SLAQ评估框架，比较LLMs对同一事实问题在孤立短查询和复杂长查询中的回答一致性，测试了16个LLMs在600个查询上的表现。

Result: 发现短长查询回答存在系统性不一致，存在位置依赖的准确率损失和动量效应，机制分析显示对齐事实激活重叠的模型内部结构。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是LLMs可信度的重要方面，当前评估方法假设简单事实查询表现好意味着复杂任务可靠性的做法存在问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

TL;DR: WebRouter是一个基于信息论的查询特定路由器，通过成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，显著降低LLM驱动的网页代理的运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的网页代理面临成本与性能的权衡挑战，复杂的提示包含目标、行动历史和状态信息，导致LLM集成性能下降。

Method: 提出WebRouter，使用成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，学习输入提示的压缩表示，同时惩罚预期运营成本。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准的五个真实网站上的实验显示，WebRouter相比GPT-4o基线降低87.8%的运营成本，仅损失3.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: WebRouter有效解决了网页代理的成本性能权衡问题，在显著降低成本的同时保持了高准确率。

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了NLP中道德情感分类的公平性问题，特别是在跨域场景下。通过引入道德公平一致性(MFC)指标，揭示了传统聚合性能指标可能掩盖的公平性违规问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理中道德情感分类的公平性挑战，特别是在跨域转换场景下，传统性能指标可能掩盖模型在不同群体间的公平性差异。

Method: 使用Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus和Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus，在BERT和DistilBERT模型上进行多标签分类实验，采用域内和跨域协议评估，并引入MFC指标量化跨域稳定性。

Result: 发现Twitter->Reddit的跨域转移性能下降14.9%，而Reddit->Twitter仅下降1.5%。权威标签显示0.22-0.23的人口统计奇偶差异和0.40-0.41的均等机会差异。MFC与人口统计奇偶差异呈现完美负相关。

Conclusion: MFC作为补充性、诊断导向的公平性评估指标，能够更可靠地评估道德推理模型在异构语言环境中的部署效果。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

TL;DR: 本文重新评估语义解析器的评估方法，将图匹配与自动定理证明结合使用，发现基于图匹配的评估指标（如Smatch）不能充分反映逻辑等价性，并提出使用逻辑敏感的评估方法和简化的标准化目标表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图匹配评估指标（如Smatch）主要关注表面重叠而非逻辑等价性，这限制了语义解析器在推理导向应用中的评估准确性。

Method: 比较了两种构建解析器的方法：监督微调（T5-Small/Base）和少样本上下文学习（GPT-4o/4.1/5），在标准化和非标准化目标下进行评估，使用图匹配、双向蕴含和良构性作为评估指标。

Result: 在图匹配上表现良好的模型往往无法产生逻辑等价的公式。标准化减少了目标变异性，提高了良构性和逻辑充分性。错误分析显示性能随公式复杂度增加而下降，主要失败涉及变量绑定和索引以及谓词命名。

Conclusion: 图匹配指标在推理导向应用中存在局限性，需要逻辑敏感的评估和训练目标，以及简化的标准化目标表示。

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

practical value for depression risk identification and psychological analysis,
thereby providing insights to mental health applications tailored for

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XQuant是一个无需训练、即插即用的KV缓存量化框架，通过数据无关校准和跨层压缩技术，将KV缓存压缩到1.4比特以下，在保持模型精度的同时显著降低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长文本时KV缓存内存需求巨大，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。量化是减少内存消耗的有效方法，但现有方法在极低比特量化时性能下降明显。

Method: 提出XQuant框架，包含两个关键技术：计算量可忽略的数据无关校准方法，以及跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现亚1.4比特的KV缓存量化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和LongBench上的实验表明，XQuant优于KIVI-2bit和AsymKV-1.5bit等先进方法，在更低比特宽度下保持更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: XQuant在内存效率和模型精度之间建立了更好的平衡，为资源受限环境中的大语言模型部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御主要关注检测隐藏指令，但对基于内容操纵的攻击无效。AI代理需要能够批判性评估检索信息，验证声明可信度。

Method: 提出将自动事实核查任务重新用作AI代理的认知自我防御工具，通过外部证据验证声明并评估来源可信度。

Result: 论证了仅通过内容操纵（无需指令注入）即可有效攻击AI代理，现有防御机制对此类攻击无效。

Conclusion: AI代理需要发展批判性信息评估能力，自动事实核查可作为有效的防御机制来应对内容攻击。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

TL;DR: 研究发现，为人类设计的心理测量测试直接应用于大语言模型时，虽然显示出中等程度的可靠性，但在生态效度方面表现不佳，测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致甚至负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着心理测量测试越来越多地用于评估大语言模型的心理构念，需要系统评估这些原本为人类设计的测试在应用于LLMs时的可靠性和有效性。

Method: 系统评估了三种构念（性别歧视、种族歧视和道德）的人类心理测量测试在LLMs中的可靠性和有效性，包括收敛效度（理论基础的测试间相关性）和生态效度（测试分数与下游任务行为的对齐度）。

Result: 测试在多个项目和提示变体中显示出中等可靠性，但心理测量测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致，甚至在某些情况下呈负相关，表明生态效度较低。

Conclusion: 在解释心理测量测试分数之前，必须进行系统评估；为人类设计的心理测量测试不能直接应用于LLMs，需要进行适应性调整。

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖外部证据，在证据稀缺时泛化能力差，特别是在实时场景中新兴事件缺乏足够支持证据的情况下。

Method: 采用顺序评估机制，包含三个独立视角：基于证据的评估、基于推理的评估和基于情感的回退。通过指令调优和伪标签增强评估准确性，专家模块整合评估结果与新闻内容进行决策。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提高了对实时新闻的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EASE框架通过动态适应证据充分性，有效解决了实时假新闻检测中的证据稀缺问题，具有更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

TL;DR: 研究发现上下文学习(ICL)也会导致大语言模型出现广泛的对齐失效现象，即新兴错位(EM)，在64个狭窄上下文示例下错位响应率可达2%-17%，256个示例下可达58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明窄域微调会导致大语言模型广泛错位，但这种现象是否也存在于上下文学习中尚未探索。

Method: 使用三个前沿模型和三个数据集，通过提供不同数量的窄域上下文示例，并分析逐步推理过程来研究错位机制。

Result: 在64个窄域上下文示例下，模型产生广泛错位响应的比例为2%-17%；在256个示例下可达58%。67.5%的错位推理轨迹显示模型通过采用鲁莽或危险的"角色"来合理化有害输出。

Conclusion: 上下文学习确实会导致新兴错位现象，其机制与微调引起的错位相似，模型会通过角色扮演来合理化有害行为。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

### [128] [Template-Based Text-to-Image Alignment for Language Accessibility: A Study on Visualizing Text Simplifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11314)
*Belkiss Souayed,Sarah Ebling,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化视觉语言模型提示框架，用于从简化文本生成可访问图像，通过五种提示模板和专家评估验证了基本对象聚焦模板在语义对齐方面的最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智力障碍人士在理解复杂文本方面存在困难，现有文本到图像模型往往优先考虑美学而非可访问性，需要研究视觉插图与文本简化之间的关系。

Method: 设计了五种提示模板（基本对象聚焦、上下文场景、教育布局、多级细节、网格布局），使用400个句子级简化文本进行两阶段评估：第一阶段用CLIPScore评估提示模板有效性，第二阶段由四位可访问性专家对生成的图像进行人工标注。

Result: 基本对象聚焦提示模板实现了最高的语义对齐，表明视觉极简主义增强了语言可访问性；复古风格被评为最可访问的视觉风格，维基百科是最有效的数据源；文本简单性维度显示出强可靠性，而图像质量更具主观性。

Conclusion: 该框架为可访问内容生成提供了实用指南，并强调了结构化提示在AI生成视觉可访问性工具中的重要性。

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了LLMs中存在上下文无关的情感表达机制，识别了情感电路，并通过调控这些电路实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对大型语言模型情感智能需求的增长，需要理解情感表达的内部机制并控制生成文本中的情感。

Method: 构建SEV数据集，提取上下文无关情感方向，识别神经元和注意力头，通过分解和因果分析验证因果作用，整合局部组件为全局情感电路。

Result: 识别出情感电路，直接调控这些电路在测试集上达到99.65%的情感表达准确率，优于提示和引导方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统发现和验证LLMs中情感电路的研究，为可解释性和可控情感智能提供了新见解。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM特定效用的概念，发现人类标注的段落对LLM并非最优，且不同LLM之间的效用段落不可转移，强调了在RAG研究中采用LLM特定效用的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成(RAG)主要关注相关性，但RAG的有效性取决于检索段落的效用。现有研究将效用视为通用属性，忽略了不同LLM由于内部知识和理解能力差异，可能从同一段落中获益不同。

Method: 通过跨多个数据集和LLM的大规模实验，系统研究LLM特定效用概念，并提出基于困惑度的LLM特定效用评估基准程序。

Result: 实验表明人类标注的段落对LLM并非最优，真实效用段落在不同LLM间不可转移。基于伪答案的口头化方法表现稳健，但LLM在评估效用方面存在困难。

Conclusion: RAG研究必须考虑LLM特定效用，人类标注的段落不一定是特定LLM的真实效用段落，部分原因是查询和段落的可读性差异，其中困惑度是关键指标。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

TL;DR: 提出Rollout Routing Replay (R3)方法，通过记录推理阶段的路由分布并在训练时重放，解决MoE模型中路由机制导致的RL训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型中的路由机制在训练和推理阶段存在不一致性，导致RL训练不稳定甚至崩溃，需要解决这一基础性问题。

Method: R3方法记录推理引擎的路由分布，在训练阶段重放这些分布，减少训练-推理策略KL散度，缓解极端差异。

Result: 实验证明R3能有效稳定RL训练，防止崩溃，在多种设置下优于GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: R3为稳定MoE模型中的RL训练提供了新的解决方案，解决了路由不一致性问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在微调过程中的记忆问题，发现记忆现象在训练早期急剧增加，并提出基于n-gram的早期停止准则和损失正则化方法来有效缓解记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在许多任务中表现出色，但它们会记忆训练数据，从而暴露私有或受版权保护的文本。现有防御方法主要针对预训练阶段，而对微调过程中的记忆问题，特别是领域适应和指令微调中的记忆问题了解不足。

Method: 对Pythia、Llama3和Mistral模型（1.4B-70B参数）在常见评估数据集上进行微调，跟踪训练过程中的逐字记忆。使用简单的n-gram记忆评分作为早期停止准则，并引入n-gram感知的损失正则化器。

Result: 记忆在最初几个epoch中急剧增加，通常显著早于验证困惑度或评估性能的优化。n-gram记忆评分可靠地预测逐字记忆，作为早期停止准则可缓解记忆问题且性能损失最小。n-gram感知损失正则化器在所有测试模型家族中减少记忆达40%，与现有记忆缓解策略相比最小化评估性能权衡。

Conclusion: 这些结果为语言模型微调过程中的记忆动态提供了实用、可扩展的见解，提出的方法能有效缓解记忆问题并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个高质量的人类验证多模态狼人杀数据集，包含100+小时视频、3240万词元话语和15种规则变体，并开发了基于获胜阵营策略的策略对齐评估框架，用于细粒度评估模型的语言和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将社交推理游戏简化为LLM自博弈，产生模板化话语和轶事案例，忽视了社交游戏的丰富性；评估依赖粗粒度指标，缺乏质量参考数据。

Method: 构建高质量多模态狼人杀数据集，提出两阶段策略对齐评估：1)话语评估-多选任务评估模型在五个社交能力维度的立场选择；2)决策评估-评估投票选择和对手角色推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进LLM表现多样，约半数模型得分低于0.50，在欺骗和反事实推理方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估框架为多智能体交互中的语言、推理和策略研究提供了新基准，揭示了当前模型在社交推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

TL;DR: KnowRL框架通过自省和共识奖励机制，无需外部监督就能增强LLM的自我认知能力，显著提高模型对自身能力边界的判断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的LLM在超过20%的情况下会错误判断自身能力，导致基于这种内部不确定性的响应不可靠。需要让AI能够准确知道自己的知识边界。

Method: 结合两个组件：(1)自省：模型生成并分类判断可行/不可行的任务；(2)共识奖励：通过内部一致性来强化自我知识评估的稳定性。使用内部生成数据，避免昂贵的外部监督。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Qwen2.5-7B上的实验显示，KnowRL稳步提升了自我认知能力，准确率最高提升28%，F1分数提升12%，仅需少量种子集和无外部监督。

Conclusion: 该框架解锁了LLM自我提升知识意识的潜力，为构建更可靠、更负责任的AI以及在关键应用中更安全部署打开了大门。

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查成本高且耗时，LLMs被提议作为可扩展的低成本替代方案，但其输出存在偏差且估计无效，需要研究如何结合合成与去偏方法。

Method: 研究合成方法（用LLMs生成调查回复）与修正方法（去偏人口估计）的相互作用，探索人类回复在两者间的最佳分配策略。

Result: 单独使用合成方法引入24-86%的显著偏差，但结合修正方法后偏差降至5%以下，有效样本量提升高达14%。

Conclusion: 在固定预算下，将大部分人类回复分配给修正方法而非微调，能实现更有效的估计。

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

Motivation: 现实场景中实体类别持续增加，现有持续学习方法在NER任务中面临灾难性遗忘和非实体类型语义偏移的挑战。

Method: 将CNER任务转化为持续实体三元组序列生成问题，使用预训练seq2seq模型，结合类型特定置信度伪标注策略和知识蒸馏技术。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架在多种CNER设置下优于先前最先进方法，与非持续学习结果的差距最小。

Conclusion: GenCNER是一个简单有效的生成式框架，能有效缓解持续命名实体识别中的灾难性遗忘和语义偏移问题。

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

Motivation: 传统文本预处理方法通常忽略上下文信息，而大型语言模型能够考虑上下文且不需要大量语言特定的标注资源。

Method: 使用LLMs执行停用词去除、词形还原和词干提取等预处理任务，并在六种欧洲语言的文本分类任务上与传统算法进行对比评估。

Result: LLMs能够以97%、82%和74%的准确率分别复制传统停用词去除、词形还原和词干提取方法。使用LLMs预处理的文本训练的ML算法在F1分数上比传统技术提高了6%。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本预处理任务中表现出色，能够有效考虑上下文信息，在多种语言处理任务中优于传统方法。

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

Conclusion: 成功解决了幻觉检测中的关键差距，统一框架克服了信号稀缺和表示对齐障碍，实现了更全面的幻觉检测

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

Motivation: 为了捕捉词元间丰富的依赖关系，超越序列上下文建模的限制，提升词元级分类任务的性能。

Method: 构建基于PhoBERT词元嵌入的全连接图，使用GAT层捕获词元间依赖关系，再应用Transformer风格的自注意力层增强上下文表示，最后通过分类头进行序列标注。

Result: 在PhoNER-COVID19、PhoDisfluency和VietMed-NER三个越南语数据集上均优于transformer-only和混合神经网络模型等强基线。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语义特征与基于图的关系建模能有效提升跨多个领域的词元分类性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PART是一种保护推理轨迹免遭非法蒸馏的信息保留方法，通过移除自对话行为和重新排序子结论来破坏蒸馏效果，同时保持人类可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的详细推理轨迹虽然有助于用户理解和验证，但也容易被非法蒸馏。现有保护策略往往过度简化推理过程，剥夺了用户的中间信息。

Method: 设计了两步重构方法：移除自对话行为并重新排序子结论，使用小型辅助模型执行重构，计算开销最小。

Result: PART能持续破坏不同规模和类型学生模型的蒸馏效果。例如，在AIME 2024上，32B学生模型的性能从54.17降至46.88，下降13.5%。

Conclusion: PART在保持推理轨迹对人类可读的同时，有效防止了非法蒸馏，解决了保护与可用性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了全球语言在AI系统中的不平等现象，提出了连接语言活力与数字存在的理论框架，识别出四种语言类别，揭示了AI中的语言不平等是结构性而非偶然的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在大量多语言语料上训练，但全球7613种语言中约2000种语言（数百万使用者）在数字生态系统中几乎不可见，这种语言不平等需要从结构和权力角度解释。

Method: 提出连接语言活力（现实世界人口强度）和数字性（在线存在）的批判性框架，结合后殖民理论和认知不公正理论，分析所有记录的人类语言数据。

Result: 识别出四种语言类别：强权语言（33%）、数字回声（6%）、消逝之声（36%）和隐形巨人（27%），后者指数百万使用者但数字存在几乎为零的语言。这些模式反映了从殖民时代语言等级到当代AI发展的连续性。

Conclusion: 英语在AI中的主导地位不是技术必然，而是系统性排除边缘化语言知识的权力结构产物，需要去殖民化语言技术和民主化AI访问。

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

TL;DR: 提出了首个评估LLMs在现实多文化对话场景中的框架和基准，发现当前顶级LLMs在对话环境中的文化适应能力存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文化适应评估基准与LLMs在多元文化用户互动中面临的实际挑战不匹配，需要更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 基于社会文化理论构建框架，将语言风格作为文化沟通的关键要素，创建由多元文化评分者标注的基准数据集，并提出跨文化评估的三个期望标准。

Result: 评估显示当前顶级LLMs在对话环境中的文化适应能力表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的方法来评估和提高LLMs在多文化对话环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法无法生成可读解释且泛化性差，而LLM在文本理解、生成和推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索利用LLM改进知识图谱对抗攻击。

Method: 设计结构化提示方案将攻击建模为多选题，结合语义和中心性过滤器压缩候选集，通过预计算高阶邻接和三元组分类任务微调LLM来提升过滤性能。

Result: 在两个常用知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于最强黑盒基线，提供推理解释，并与白盒方法性能相当。

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持攻击效果的同时生成可读解释，验证了LLM在知识图谱对抗攻击中的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用多种方法生成封闭式调查响应，但缺乏标准实践，需要系统评估不同生成方法对预测调查响应的影响。

Method: 使用8种调查响应生成方法、4个政治态度调查和10个开源语言模型，生成了3200万个模拟调查响应进行系统比较。

Result: 不同调查响应生成方法在个体层面和子群体层面的对齐效果存在显著差异，限制性生成方法整体表现最佳。

Conclusion: 调查响应生成方法对模拟调查响应有显著影响，研究为应用这些方法提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA是一个两阶段优化框架，通过少量样本学习任务特定适配器，然后聚合多任务梯度来提升知识迁移，显著提高了多任务适应的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在单任务场景中很有效，但在多任务学习中难以有效利用任务间知识，通常需要大量任务特定数据才能达到最佳性能。

Method: 两阶段优化：第一阶段使用少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器；第二阶段通过聚合多任务梯度更新共享LoRA适配器，促进跨任务知识迁移。

Result: 在多任务学习和多语言学习场景中，该方法匹配或超越了传统全数据LoRA微调方法的性能，同时使用了显著更少的任务特定数据。

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA框架显著提高了多任务适应的数据效率，能够在减少数据使用的同时保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入方法通常产生单一维度的表示，无法捕捉科学文献中不同方面的语义信息，限制了细粒度分析和用户驱动的可视化能力。

Method: 采用无监督方法生成特定方面的摘要句子，训练嵌入模型将语义相关的摘要映射到嵌入空间相近位置，并通过蒸馏技术构建统一的嵌入模型，同时开发嵌入解码管道。

Result: 在入侵生物学和医学领域验证了框架有效性，能够生成多方面嵌入表示，支持可控的相似性评估和自适应可视化，解码机制显著提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi框架成功实现了科学摘要的多方面嵌入表示，为细粒度语义分析和用户驱动的科学领域可视化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了Transformer注意力机制，发现跨位置信息混合是必需的，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层中保留标准注意力时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的成功归功于注意力机制，但其核心设计原则的必要性尚未得到充分验证。本文旨在系统测试这些原则的重要性。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性放松注意力机制的不同原则，包括跨层统一应用和在混合架构中仅部分层保留标准注意力。

Result: 跨token混合机制不可或缺，其缺失会导致模型性能崩溃；而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是当仅在部分层中保留标准注意力时。令人惊讶的是，单独失败的变体在与标准注意力交错时也能获得稳健性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对注意力机制有效性的理解，为简化语言模型而不牺牲性能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于logit的知识蒸馏方法采用静态策略，与学生模型的动态学习过程不匹配，对所有token无差别处理并使用固定温度，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: AdaKD框架包含两个协同模块：1) LATF模块通过监控学生学习稳定性动态调整蒸馏焦点；2) IDTS模块对困难token使用低温进行针对性纠错，对简单token使用高温鼓励学习完整平滑的输出分布。

Result: AdaKD作为即插即用框架，在多种模型架构和基准测试中能持续提升各种蒸馏方法的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD通过动态适应token学习状态，解决了传统知识蒸馏方法的静态策略问题，实现了更优化的知识转移效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Conclusion: MPPA框架通过计划探索和聚合有效解决了长推理链中的计划错误问题，结合在线Step-DPO实现了高效训练和更高准确性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Conclusion: 当前LLM和智能体在超智能学术研究任务上存在能力差距，Acadreason基准凸显了这一挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and
highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然智能体强化学习已展示出提升LLM推理能力的效果，但其关键设计原则和最佳实践仍不明确，需要系统性的研究来揭示强化学习在智能体推理中的作用机制。

Method: 从数据、算法和推理模式三个维度进行系统性研究：使用真实端到端工具使用轨迹替代合成轨迹；采用探索友好的技术如clip higher、奖励塑形和保持策略熵；优化推理策略减少工具调用次数。

Result: 提出的简单实践方法能持续提升智能体推理能力和训练效率，在AIME2024/AIME2025、GPQA-Diamond和LiveCodeBench-v6等挑战性基准测试上取得强劲结果，4B模型可达到32B模型的性能水平。

Conclusion: 研究确立了智能体强化学习的实用基线，贡献了高质量的数据集，并证明了所提方法能有效提升LLM在复杂任务上的推理能力，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

*Tsung-Han Wu,Mihran Miroyan,David M. Chan,Trevor Darrell,Narges Norouzi,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了大型推理模型的"冻结世界"假设，评估了在中断和动态上下文两种现实场景下的模型鲁棒性，发现静态评估会高估模型性能，在动态环境中性能可能下降高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估假设模型响应是瞬时的且上下文不变，但在现代推理任务（如辅助编程）中，模型可能需要数小时思考，期间代码可能发生显著变化，"冻结世界"假设不再适用。

Method: 在数学和编程基准测试中评估LRM在两种动态场景下的表现：中断（测试有限预算下的部分输出质量）和动态上下文（测试模型对飞行中变化的适应能力）。

Result: 静态评估一致高估鲁棒性：即使在静态设置中表现优异的最先进LRM，在中断或暴露于变化上下文时也会不可预测地失败，当更新在推理过程后期引入时性能下降高达60%。

Conclusion: 揭示了新的失败模式，包括推理泄漏（中断时将推理折叠到最终答案中）、恐慌（时间压力下完全放弃推理返回错误答案）和自我怀疑（整合更新信息时性能下降）。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

TL;DR: 提出几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流，通过分离逻辑结构与语义来研究LLM是否内化了超越表面形式的逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何在表示空间中"思考"，探索LLM是否真正内化了逻辑推理能力，而不仅仅是表面形式的模仿。

Method: 使用几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流（嵌入轨迹），通过相同自然演绎命题但不同语义载体来分离逻辑与语义，利用位置、速度、曲率等几何量进行分析。

Result: 理论建立：1）LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流；2）逻辑语句作为这些流速度的局部控制器。通过表示代理设计实验可视化推理流。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为可解释性和形式分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了PULSE框架，用于更高效地评估人类与AI代理的交互，通过收集用户反馈、训练预测模型和结合人工评分与模型伪标签来计算结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的本质，需要更严谨的人类-代理交互评估方法。

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，包含用户反馈收集、用户满意度预测模型训练、人工评分与模型伪标签结合计算；在OpenHands开源软件代理平台上部署，收集超过15k用户的使用数据。

Result: 框架将置信区间减少40%；发现实际使用结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5对比结果呈负相关）；通过案例研究揭示了LLM骨干网络、规划策略和记忆机制对开发者满意度的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为人类参与的LLM代理评估提供了指导，识别了改进代理设计的机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

TL;DR: AETHER是一个轻量级框架，通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth的遥感表示与POI文本表示结合，增强城市功能和社会经济语义，在土地利用分类和社会经济映射方面显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遥感驱动地理空间基础模型主要编码物理和光谱模式，缺乏捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度的人类活动信息。

Method: 通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth遥感嵌入与POI文本表示相结合，使用轻量级框架丰富物理基础的遥感特征。

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1分数上相对提升7.2%，在社会经济映射的KL散度上相对减少23.6%。

Conclusion: AETHER通过耦合遥感和人类中心语义，推进地理空间基础模型向整合物理形式和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，当AI系统整合用户记忆时，会基于用户的社会经济背景产生系统性情感理解偏差，富裕用户获得更准确的情感解读，而个性化机制可能强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，了解这种记忆如何影响情感推理变得至关重要，特别是当AI记住用户背景信息时是否会产生不同的情感解读。

Method: 在15个大语言模型上评估人类验证的情感智力测试，使用相同的场景搭配不同的用户档案，分析模型的情感解读差异。

Result: 发现相同场景搭配不同用户档案会产生系统性不同的情感解读，多个高性能LLM中出现系统性偏见，优势用户档案获得更准确的情感解读，在情感理解和支持建议任务中存在显著的人口统计学差异。

Conclusion: 为个性化设计的AI系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，这是记忆增强AI面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、基于指令的干预方法，通过分步指令数据集和知识图谱验证，显著提升LLM在逻辑谬误分类中的表现和决策透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在严重的推理缺陷，包括幻觉倾向和逻辑谬误分类准确性差。这些问题源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。由于完整的系统2训练成本过高，需要探索低成本的干预方案。

Method: 创建了新颖的分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单的二元问题）。进一步通过咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱进行最终验证，形成基于规则的程序化干预。

Result: 该方法在LLM逻辑谬误分类方面取得了显著改进，同时提供了对LLM决策过程的增强透明度。

Conclusion: 这种程序化、基于规则的干预为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多轮LLM辩论分析道德推理中的价值对齐，发现不同模型在同步和轮询辩论格式下表现出显著行为差异，GPT强调个人自主权而Claude和Gemini更注重同理心对话，辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在复杂道德推理中的价值对齐至关重要，现有研究多基于单轮提示，不清楚这些发现在多轮对话环境中是否适用，需要研究多轮设置中通过对话、修正和共识形成的价值观。

Method: 使用LLM辩论方法，让GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型的子集在1000个Reddit日常困境中集体分配责任，采用同步（并行响应）和轮询（顺序响应）格式测试顺序效应和裁决修正。

Result: 发现显著行为差异：同步设置中GPT表现出强惯性（0.6-3.1%修正率），而Claude和Gemini更灵活（28-41%）；价值模式也不同，GPT强调个人自主权和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑同理心对话；辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响。

Conclusion: 辩论格式和模型特定行为塑造了多轮交互中的道德推理，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注针对简化RAG架构的白盒攻击，缺乏对更复杂现实场景（攻击者不了解系统内部细节，RAG系统包含多个组件）的研究。

Method: 提出RIPRAG攻击框架，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息，使用强化学习优化投毒文档生成模型。

Result: 该方法能有效攻击大多数复杂RAG系统，相比基线方法攻击成功率提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM工作流优化方法存在信息崩溃问题，将丰富的多步骤执行轨迹简化为简单的成功/失败信号，无法建模工作流的失败分布结构。

Method: 引入失败签名空间(FSS)概念，提出CE-Graph框架：从反例池近似失败分布，识别最密集区域作为重复失败模式，通过提议-验证机制应用有针对性的图编辑来贪婪减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性不是来自避免失败，而是来自系统性地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

Method: 使用有向、带符号、加权图表示信念，通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域并开发近线性算法构建紧凑图谱，引入冲击更新模拟信念变化。

Result: 在合成带符号图上进行实验，报告区域恢复、冲击下的稳定性以及运行时间，展示了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 为容忍矛盾的推理提供了原则性基础，能够在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑，实现局部有效推理。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys是一个受群体智能启发的分布式多智能体推理框架，通过探索者、工作者和验证者三个角色的迭代交互实现协调，在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体框架依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时程推理的可扩展性和适应性，需要更灵活、分布式的协调机制。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件配置文件、基于嵌入的概率匹配以及信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配和无全局监督的自组织收敛。

Result: 在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中，SwarmSys始终优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是构建可扩展、鲁棒和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展在推进LLM智能方面相媲美。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，从无标签的视听流中学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决说话人脸视频中面部动态与音频同步的问题，并学习可转移的面部表示，以支持多种下游任务。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，使用三个每帧提示令牌（身份、语音运动、环境运动）来编码说话人脸帧的关键因素，通过对比学习将音频和视觉模态对齐到共享嵌入空间。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务家族中实现了最先进的结果，包括视听流同步、面部表情和头部动作识别、视觉语音识别以及视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、因子化的自监督预训练在多种说话人脸相关任务中非常有效，SyncLipMAE框架为这些任务提供了统一的接口。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个端到端的智能框架，用于自动化IT系统故障排除指南(TSG)的执行，通过三阶段工作流提升TSG质量、提取结构化执行DAG并支持并行执行，显著提高执行成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障排除指南手动执行缓慢且易出错，现有LLM解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解释、数据密集型查询和执行并行化的专门支持。

Method: 三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具辅助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法且时间和token消耗更少，对可并行TSG实现32.9%到70.4%的执行时间减少。

Conclusion: StepFly框架有效解决了TSG自动化的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的事件管理提供了实用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DixitWorld评估套件，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，包含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态问答基准DixitBench。研究发现模型在生成创造性和判别理解之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单代理任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: 提出DixitWorld评估套件，包含：DixitArena（动态多代理环境，评估假设生成和选择）和DixitBench（静态QA基准，隔离听众任务）。

Result: 较小开源模型在创意线索生成方面表现更好，而较大专有模型在整体性能特别是作为听众时更优。DixitBench结果与DixitArena听众表现高度相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡和有能力视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

Motivation: 确保角色身份在不同提示下的一致性是基于扩散的文本到图像生成的基本限制。

Method: 在冻结的扩散骨干网络上构建，使用提示感知控制动态组合适配器进行推理，实现高效的角色定制。

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，CharCom显著提升了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间一致性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，并能以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成。

Conclusion: CharCom适合实际应用，如故事插图和动画制作。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

TL;DR: 提出PALU方法，通过性能感知长度更新实现简洁推理，在保持性能的同时减少65%输出长度，提升15%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性与性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应

Method: 将简洁推理建模为带约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似实现实用化：离策略性能估计、拉格朗日乘子截断、分位数驱动长度调整

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上，平均减少65%输出长度同时提升15%准确率，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够跨领域（逻辑、STEM、数学）和模型规模（1.5B、7B、14B）适应

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: SAFER是一个两阶段风险控制框架，用于在开放式问答中确保大语言模型输出的可信度，通过弃权感知采样和一致性过滤来提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一致性预测方法假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，这在缺乏固定有限解空间的开放式问答场景中是不现实的。

Method: SAFER包含两个阶段：1) 使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法在校准集上校准采样预算；2) 应用一致性风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤不可靠的候选答案。

Result: SAFER能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，并与各种任务特定的准入标准和校准-测试分割比率兼容，显示出其鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Conclusion: SAFER为开放式问答中的大语言模型部署提供了一个可靠的风险控制框架，解决了现有方法在无限解空间场景中的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Environment Tuning训练范式，通过结构化课程、环境增强和细粒度奖励，让LLM智能体直接从问题实例学习复杂行为，无需专家轨迹数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在复杂工具使用任务中高质量训练数据稀缺的问题，避免SFT的过拟合和标准RL的冷启动问题。

Method: Environment Tuning范式：包含结构化课程编排、提供纠正反馈的环境增强、确保稳定探索的细粒度进度奖励。

Result: 仅使用400个BFCL基准问题实例，就在分布内性能上达到竞争力，并在分布外泛化上表现优越，克服了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 实现了从基于静态轨迹的监督微调到动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

Motivation: 可靠的性能控制对于在网络上部署大型语言模型至关重要。现有激活引导方法依赖粗糙启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性考虑。

Method: 从双视图（尾平均和末端标记）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准，并使用轻量级位置扫描识别可接受注入位置。

Result: 在不同模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改进属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力。

Conclusion: PIXEL为LLMs的可控生成提供了一种实用且原则性的方法，支持可靠对齐。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决长推理模型在推理过程中因过度思考导致的计算成本增加和推理延迟问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）冷启动阶段使用监督微调构建混合推理数据集；2）强化学习阶段引入熵引导混合策略优化（EHPO），在高熵单元进行分支并采用难度感知惩罚来平衡快速和慢速推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ADR实现了推理性能与效率的有效平衡，性能提升高达6.1%，同时推理输出长度减少49.5%至59.3%。

Conclusion: ADR通过自适应双推理机制，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，为长推理模型的优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Method: 采用基于扰动的因果识别关键神经元方法，通过系统性地定位和破坏模型中的神经元来识别关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1)LLMs包含超稀疏关键神经元集合，破坏这些神经元会使720亿参数模型完全崩溃，困惑度增加20个数量级；(2)关键神经元非均匀分布，集中在外层MLP的down_proj组件；(3)性能退化呈现急剧相变而非渐进下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导，对LLM的鲁棒性和可解释性具有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的两步插件方法，通过识别感知和推理导向的注意力头并进行条件缩放，有效减少多模态大推理模型的幻觉问题，在多个模型和基准测试中平均提升5%性能，最高达15%。


<details>

Motivation: 多模态大推理模型存在幻觉问题，表现为错误的推理链和视觉内容误解。研究发现注意力头存在分层现象：浅层主要负责感知，深层转向符号推理，揭示了感知偏差和推理漂移是幻觉的两大原因。

Method: 提出功能性头识别和类条件缩放的两步插件方法：1)定位感知导向和推理导向的注意力头；2)在不重新训练的情况下调节这些头的贡献度。

Result: 在三个真实世界MLRM模型、六个基准测试和四个基线方法上的评估显示，该方法平均提升5%性能，最高达15%，仅增加<1%的计算开销和9%的基线延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现有多模态大推理模型的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

with a framework designed to navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer
support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 渐进投资包容性设计的组织能获得市场扩张和持续竞争优势，而将包容性视为成本的组织将面临网络效应和数据优势积累带来的复合劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

TL;DR: 该论文提出推理轨迹长度作为大型推理模型中简单有效的置信度估计器，发现推理后训练改变了轨迹长度与准确率的关系，且轨迹长度与口头置信度估计器表现相当但互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM的幻觉问题并提高其可靠部署，需要有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集和多提示的综合实验，研究推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器的性能，并分析其机制，包括调整问题难度和GRPO引起的长度偏差等混杂因素。

Result: 推理轨迹长度与口头置信度估计器表现相当但互补，推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，高熵或"分叉"标记在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理轨迹长度是大型推理模型中实用的置信度度量，推理后训练超越了口头表达的不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在建模患者轨迹方面具有通用性，但面临电子健康记录数据长且噪声多的问题，在时间推理方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用多代理系统，包括处理EHR数据的工作代理链，将关键事件提取到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理代理综合信息进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA优于四类基线方法。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA展现出临床对齐的时间推理能力，是建模复杂患者轨迹的稳健且通用性强的有前景方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

TL;DR: 提出Latent-Trajectory信号来预测推理轨迹的成功概率，通过分析模型内部表征的时间演化来指导推理过程，显著提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源来提升问题解决能力，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可以大幅减少浪费的计算并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理过程中内部表征的总体变化、中间步骤累积的变化以及这些变化向最终状态推进的程度来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层度量和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测解决方案准确性，在多个采样生成中指导答案选择，将token使用减少高达70%，同时平均准确率提高2.6%。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅为推理时间效率提供了实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入理解了推理过程在潜在空间中的表示和区分方式。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

TL;DR: ELAIPBench是一个由领域专家策划的基准测试，包含403个来自137篇AI研究论文的多选题，用于评估LLMs对学术论文的深度理解能力。实验显示最佳LLM准确率仅39.95%，远低于人类表现，且思维模式或RAG系统未能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLMs对完整学术论文的深度理解方面存在不足，要么问题设计肤浅，要么评估指标不可靠。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳LLM准确率仅39.95%，前沿LLMs配备思维模式或RAG系统未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直觉-方法分层模型与范围扩展的统一框架，通过直觉思维提供快速初步答案，方法思维将问题与解决方案解耦为可转移的推理单元，并引入垂直、水平、时间和空间扩展来增强LLM解决未见问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究已引入基于方法的推理和范围扩展来提升LLM性能，但缺乏系统整合。本文旨在将这些思想统一成一个更系统的框架，以更有效地解决间接（未见）问题。

Method: 构建直觉-方法分层模型：直觉层提供快速反应，方法层将问题解耦为可转移推理单元。引入四种范围扩展：垂直（因果分析）、水平（平行和泛化问题）、时间和空间扩展，并组织成系统化的知识树网络。

Result: 提出了方法扩展熵作为定量评估指标，衡量扩展的独立性和多样性，以此评估系统解决未见问题的能力。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑连接现有方法并引入新的扩展和基于熵的评估框架，这项工作推进了LLM在现实问题解决中更稳健和可扩展的推理范式。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于累积Jaccard指数的随机置换集距离测量方法，从随机有限集和可转移信念模型两个角度分析RPS距离，具有自然的高权重特性和更高的灵敏度与灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集(RPS)是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论的关键研究课题。现有方法存在不足，需要更有效的距离测量方法。

Method: 采用层-2信念结构解释RPS，将RPS理论视为可转移信念模型的细化。从置换出发引入累积Jaccard指数来量化两个置换的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS距离测量方法。

Result: 提出的方法具有自然的高权重特性：高排名元素间的不一致会导致更大的距离值。提供了两个参数供决策者调整权重和截断深度。实验结果表明该方法克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，且具有更高的灵敏度和灵活性。

Conclusion: 基于累积Jaccard指数的RPS距离测量方法在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能，为有序结构不确定信息的距离测量提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于梯度的优化器对硬件要求严格，需要高并发、高内存的GPU，且要求所有神经网络操作可微分，排除了许多有前景的不可微分架构的实际应用。

Method: 使用进化算法优化大语言模型，从预训练阶段开始训练10亿参数的LLM。

Result: 成功训练了10亿参数的LLM，并通过广泛实验提供了进化算法如何有效优化神经网络的关键见解。

Conclusion: 这项工作挑战了基于梯度优化是训练神经网络唯一可行方法的假设，有潜力显著降低大语言模型训练的计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有潜力

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Result: APLR模型提供了最佳拟合效果，通过数值和可视化解释识别出时间管理、专注力、帮助同学和线下课程参与是最重要的正面影响因素，而创意活动参与无显著影响。

Conclusion: 该模型可在个体层面解释影响因素，使教育者能够根据学生特征定制教学指导。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Motivation: 现有方法存在数据效率低、过度简化现实动态、难以实施操作约束等问题，需要一种能更好平衡动态空间异质供需的方法。

Method: 构建动态分层系统，使用LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，指导底层优化器执行约束和实时决策，通过和谐搜索进行闭环进化优化。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，结合了LLM的认知能力和数学优化的约束执行能力。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来优化信用分配，解决RLVR中均匀优势信号导致的探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO在序列中广播均匀优势信号，忽略了推理过程中不确定的高风险决策的关键作用，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS是一个无模型方法，分两阶段操作：首先使用模型的整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用标记级惩罚。这种双重机制鼓励探索产生正确答案的高不确定性路径，同时惩罚过度自信但错误的推理。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UCAS在包括1.5B和7B在内的多个模型规模上显著优于强RLVR基线。

Conclusion: UCAS不仅实现了更高的奖励，还促进了更大的推理多样性，并成功缓解了熵崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniVideoBench是一个大规模视频理解基准测试，专门评估多模态大语言模型在音频和视觉协同推理方面的能力，包含1000个高质量问答对和13种问题类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估音频和视觉模态的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个高质量问答对的基准测试，这些问答对来自628个多样化视频，每个都带有逐步推理轨迹，并手动验证确保正确性和唯一性。

Result: 评估显示多模态大语言模型在音频-视觉推理方面存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型，突显了真正音频-视觉推理的内在难度。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将促进开发具有更强、更泛化推理能力的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了扩展三角方法(ETM)，作为矛盾分离扩展(CSE)框架的算法实现，统一了多种矛盾构建策略，在标准一阶基准测试中表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制在多子句间的推理协同。矛盾分离扩展框架重新定义了逻辑推理为矛盾分离过程，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: 扩展三角方法(ETM)形式化并扩展了矛盾分离的内部机制，在三角几何框架中统一了多种矛盾构建策略，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器(CSE、CSE-E、CSI-E、CSI-Enig)的核心算法，在标准一阶基准测试(TPTP问题集和CASC 2018-2015)中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM通过连接理论抽象和操作实现，将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力，通过为不同问题选择最合适的符号语言形式化方法，显著提高了推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题转换为符号语言时，只关注语义相似度，忽略了不同符号语言类型本身对特定逻辑推理问题的适用性差异。不同符号语言擅长处理不同类型的逻辑问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型自适应选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题翻译到目标符号语言，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于单一符号语言翻译和随机选择。在混合数据集上达到96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提升了25%。

Conclusion: 为不同逻辑推理问题选择最合适的符号语言形式化方法是提升大语言模型逻辑推理性能的关键因素，自适应选择策略能显著提高推理准确率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个框架来评估大型语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过分析信念形成、行动评估和选择过程，发现前沿模型在特定推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并展现出元推理和新型启发式规则形成的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但缺乏对其真正战略思维能力（包括信念形成、行动评估和基于信念的选择）的系统性研究。

Method: 开发了一个框架来分离信念、评估和选择过程，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入新的无上下文游戏来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在目标推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束时会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化猜想；在复杂性增加时，显式递归让位于内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新型启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为子组件来改进自动形式化，显著提升了前提检索效果和在定理证明中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于检索的自动形式化方法直接使用非正式陈述查询外部库，但忽略了非正式数学陈述往往复杂且缺乏底层数学概念上下文的问题。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，让LLMs将非正式数学陈述分解为更易处理的子组件，从数学库中针对性检索前提，并检索示例定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致改进前提检索，ProofNet上F1分数比DPR基线几乎翻倍，在分布外ConNF基准上表现强劲，GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1分别提升37.14%和42.25%。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖于模型特定的知识边界，需要与每个模型能力相适应的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为模式，这些行为虽然内部一致但与现实环境不匹配，源于AI系统中规划、不确定性处理和记忆机制的复杂交互作用。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别和分类神经症行为模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用的逃逸策略，使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试以最大化神经症评分。

Result: 识别了12种神经症行为模式，开发了有效的检测和逃逸机制，展示了厌恶学习如何导致持久的行为偏差，即使环境完全安全。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足以解决全局性故障，需要通过破坏性测试和对抗性课程来暴露需要架构级修订的根本问题，而不仅仅是症状层面的修补。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升性能，但泛化性和适应性差，需要昂贵的重训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将上行传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，采用LLM驱动的智能体通过近端策略优化协调，使用协议动作语法确保过程可靠高效。

Result: 仿真验证该框架比传统基线方法吞吐量提升77.6%，公平性提升65.2%，且能很好地泛化到用户数量波动的情况而无需重训练。

Conclusion: 该LLM赋能的博弈论多智能体强化学习框架能够自适应生成语义MAC协议，在动态环境中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要局限于单篇论文内的无工具任务，缺乏针对真实研究场景中跨论文推理和多工具协调的基准测试。

Method: 构建了模块化可扩展平台，提供多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，用于标准化评估代理在整合多篇论文信息时的表现。

Result: 最先进的LLM代理系统平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上更是降至18.47%，且所有测试代理都表现出工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前科学文献理解代理的重大局限性，为开发更强大的科学发现代理提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

TL;DR: 提出Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架，解决RAG代理中的工具调用黑客问题，通过证据基础的强化学习确保检索证据与答案之间的因果联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别了RAG代理中先前被忽视的失败模式——工具调用黑客，即代理通过发出表面正确的工具调用来夸大奖励信号，而不真正利用检索到的证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假基础。

Method: 提出Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架，通过统一的逐步合约结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，强制验证检索证据、推理轨迹和最终答案之间的因果联系。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面始终优于强大的DeepResearch基线，涵盖领域内、领域外和工具分布外设置。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不仅需要将RL训练的代理基于任务结果，还需要基于检索信息的因果使用，为实现可信的检索增强推理提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架通过图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化，为企业智能知识助手提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图基强化学习和专门数据集，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在精确时空推理方面的能力，为下游应用提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 在制造系统中，识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要。基于知识的故障原因推断需要知识库明确结构化系统知识和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建了诊断知识本体，提出了基于功能-行为-结构(FBS)模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家枚举的候选原因集有更好的一致性，特别是在相关案例少、词汇差异大的困难情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法利用设计阶段对目标系统的理解和知识，支持维护阶段的知识积累和问题解决，有望成为未来整个工程链知识共享的基础。未来需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法，构建用户界面，并在更大更多样化的系统上进行验证。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性（黑箱问题）对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，需要开发符合法律要求的可解释方法。

Method: 分析不同可解释AI方法的优缺点，重点研究计算论证框架如何捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性特征。

Result: 论证框架为可解释法律AI提供了特别稳健的基础，能够满足法律推理的技术和规范性透明要求。

Conclusion: 计算论证方法最有潜力满足法律领域的技术和规范透明要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动、人机协作的自动化可解释数据分析框架，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成可执行代码并验证计算，实现透明文档化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而缺乏透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: ARIA集成六个互操作层（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），采用文档中心化工作流统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范自主生成代码并验证计算。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于最先进系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可重复的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI智能体在面对规划问题时如何有效提问和利用答案来减少不确定性，填补知识空白，支持高效规划。

Method: 引入How2记忆智能体框架，在Plancraft Minecraft环境中评估，使用不同抽象层次的教师模型回答问题，从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习智能体从抽象且与当前状态解耦的答案中获益最大，How2框架使基于LLM的智能体能够在交互环境中通过提问提升规划能力。

Conclusion: How2框架为LLM智能体提供了一种通过提问和终身学习来持续改进规划能力的方法，抽象回答对规划效率有显著提升。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CDRA方法，将LLM对齐从标量奖励匹配重构为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深度偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法推断用户的深度隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），且缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力，导致响应肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1）引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好查询对，涵盖20个主题）；2）提出Pers-GenPRM模型，将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务；3）通过批判驱动的策略对齐进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验表明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现优异，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的认知差距问题，实现了更好的用户偏好推断和防御性推理能力。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于每种AI对齐技术都存在失效模式，防御纵深策略被提出作为风险缓解方法。但该策略的成功取决于不同对齐技术失效模式之间的相关性程度。

Method: 通过分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种失效模式，研究它们之间的重叠程度和相关性。

Result: 研究发现不同对齐技术的失效模式存在不同程度的重叠，这影响了防御纵深策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 防御纵深策略的有效性取决于失效模式的相关性，研究结果为理解当前风险水平和未来AI对齐研究优先级提供了重要见解。

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

TL;DR: PADME是一个智能代理框架，通过将自然语言程序文本转换为可执行图结构，解决长时程程序执行中的漂移和失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令（如食谱、科学协议）包含丰富的过程知识，但其多变性和缺乏结构导致基于大语言模型的代理在执行过程中容易漂移或失败。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本系统结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行。构建图结构表示任务依赖关系、决策点和可重用子程序。

Result: 在四个多样化基准测试（包括ALFWorld和ScienceWorld）上达到最先进性能，证明基于图的程序表示为稳健和可泛化执行提供了强大的中间抽象。

Conclusion: 结构化程序建模对于可靠的代理驱动自动化至关重要，图表示提供了减少长时程推理中错误累积的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型多步推理能力训练方法存在缺陷：结果监督强化学习只奖励正确答案但传播错误推理，过程级奖励模型缺乏泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 提出DRM框架，从三个维度评估推理过程：置信度（不确定性校准）、相关性（语义对齐）、连贯性（逻辑一致性），无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验表明DRM提供有效的监督信号，指导LLM优化并提升推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外任务均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLM在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管演绎和溯因推理在知识图谱分析中具有协同潜力（演绎验证假设，溯因发现深层逻辑模式），但现有方法将它们孤立处理。

Method: 提出DARK框架，包含两个关键创新：1）自反思去噪过程，在溯因推理中迭代生成并验证候选假设；2）逻辑探索强化学习方法，同时掩码查询和结论，探索新的推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 统一方法在知识图谱推理中具有显著优势，DARK框架成功实现了演绎和溯因推理的协同效应。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着企业AI助手的兴起，保护私人数据和确保合规性成为优先事项，特别是在医疗和金融等敏感行业。

Method: 研究分析了Salesforce AgentForce和Microsoft Copilot等领先AI助手的技术架构，以及OpenAI、Anthropic和Meta等大型语言模型服务提供商的零数据保留政策实施。

Result: 定义了支持零数据保留系统的架构、合规性和可用性之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 零数据保留政策对于企业AI助手的数据治理和隐私保护至关重要，需要平衡技术架构与合规要求。

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM智能体系统中政策文档内部化问题，通过可控复杂度评估和政策分类持续预训练，显著减少提示长度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体系统依赖政策文档，但随着需求增长文档快速扩张导致计算开销大，需要将政策文档嵌入模型先验中同时保持性能。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器控制四个复杂度级别，提出CAP-CPT方法自动解析政策文档分类为事实性、行为性和条件性三类，通过目标数据合成和自回归预训练损失实现政策内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置下都优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，在tau-Bench上仅需少量SFT数据即可增强性能。

Conclusion: 复杂政策规范对推理构成主要挑战，CAP-CPT通过分类感知的持续预训练有效减轻数据和推理负担，显著提升政策内部化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI研究缺乏严格的可复现性标准导致政策制定者难以制定有效治理机制，论文建议通过预注册、提高统计能力和发表阴性结果等可复现性协议来改善AI治理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究的信息环境信噪比过低，存在监管俘获风险，政策制定者在确定优先治理风险时面临深度不确定性和分歧

Method: 借鉴其他科学领域的可复现性危机经验，提出在AI研究中采用预注册、提高统计能力和发表阴性结果等可复现性协议

Result: 分析了AI研究即将面临的可复现性危机，并提出了具体的可复现性改进方案

Conclusion: 虽然AI治理必须保持反应性，但政策制定者应将可复现性协议视为治理工具箱的核心工具，并要求AI研究达到更高标准

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三组件框架，结合可解释AI、生存分析和RFM分析，用于客户流失预测和个性化保留策略设计，而不仅仅是预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线零售中获客成本高于客户保留成本，但现有流失模型多为黑箱，限制了洞察流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户识别的能力。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失时间风险、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 该框架能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、优先处理目标细分市场，从而支持减少流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略。

Conclusion: 应从单纯预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略设计，该框架为此提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

TL;DR: ParaCook是一个用于评估多智能体时间效率协作规划的基准，基于简化版Overcooked游戏，专注于并行和异步操作的规划效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体基准主要关注任务完成度，但忽视了并行和异步操作中的时间效率问题，需要专门评估多智能体系统在时间效率方面的规划能力。

Method: 基于Overcooked游戏设计ParaCook环境，提供简化的动作空间来专注于并行战略规划的核心挑战，建立可扩展的评估框架。

Result: 对最先进LLM的评估显示，当前方法生成次优计划，在并行动作和协调方面表现不佳，但在抽象任务中显示出并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook为开发和评估时间效率感知的多智能体规划奠定了基础，揭示了LLM在并行规划方面的局限性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Method: 将代码解释器封装为数据分析和方程评估工具集，让智能体在最小人工干预下使用这些工具进行长期优化，并开发端到端强化学习框架增强智能体能力。

Result: 在四个科学领域的数据集上，SR-Scientist比基线方法绝对提升6%到35%，表现出对噪声的鲁棒性、外泛化能力和符号准确性。

Conclusion: SR-Scientist成功将LLM转变为自主AI科学家，显著提升了方程发现性能，展示了在科学发现任务中赋予LLM更全面角色的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate
of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance

environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under
identical constraints.

Conclusion: 宪法AI训练结合领域特定原则的方法为心理健康应用提供了更有效的AI安全保障，解决了通用安全措施在心理健康领域的局限性。

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health
applications.

Motivation: 研究在外部环境（如外生冲击或政策约束）和基于交互属性的内部微观动机下的激励相容同质性。

Method: 提出一组捕捉同质性主要特征的不变量，以及导致完美全局同质性的明确定义的分区动态。通过同构刻画同质性形成标准。

Result: 展示了宏观互补性与微观替代性的出现，其中局部个体的效用函数是非线性和次模的。讨论了两种金融网络及其差异：层级结构源于短期流动性交易，而核心-边缘结构基于存量视角。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究激励相容同质性提供了理论基础，揭示了不同金融网络结构形成的机制差异。

Abstract: This paper introduces a tractable model to study incentive-compatible
homophily under both external environments--such as exogenous shocks or policy
constraints--and internal micromotives based on interactive attributes. We
propose a set of invariants that capture main features of homophily and the
well-defined partition dynamics leading to perfect global homophily. The
criteria for homophily formation are characterized via isomorphism. Within this
framework, we demonstrate the emergence of macro-complementarity coupled with
micro-substitution, where local individuals' utility function is nonlinear and
submodular. We discuss two types of financial networks and their differences:
hierarchical structure emerges from short-term liquidity transactions, whereas
core-periphery structure is based on a stock-based perspective.

TL;DR: 该论文研究动态网络形成博弈，发现当参与者对网络子结构（motifs）的估值相等时，博弈成为势博弈，具有闭式平稳分布；当估值限于有限重复子结构时，模型会出现相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态网络形成博弈中，参与者对网络结构赋予任意价值时的均衡行为，探索局部估值如何影响网络形成过程。

Method: 通过将博弈表示为参与者对网络子结构的价值评估，分析局部估值与均衡行为的关系，特别关注势博弈条件和有限重复子结构的情况。

Result: 发现当所有参与者对同一子结构估值相等时，博弈成为势博弈，可获得闭式平稳分布；在有限重复子结构条件下，模型展现出相变特性，即微小估值变化会导致网络密度的不连续跳跃。

Conclusion: 网络形成博弈的均衡行为与参与者对子结构的估值密切相关，势博弈条件和相变现象为理解网络动态提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: I study dynamic network formation games in which agents assign arbitrary
values to network structures. Any such game admits an equivalent representation
in terms of the values agents assign to its sub-structures, linking local
valuations to equilibrium behavior. The game is a potential game precisely when
all participants in a structure value it equally, yielding a closed-form
stationary distribution. When valuations are restricted to a finite set of
repeated sub-structures, or motifs, the model exhibits phase transitions: small
changes in motif values cause discontinuous shifts in network density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于工作不安全感的研究主要局限于非系统性维度，而该变量在宏观经济背景下具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一个小规模理性预期新凯恩斯模型，其中有限信息的家庭和企业从完全知情的政府和央行接收关于不可观测变量的潜在噪声信息信号。

Result: 研究发现，即使满足泰勒原则，如果公共代理人将所有可用信息无沟通模糊地传递给私人代理人，模型允许存在唯一稳定的均衡路径，其中可能出现'透明度悖论'。否则，模型动态在均衡存在性和多重性方面变得不可预测，工作不安全感在均衡确定性中可能发挥根本作用。

Conclusion: 讨论了适当的政策建议，强调了信息透明度和沟通策略在管理工作不安全感和宏观经济稳定中的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the importance of this variable in the macroeconomic context, current
research on job insecurity remains mainly confined to its non-systemic
dimension. The research aim of this paper is to identify the short-run and
long-run macroeconomic determinants of job insecurity in the presence of
asymmetric information between public and private agents, informative shocks,
and different degrees of institutional communication transparency. To
accomplish this goal, a small-scale, rational expectations, New Keynesian model
is proposed in which limitedly informed households and firms receive a
potentially noisy informative signal about the unobservables from fully
informed government and central bank. It is found that, notwithstanding the
fulfillment of the Taylor principle, if public agents transfer all the
available information to the private agents without communication ambiguities,
the model admits a unique, stable equilibrium path along which the 'Paradox of
Transparency' can emerge. Otherwise, the model's dynamics become unpredictable
in terms of equilibrium existence and multiplicity, and job insecurity plays a
potentially fundamental role in equilibrium determinacy. Appropriate policy
recommendations are discussed.

Motivation: 研究在具有网络溢出效应的多战场冲突中，玩家如何分配资源以及网络结构如何影响冲突结果。考虑现实世界中资源分配往往具有溢出效应，一个战场的投入会影响邻近战场的胜负。

Method: 建立双玩家多战场冲突模型，每个玩家有自己的网络结构，资源分配具有网络溢出效应。分析均衡存在性和唯一性，研究网络设计问题，分析玩家同时选择网络和努力分配的博弈。

Result: 存在唯一均衡，玩家赢得战场的相对概率等于两个网络战场中心性比率乘以玩家相对努力成本比率。识别了最大化总努力和总效用的网络结构。

Conclusion: 网络结构在具有溢出效应的多战场冲突中起关键作用，战场中心性和相对成本共同决定胜负概率。网络设计可以优化总体努力和效用，玩家在同时选择网络和努力时存在特定均衡。

Abstract: We study a two-player model of conflict with multiple battlefields -- the
novel element is that each of the players has their own network of spillovers
so that resources allocated to one battle can be utilized in winning
neighboring battles. There exists a unique equilibrium in which the relative
probability of a player winning a battle is the product of the ratio of the
centrality of the battlefield in the two respective competing networks and the
ratio of the relative cost of efforts of the two players. We study the design
of networks and characterize networks that maximize total efforts and maximize
total utility. Finally, we characterize the equilibrium of a game in which
players choose both networks and efforts in the battles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GitHub Copilot引入后对开源软件项目代码质量和维护挑战的影响，特别是关注生产力提升是否以代码质量下降为代价。

Method: 分析GitHub Copilot引入后开源软件项目中开发者的活动数据，比较不同经验水平开发者的生产力变化和代码审查工作量。

Result: 生产力确实提高，但主要由经验较少的开发者驱动；AI生成的代码需要更多返工；核心开发者代码审查量增加6.5%，但原始代码生产力下降19%。

Conclusion: AI带来的生产力收益可能掩盖了维护负担向专家群体集中的风险，需要谨慎对待这种生产力提升的可持续性。

Abstract: Generative AI solutions like GitHub Copilot have been shown to increase the
productivity of software developers. Yet prior work remains unclear on the
quality of code produced and the challenges of maintaining it in software
projects. If quality declines as volume grows, experienced developers face
increased workloads reviewing and reworking code from less-experienced
contributors. We analyze developer activity in Open Source Software (OSS)
projects following the introduction of GitHub Copilot. We find that
productivity indeed increases. However, the increase in productivity is
primarily driven by less-experienced (peripheral) developers. We also find that
code written after the adoption of AI requires more rework. Importantly, the
added rework burden falls on the more experienced (core) developers, who review
6.5% more code after Copilot's introduction, but show a 19% drop in their
original code productivity. More broadly, this finding raises caution that
productivity gains of AI may mask the growing burden of maintenance on a
shrinking pool of experts.

Motivation: 衡量和比较各国创新绩效存在方法论挑战，需要开发新的方法来分析伊朗的创新趋势及其与地区同行的比较。

Method: 使用季节性趋势分解与快速动态时间规整相结合的时间序列相似性方法，以研发支出占GDP比例为代理指标，采用自编码器插补技术处理缺失值。

Result: 贫困和健康指标与伊朗研发支出表现出最强的统计相似性，沙特阿拉伯、阿曼和科威特显示出最高的跨国相似度。

Conclusion: 伊朗创新与社会发展动态的内在联系更强，而非传统经济或基础设施驱动因素，这对科技创新政策具有特定区域意义。

Abstract: Innovation is becoming ever more pivotal to national development strategies
but measuring and comparing innovation performance across nations is still a
methodological challenges. This research devises a new time-series similarity
method that integrates Seasonal-Trend decomposition (STL) with Fast Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) to examine Irans innovation trends by comparison with its
regional peers. Owing to data availability constraints of Global Innovation
Index data , research and development spending as a proportion of GDP is used
as a proxy with its limitations clearly noted. Based on World Bank indicators
and an Autoencoder based imputation technique for missing values, the research
compares cross-country similarities and determines theme domains best aligned
with Irans innovation path. Findings indicate that poverty and health metrics
manifest the strongest statistical similarity with R and D spending in Iran,
while Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait show the most similar cross country
proximity. Implications are that Iranian innovation is more intrinsically
connected with social development dynamics rather than conventional economic or
infrastructure drivers, with region-specific implications for STI policy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨继承权改革对印度女性赋权的影响，特别是在婚姻选择、家庭暴力、自主权等方面的变化。

Method: 采用准自然实验框架和双重差分策略，利用印度人类发展调查数据，分析五个州在联邦法律修订前先行修订继承法的影响。

Result: 继承法修订对婚姻选择、亲密伴侣暴力、身体和公民自主权有积极影响，但对家庭自主权有负面影响，对经济参与无显著影响。影响在不同社会经济群体中存在异质性。

Conclusion: 继承法改革的影响并非在所有群体中一致，需要针对不同群体的具体情况制定政策。

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of inheritance rights on women' empowerment
in India. We employ the quasi-natural experiment framework wherein; five states
amended the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) from 1976 to 1994 before it was
federally amended in 2005. Further, we apply difference-in-difference (DID)
strategy and consider triangulation approach to identify women empowerment
indicators namely: access to resources, agency, and outcomes to measure varying
dimensions of empowerment. Using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-I),
our results indicate a positive impact on marriage choice, intimate partner
violence, physical, and civil autonomy. However, negative impact on household
autonomy and no significant on economic participation for women exposed to
state amendments. Further, exploring the heterogeneities in terms of
socio-economic status, location, level of patriarchy in a state, gender of the
head of the household. Overall, the study highlights that the impact of
inheritance law is not unfirm across different groups.

TL;DR: 本文研究了卢旺达农业生产力冲击对教育入学率的影响，发现小学入学率呈逆周期变化，而中学入学率呈顺周期变化，且存在显著的性别差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨农业经济中家庭在即时生产需求和长期人力资本投资之间的权衡，特别是在严重依赖雨养农业的卢旺达。

Method: 使用2010-2021年地区面板数据，采用两阶段最小二乘法(2SLS)工具变量策略，以外生降雨变化作为植被健康指数(NDVI)的工具变量。

Result: 小学入学率与生产力冲击呈负相关，男孩比女孩更敏感；中学入学率与生产力冲击呈正相关，但持续积极冲击会导致女性中学入学率下降。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了先前支持"女孩作为缓冲"假设的地区发现，揭示了经济冲击持续性的动态和性别化反应。

Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off that households in agrarian economies
face between immediate production needs and long-term human capital investment.
We ask how exogenous agricultural productivity shocks affect primary and
secondary school enrollment in Rwanda, a country characterized by a heavy
reliance on rain-fed agriculture alongside ambitious development goals. Using a
district-level panel dataset for the years 2010-2021, we employ a two-stage
least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable strategy. Plausibly exogenous
variation in annual rainfall is used to instrument for a satellite-derived
measure of vegetation health and agricultural productivity, the Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), allowing for a causal interpretation of the
results. For primary education, where direct costs are low, enrollment is
countercyclical: positive productivity shocks are associated with lower
enrollment. Notably, boys' primary enrollment is found to be significantly more
elastic to these shocks than girls' enrollment. Conversely, for secondary
education, which entails additional financial outlays, enrollment is strongly
procyclical. Positive productivity shocks lead to significant increases in
enrollment. Further, a sustained positive shock is associated with a subsequent
decline in female secondary enrollment. The results challenge previous regional
findings supporting the "girls as a buffer" hypothesis and investigate the
dynamic and gendered responses to the persistence of economic shocks.

TL;DR: 使用欧元区个人收入微观调查数据，研究发现正向金融冲击会增加收入不平等，主要通过金融收入差异和技能溢价两个渠道传导，且存在不对称效应：正向冲击扩大差距，负向冲击则相反。


<details>

Motivation: 研究金融冲击对收入分配的动态影响，特别关注不同收入群体的异质性反应和传导机制。

Method: 基于调查微观数据，将个人收入分解为金融收入和劳动收入，采用非线性模型框架区分正向和负向金融冲击。

Result: 正向金融冲击增加收入不平等，主要体现在收入分布的两端；金融收入不平等上升源于资产持有差异，劳动收入不平等通过技能溢价渠道上升；负向冲击对中产收入群体影响显著。

Conclusion: 金融冲击对收入分配具有不对称效应，不同收入群体对冲击的脆弱性存在差异，政策制定需考虑这些分布效应。

Abstract: We estimate the dynamic distributional effects of financial shocks in the
Euro Area using survey-based microdata on personal incomes. We find that
positive financial shocks increase inequality, with heterogeneity across
different income groups. Much of the response emerges in the tails of the
income distribution. By decomposing individual incomes into financial and labor
components, we identify two distinct transmission mechanisms: financial income
inequality rises, likely due to differences in asset holdings. In contrast,
labor income inequality increases through a skill premium channel. We then
consider a nonlinear model framework, distinguishing the sign of the shock,
allowing us to document the presence of asymmetric effects. While positive
shocks lead to income disparities, adverse shocks have the opposite effect.
Notably, middle-income groups are only affected following a negative shock,
highlighting differential vulnerabilities across the income distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DRGrad框架来解决多任务学习中的负迁移和跷跷板现象，通过路由器、更新器和个性化门网络来管理任务冲突，在真实推荐数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习在推荐系统中面临负迁移和跷跷板现象的挑战，由于现实推荐中任务相关性复杂且矛盾，需要更好地利用个性化信息来管理任务冲突。

Method: DRGrad框架包含三个关键组件：路由器、更新器和个性化门网络，在训练过程中判断任务间的利害关系，利用所有有效梯度来减少冲突。

Result: 在包含150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上，DRGrad在AUC指标上优于现有最先进的多任务学习模型，有效管理任务冲突而不增加模型复杂度，同时在噪声处理方面也有改进。

Conclusion: DRGrad能够有效判断和路由具有不同程度相关性和个性化任务间的利害关系，在公共数据集和合成数据集上的实验验证了其能力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个集成CCTV监控视频和多源数据的统一框架，用于实时城市交通预测，在CityFlowV2数据集上达到98.46%的准确率，并通过频繁序列模式挖掘发现交通拥堵转换模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速城市化加剧了交通拥堵、环境压力和交通系统低效问题，传统基于静态信号和手动监控的系统无法适应现代交通的动态特性，迫切需要智能自适应交通管理解决方案。

Method: 采用时空特征融合、频繁序列挖掘(FEM)用于顺序交通模式发现，以及混合LSTM-Transformer模型进行鲁棒的交通状态预测。

Result: 在包含46个摄像头313,931个标注边界框的CityFlowV2数据集上，实现了98.46%的预测准确率，宏精确度0.9800，宏召回率0.9839，宏F1分数0.9819。FEM分析揭示了置信度超过55%的中度-拥堵转换等显著顺序模式，系统生成了46个持续拥堵警报。

Conclusion: 强调需要将视频流分析与多源数据结合，设计实时、响应式、自适应的多层次智能交通系统，使城市出行更智能和安全。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器（如有限元方法）计算成本高，特别是在大规模或实时场景下。需要更高效的方法来模拟复杂声学材料中的波传播。

Method: 使用基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet的深度学习方法，将解表示为图像，利用GPU并行化同时处理多个模拟，无需复杂仿真软件和显式方程求解。

Result: 该方法能够显著减少计算时间，扩散步骤数可在推理时调整以平衡速度和质量。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法是早期研究阶段的有用工具，此时快速探索比绝对精度更重要。

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出GradFix方法，通过分析新模型梯度符号结构来跨模型迁移任务向量，仅需少量标注样本即可实现知识迁移，无需额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型新版本发布时，即使任务相同也需要重新全量微调。任务向量在不同预训练模型间迁移困难，因为参数空间不对齐。

Method: 基于梯度符号结构分析，提出GradFix方法：计算目标模型少量梯度，根据梯度符号结构对源任务向量进行掩码，实现局部对齐。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中显著提升性能，持续优于朴素任务向量相加和少样本微调方法。

Conclusion: 梯度符号结构是跨模型任务向量迁移的关键，GradFix方法能有效将任务向量重新映射到新预训练模型上，确保一阶下降。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点集神经网络的方法来处理NOvA实验中稀疏的2D探测器数据，该方法通过混合两个视图的信息，在减少90%内存使用的同时，实现了96.8%的AUC分数，优于独立处理两个视图的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NOvA实验需要将探测器中的原始命中点匹配到源粒子并识别粒子类型。传统方法使用聚类和CNN，但由于探测器结构，数据以两个稀疏的2D图像（XZ和YZ视图）呈现，而不是3D表示，需要更高效的处理方法。

Method: 使用点集神经网络处理稀疏矩阵，通过混合两个视图信息的操作来结合XZ和YZ视图的数据，相比传统方法显著减少内存需求。

Result: 模型使用不到10%的内存，实现了96.8%的AUC分数，明显高于两个视图独立处理的85.4% AUC分数。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络方法在处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D探测器数据方面表现出色，在显著减少内存使用的同时提高了粒子识别的准确性。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Motivation: 扩散概率模型虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然主要隐含在模型中。本文旨在通过构建显式的归纳偏置来更好地适应目标数据分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替换各向同性的前向协方差，统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制特定频带，同时保持前向过程的高斯性。

Result: 实验表明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并实现了选择性省略：在特定频带中忽略已知的损坏模式进行学习。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在扩散概率模型中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的基于Bode图的电化学阻抗谱损失函数log-B和log-BW，通过大规模数据集评估发现X2损失函数在拟合质量上表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率和参数误差方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行拟合，但现有损失函数在收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在局限性，需要开发更优化的损失函数。

Method: 提出了log-B和log-BW两种新的损失函数，基于Bode图表示法，使用大规模生成的EIS数据评估各种损失函数的性能，包括R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和平均绝对百分比误差。

Result: X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B损失函数计算速度快约1.4倍，对大多数电路元件产生更低的MAPE，虽然拟合质量略低。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是主要目标时，X2损失函数是最佳选择；对于大规模数据驱动应用，log-B损失函数是计算效率和参数精度的良好折中方案。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Motivation: 现有的深度监督跨模态哈希方法虽然通过自监督学习语义信息取得了成功，但多标签语义提取过程未能与原始多模态数据显式交互，导致学习的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态间隙的弥合。

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态并重新表述为一组真实标签提示，设计跨模态教师网络来蒸馏图像和标签模态之间的跨模态语义特征，学习图像模态的汉明空间，然后指导跨模态学生网络的学习。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，有效解决了多标签语义提取与原始多模态数据交互不足的问题，提升了跨模态哈希性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LMCache是首个高效的开源KV缓存解决方案，通过跨引擎和查询共享KV缓存来提升LLM推理系统的资源效率，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码分离，结合vLLM可实现高达15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，现有方案无法实现跨引擎和查询的高效KV缓存共享和通信。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，通过优化数据移动（批处理操作、计算和I/O流水线）、模块化连接器组件和灵活的控制API实现高效缓存编排。

Result: 结合vLLM，LMCache在多样化工作负载下实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升，并在企业推理系统中获得广泛采用。

Conclusion: LMCache通过将LLM引擎从独立令牌处理器转变为以KV缓存为存储和通信媒介的引擎集合，为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合归一化流和变分自编码器的空间人口合成方法，能够生成具有精确坐标的合成人口数据，解决了传统方法无法处理空间坐标特殊性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法生成具有明确坐标的合成人口数据，而经纬度坐标具有特殊性质（大范围空区域和高度不均匀密度），需要专门的方法来处理。

Method: 使用归一化流将空间坐标映射到更规则的潜在空间，然后与其它特征结合在变分自编码器中生成合成人口，同时学习空间和非空间特征的联合分布。

Result: 在121个不同地理区域的数据集上验证，NF+VAE架构优于流行的基准方法（包括基于copula的方法和地理区域内均匀分配），在空间准确性和实用性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成精细空间分辨率的合成人口数据，为需要详细地理信息的应用（如洪水响应、流行病传播、疏散规划和交通建模）打开了大门。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Conclusion: C-DPS通过耦合数据空间和测量空间的扩散过程，提供了一种准确稳定的逆问题解决方案

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可以有效地改进因果估计，利用生成模型的历史知识和推理能力解决高维因果推断问题。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential

design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 该研究表明通过调整学习率超参数可以避免神经网络的关键学习期和热启动性能损失问题。关键学习期出现在使用缺陷数据开始训练时，导致网络可塑性下降。使用循环学习率调度可以解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络的可塑性，特别是关键学习期现象——当训练从缺陷数据开始时，网络会失去学习能力，即使后续使用干净数据训练也无法达到从头开始训练的模型精度。同时探索热启动训练与关键学习期之间的联系。

Method: 复制关键学习期研究的核心发现，扩展原始实验范围。考虑热启动方法作为缺陷预训练的一种形式，并测试使用循环学习率调度来避免这些问题。

Result: 实验证明循环学习率调度可以有效避免关键学习期和热启动性能损失，使网络能够达到与从头训练相当的精度水平。

Conclusion: 研究不仅影响了神经网络训练实践，还在关键学习期和热启动神经网络训练之间建立了重要联系，为改进训练策略提供了实证支持。

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Result: 在200轮训练中，通过不同隐私预算、IID/非IID数据集和客户端选择数量的实验表明，自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪能够在保护隐私的同时保持模型准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的解决方案，能够在联邦学习中平衡隐私保护和模型性能，特别是在模型收敛阶段减少不必要噪声的影响。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Result: 所有方法在FBCs、FNs和OG下都能达到10^-6到10^-9的低L2误差。PINNs最可靠，DRM在稳态问题上精度-运行时间平衡最佳，WAN在有效使用弱形式约束时具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 物理引导的神经求解器是解决复杂PDE的可信、可扩展工具，并提出了时间相关公式、自适应采样等扩展方向。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新颖的流式风险检测插件框架，通过建模LM生成过程中的中间隐藏状态，实现实时风险检测，相比后处理检测方法性能更好且延迟更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护措施多为后处理检测，可能在检测到不安全内容前就已暴露，且延迟限制迫使其使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，利用Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时间演化，并引入Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC)损失来强制执行单调危害预测。

Result: 在多样化模型和数据集上，Kelp持续优于最先进的后处理防护措施和先前的插件探针（平均F1提高15.61%），仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加不到0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一种有效的流式风险检测方法，能够在LM生成过程中实时识别有害内容，显著提高了检测准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Conclusion: VCON为现有压缩技术提供了一种通用方法，在多个基准测试中均能带来一致的精度提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

Conclusion: 强化学习框架为特征选择提供了一种新的方法，能够有效防止偏见重现，比传统的预处理调整或事后修正机制更具优势。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提高了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的检测性能。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive

*A. Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦k-means聚类方法，设备在不共享本地数据集的情况下，通过交换聚合信息来联合聚类整体数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦聚类问题，让互连设备能够基于k-means原理进行硬聚类，同时保护本地数据隐私。

Method: 将联邦k-means聚类建模为GTVMin问题，每个设备通过求解带惩罚项的改进本地k-means问题来更新本地聚类中心，惩罚项衡量相邻设备聚类中心的差异。

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需在互连设备间共享聚合信息。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在保护数据隐私前提下的分布式聚类，为联邦学习环境下的聚类问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用上下文向量表示模型能力的新型路由方法，通过两阶段训练实现高效模型路由，支持新模型的无缝集成而无需重新训练路由器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型具有互补优势，但现有路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，且添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器来重建原始查询；2）基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量，路由器学习预测每个模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中都实现了最先进的路由性能，且能够无缝集成新模型而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了模型路由的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

TL;DR: Narrative Learning是一种完全用自然语言定义模型的方法，通过解释性提示而非传统数值优化来迭代改进分类标准。在6个数据集中的5个上，该方法由于语言模型的改进，在2025年或更早时比基线可解释模型更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种完全基于自然语言定义模型的方法，通过解释性提示迭代改进分类标准，而不是依赖传统的数值优化方法。

Method: 使用自然语言完全定义模型，通过解释性提示迭代改进分类标准，在3个合成数据集和3个自然数据集上进行实验，并与7个基线可解释机器学习模型进行比较。

Result: 在6个数据集中的5个上，Narrative Learning由于语言模型的改进，在2025年或更早时比基线可解释模型更准确。同时分析了模型输出的词汇统计趋势作为解释可理解性的代理指标。

Conclusion: Narrative Learning方法在多个数据集上表现出优于传统可解释模型的准确性，特别是在语言模型持续改进的背景下，展示了自然语言定义模型的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

TL;DR: 评估在逐步减少行为输入的情况下，LLM生成过程模型解释的质量，发现在适度减少输入时解释质量基本保持，表明存在实用的成本-质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高，需要探索在资源受限环境下更高效的计算方法。

Method: 建立管道：(i)从固定日志的逐步缩小前缀中发现模型，(ii)提示LLM生成解释，(iii)使用第二个LLM评估完整性、瓶颈识别和建议改进。

Result: 在合成日志上，适度减少输入时解释质量基本保持，表明存在实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为在资源受限环境中实现更高效、LLM辅助的过程分析提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

*Jindong Tian,Yifei Ding,Ronghui Xu,Hao Miao,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARROW是一个用于全球天气预报的自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，通过多时间间隔预测模型和基于强化学习的自适应滚动调度器，解决了现有方法在时空依赖建模和长期预测误差积累方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预报方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，并依赖简单的自回归滚动进行长期预测，这存在两个关键局限：(1) 难以充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖；(2) 滚动策略难以平衡误差积累与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多时间间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的大气动力学共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球的纬度结构。开发基于强化学习的自适应滚动调度器，根据当前天气状态选择最适合的预测时间间隔。

Result: 实验结果表明，ARROW在全球天气预报中实现了最先进的性能，为该领域建立了一个有前景的范式。

Conclusion: ARROW通过多尺度时间建模和自适应滚动策略，有效解决了天气预报中的时空依赖建模和长期预测挑战，为数据驱动的天气预报提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InterCorpRel-LLM框架，结合GNN和LLM来识别企业间关系，在供应链关系识别任务上显著优于GPT-5等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但面临数据规模大、稀疏和上下文依赖等挑战。现有图方法缺乏语义深度，LLM难以表示关系依赖。

Method: 提出跨模态框架，整合GNN和LLM，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，包含公司图匹配、行业分类和供应链关系预测三个训练任务。

Result: 在供应链关系识别任务上F-score达0.8543，远优于GPT-5的0.2287，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争对手识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大的工具，用于映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证词汇假说，探索机器学习是否能替代传统心理学理论来构建人格模型。

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建人格模型，与Big Five模型对比分析百万条Reddit评论。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）在描述在线社区方面更强大且可解释，而机器学习聚类未能提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，且缺乏Big Five的心理测量学一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的。机器学习可以检验现有心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

TL;DR: 提出NCAL-R框架，利用深度网络的几何规律性来对抗不可靠监督，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动评分来选择样本，在噪声标签和分布偏移下实现更可靠的主动学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移时不可靠，因为不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标签或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 结合两个互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化候选样本对类间几何结构的稳定/扭曲程度）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练检查点间表征的时间不稳定性）。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R在合成标签噪声下始终优于标准主动学习基线，用更少标签获得更高准确率，对分布外数据具有更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入获取决策可以使主动学习对标注错误和分布偏移更具鲁棒性，是实现实际标注管道中可信部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

TL;DR: ProtoMM是一个新颖的自监督学习框架，通过引入共享原型字典在多模态时间序列数据中实现更好的表示学习，避免传统对比学习方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态自监督学习方法依赖CLIP风格的对比目标，容易过拟合到易于对齐的特征，并将有效的跨模态关系误分类为负样本，导致碎片化和不可泛化的嵌入表示。

Method: 提出ProtoMM框架，引入共享原型字典来锚定异构模态到共同的嵌入空间，通过围绕共享原型聚类表示而非显式负采样来捕获跨模态的互补信息。

Result: ProtoMM在Pulse Motion基础模型上优于仅使用对比学习和先前的多模态SSL方法，实现了最先进的性能，并提供了更好的学习特征可解释性。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过共享原型字典为生理信号提供了连贯的"共同语言"，能够更好地捕获系统级动态和跨模态互补信息。

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

TL;DR: 提出HeSRN，一种新型异构图表示学习方法，通过槽感知结构编码器和保留机制编码器，在保持强大表达能力的同时实现线性时间复杂度，解决了传统图Transformer在异构图上的计算复杂性和语义建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图Transformer在异构图表示学习中存在两个主要问题：二次计算复杂度限制了可扩展性，以及无法有效建模异构语义导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入槽感知结构编码器，通过将异构特征投影到独立槽中并进行槽归一化和保留融合来解耦节点类型语义；用保留机制编码器替代自注意力机制，实现线性时间复杂度的结构和上下文依赖建模；使用异质保留编码器联合捕获局部结构信号和全局异构语义。

Result: 在四个真实世界异构图数据集上的广泛实验表明，HeSRN在节点分类任务上持续优于最先进的异构图神经网络和图Transformer基线，以显著更低的计算复杂度实现更优的准确率。

Conclusion: HeSRN通过槽感知解耦和保留机制，有效解决了异构图表示学习中的语义纠缠和计算效率问题，为大规模异构图分析提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Method: 在原子间势能学习的几何任务中进行实证研究，分析不同架构在数据、参数和计算量方面的缩放行为。

Result: 发现等变性架构比非等变性模型缩放更好，高阶表示对应更好的缩放指数，且计算最优训练需要数据和模型规模同步缩放。

Conclusion: 不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，特别是在规模化时，因为这些偏置会改变任务的固有难度和缩放规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Conclusion: 机器学习驱动的射频指纹识别框架具有通用性和实用性，能够支持多种下游任务并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在时间序列预测中广泛应用，但实证显示Transformer往往无法超越简单线性模型。本文旨在从理论角度深入理解这一现象，填补现有理论研究的空白。

Method: 通过In-Context Learning理论框架，在AR(p)数据假设下，对线性自注意力模型进行理论分析，并通过精心设计的实验进行实证验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法获得比经典线性模型更低的MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋于无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下，预测会以指数速度退化为均值预测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论局限性，建议研究社区重新审视TSF的基本理论限制，并在应用复杂架构时进行更严格的评估。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

TL;DR: SVTime是一个受大型视觉模型启发的小型时间序列预测模型，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数数量，解决大模型碳足迹和资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练模型虽然性能强大，但训练和推理能耗高、碳足迹大，不适合资源受限的用户。需要开发既紧凑又高性能的轻量级模型来替代大模型。

Method: 识别大型视觉模型预测器的关键归纳偏置，通过精心设计的线性层和约束函数将这些偏置编码到小型模型中。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上，SVTime超越了21个基线模型（包括轻量级、复杂和预训练大模型），性能与大型模型相当但参数减少了10^3倍。

Conclusion: SVTime证明了可以在保持高性能的同时大幅降低模型复杂度，为资源受限环境提供了实用的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AuraGen数据生成引擎和Safiron防护模型，用于在LLM智能体执行前检测计划风险，并发布了Pre-Exec Bench评估基准，填补了预执行安全研究的数据、模型和评估三大空白。

Motivation: 现有防护措施主要在动作执行后运作，难以扩展且缺乏对计划层面的可控监督。某些风险一旦执行会造成严重后果，因此在规划阶段干预是最安全的防护方式。

Conclusion: 该研究为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过填补数据、模型和评估三大空白，实现了在计划层面的可控安全监督。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的新型过采样方法，通过条件生成和排列策略增强合成样本的多样性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE需要将分类变量转换为数值向量，导致信息损失；现有LLM方法生成的少数类样本多样性有限，影响下游分类任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 基于少数类标签和特征的合成样本生成策略；2) 预训练LLM的排列微调策略；3) 在少数类样本和插值样本上微调LLM以增强变异性。

Result: 在10个表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于8个SOTA基线方法，生成的合成样本既真实又多样。

Conclusion: 该方法通过熵基理论分析证明能够促进生成样本的多样性，为处理不平衡分类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Method: 结合时间延迟信息瓶颈和扩散模型的联合训练目标，平衡表征学习和生成目标，能够整合不同温度模拟轨迹。

Result: 在多个分子任务上进行了基准测试，展示了探索训练集外物理条件的潜力。

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一个灵活的架构，能够平衡表征学习和生成目标，并在分子科学中展示出良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Conclusion: 整合时空傅里叶模式能有效提升神经算子在海洋预测中的物理保真度，FNOtD为高频海洋过程建模提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了在视觉Transformer中，信息的可解码性与因果影响之间存在系统性不匹配：中间层的对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，而最终层的对象token可准确解码但功能惰性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是厘清神经网络中经常被混淆的两个概念：可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）与因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度），特别是在视觉Transformer中进行对象计数的场景。

Method: 使用激活修补技术，通过在干净-损坏图像对之间移植激活来测试空间和CLS token的因果作用；同时训练线性探针来评估不同深度的计数信息可解码性。

Result: 结果显示系统性的不匹配：中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能惰性；CLS token在中间层变得可解码，但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Motivation: 传统基于梯度的深度神经网络训练面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难以及顺序结构限制并行化等问题，需要替代的训练方法。

Method: 通过提升训练策略（包括辅助坐标法、Fenchel提升网络和提升Bregman训练）将嵌套优化转化为高维约束优化问题，使用块坐标下降策略和Bregman距离等凸优化工具。

Result: 数值实验表明，相比传统训练方法，提升Bregman方法在标准成像任务中表现出更高的有效性和稳定性，特别适用于使用近端激活函数的架构。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有前景的替代方案，能够改善训练条件、支持分布式优化并处理非可微激活函数。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决连续时间动力系统中存在的近奇异行为和数值不稳定性问题，特别是在处理刚性和湍流过程时，需要一种能够正则化流场同时保持物理守恒律的方法。

Method: 引入平滑单调映射t↦τ(t)进行时间重参数化，在提升的坐标系中使轨迹变得全局光滑，作为连续时间归一化或时间扭曲算子。

Result: 该方法能够使不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程在环面T³上的轨迹变得全局光滑，并稳定物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，为刚性和湍流过程的机器学习建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，而DecompNet旨在分解输入为多个语义可解释的组件，提供更丰富的表示能力。

Method: 使用N个并行分支，每个分支的残差输入定义为原始信号减去其他所有分支的重建结果，通过展开Gauss-Seidel风格的块坐标下降为可微分网络。

Conclusion: DecompNet是第一个实现全除一残差更新规则的语义自编码器，在分解方法中具有新颖性。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降方法，需要为每层选择范数、跨层范数聚合方式以及是否使用归一化。本文旨在系统探索不同的跨层范数聚合替代方案。

Method: 将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，推导出新的Muon优化器变体MuonMax，并将非欧几里得梯度方法与模型动量(Momo)结合。

Result: 实验发现Muon对学习率选择敏感，而MuonMax显著更鲁棒。与Momo结合的Muon变体对超参数调优更鲁棒，通常能获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，当最优超参数未知时，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调优成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: 这项工作成功将语言模型的模式识别能力应用于表格数据的复杂性，为准确且可推广的因果发现迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了非参数化路由器在异常查询上的泛化问题，为LLM查询路由提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

*Kangping Hu,Stephen Mussmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文基于贝叶斯决策理论推导了主动学习算法，提出了ParBaLS方法来解决批量采样中的扩展性问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动学习采集函数众多，但缺乏统一的理论指导。贝叶斯决策理论为决策制定提供了通用原则，可以指导主动学习算法的设计。

Method: 在近视框架下推导贝叶斯决策理论，得到EER、EPIG等算法，并进一步推导出ParBaLS方法来解决批量采样中的计算挑战。

Result: 实验表明，ParBaLS EPIG在固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归神经网络嵌入上，在多个数据集上都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一的理论基础，ParBaLS方法有效解决了批量采样中的扩展性问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

### [295] [TAWRMAC: A Novel Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09884)
*Soheila Farokhi,Xiaojun Qi,Hamid Karimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAWRMAC是一个新颖的动态图表示学习框架，通过整合时序匿名游走重启、记忆增强和邻居共现嵌入，解决了现有方法在嵌入陈旧性、邻居相关性和结构动态捕捉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间方法存在三个关键挑战：(1)仅依赖节点特定记忆而未能有效整合邻居信息，导致嵌入陈旧；(2)未能显式捕捉节点邻居间的相关性，限制上下文感知；(3)未能充分捕捉演化图的结构动态，特别是在缺乏丰富链接属性时。

Method: TAWRMAC框架整合了时序匿名游走重启、记忆增强和邻居共现嵌入。通过固定时间编码的记忆增强GNN提升嵌入稳定性，通过显式捕捉邻居相关性改进上下文表示，并通过时序匿名游走重启机制区分重复交互和形成新连接的节点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下，跨三种不同负采样策略，始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

### [296] [Understanding Robust Machine Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888)
*Yunlong Feng,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在重尾噪声下的鲁棒非参数回归问题，使用Huber回归作为示例，在再生核希尔伯特空间中通过Tikhonov正则化风险最小化来解决两个核心挑战：弱矩假设下标准集中工具失效和无界假设空间带来的分析困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒损失的泛化误差界不能真实反映样本外性能，需要重新定义可学习性度量。在无界函数空间和重尾噪声条件下，现有分析方法失效，需要新的理论框架。

Method: 引入概率有效假设空间来约束估计器，建立新的比较定理将超额鲁棒风险与L2预测误差联系起来，在弱(1+ε)-矩条件下进行偏差-方差分解。

Result: 建立了Huber回归在RKHS中的显式有限样本误差界和收敛率，无需一致有界性假设，适用于重尾噪声情况。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险应作为分析鲁棒学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并可推广到其他鲁棒损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

### [297] [Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891)
*Parsa Gooya,Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架，用于北极海冰浓度的季节性预测，能够生成大量调整后的预测集合，改善预测校准度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的北极海冰浓度季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂的时空误差，传统的一对一后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性，而决策制定需要适当的概率信息特别是极端事件的概率。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型，学习给定有偏差模型预测条件下观测数据的条件分布，从而能够生成大量调整后的预测集合。

Result: 调整后的预测在校准度、与观测分布的接近程度以及误差方面均优于基于气候平均值的调整预测。

Conclusion: 该概率误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的质量，为决策提供更可靠的不确定性信息。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过多级注意力机制显式建模临床特征间的时间传播影响，在预测准确性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法显式建模临床变量间随时间变化的潜在依赖关系，要么依赖黑盒机制，要么采用简单聚合，缺乏对特征影响传播的明确建模。

Method: CoI采用多级注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建显式的时间展开影响图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上的评估显示，CoI在死亡率和疾病进展预测任务中显著优于现有方法，并能发现具有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪影响路径，展示任何时间点的任何特征如何直接或通过影响其他变量来贡献最终预测，为临床决策提供深入洞察。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J是一个提示增强框架，通过构建包含常见错误和修复的固定错误数据集，为轻量级LLM提供结构化指导，显著提升PyTorch到JAX的代码翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX较新且在公共代码中代表性不足，平行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试方面存在弱点。

Method: 构建两阶段管道：(i) 从TorchLeet和CodeParrot收集PyTorch源代码，使用GPT-4o-mini生成初始JAX草稿；(ii) 专业开发者迭代修复草稿直至功能等价，构建包含常见错误和补丁的固定错误数据集；(iii) 构建增强提示，从这些修复中注入结构化指导来引导轻量级LLM。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，在T2J FixCost Score上提升50%，在T2J CodeTrans Score（0-4分制）上提升1.33分，在T2J Comparison Score上提升100%；生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过系统化的提示增强方法，有效解决了PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的挑战，显著提升了翻译质量和效率，为跨框架代码转换提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer中Layer Normalization的不同放置位置进行了理论分析，研究了前向传播（隐藏状态）和后向传播（梯度）的稳定性，为训练动态提供了关键见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程可能不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能提高训练稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论指导。

Method: 通过理论分析不同Layer Normalization放置位置下的前向稳定性和后向稳定性，推导隐藏状态增长的显式边界，分析梯度反向传播的影响，并指导残差连接的缩放策略。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置对训练动态的影响，数值结果验证了理论发现，提供了检查新架构修改稳定性的原则性框架。

Conclusion: 本研究为Layer Normalization在Transformer中的放置提供了理论指导，建立了分析训练稳定性的框架，有助于未来Transformer架构的设计和改进。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够自动决定何时增加或减少学习率，并在多种优化任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能高度依赖学习率的选择，但手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时，期望用户调整学习率可能不切实际。

Method: 引入AutoGD方法，自动确定在给定迭代中是否增加或减少学习率，无需了解平滑度常数，并扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 实验证明该方法在传统问题和变分推断优化任务中表现强劲，能够恢复GD的最优速率（最多相差一个常数）。

Conclusion: AutoGD为梯度下降方法提供了一种自动化的学习率调整方案，解决了手动调参的痛点，在多种场景下都表现出色。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复数卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点关注保留和利用实值网络常忽略的相位信息。研究通过理论框架和实验验证，证明复数网络在音频分类任务中具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而相位在音频处理中具有重要价值。研究旨在开发能够有效利用相位信息的复数神经网络架构。

Method: 提出复数卷积神经网络的理论框架，包括复数卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和复数激活函数。采用复数批归一化和权重初始化确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: 在图像数据集上，复数CNN与实值CNN性能相当；在音频分类中，复数CNN在实值MFCC上略优于实值CNN；通过图神经网络建模相位信息，在二元和多类流派分类中都取得了可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复数架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要进一步发展相位感知设计来充分利用复数表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MemPromptTSS框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有时间序列分割方法中提示影响快速衰减的问题，实现了跨整个序列的迭代多粒度分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割的提示方法只在局部上下文操作，提示效果快速衰减，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够持久保持提示影响的方法来支持迭代细化。

Method: 使用记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为存储在记忆库中的记忆令牌，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还能基于所有迭代中积累的提示，确保其影响在整个序列中持续存在。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理中比最佳基线在单粒度和多粒度分割上分别提升了23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中平均每次迭代增益为2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 信息论分析指导下的SQS-SD框架有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

TL;DR: 提出CRG_IMSC方法，通过非负约束直接获得聚类结果，并利用连通性矩阵改进不完全多视图谱聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类需要K-means后处理，且未有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: 施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，构建连通性矩阵并最小化自表示残差，使用乘法更新迭代算法求解。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于现有聚类方法，并验证了算法收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC有效解决了不完全多视图聚类问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Result: 建立了最优策略等价的充分条件，推导了近似误差上界和性能下界，实验验证了理论结果并与七种算法进行了比较评估。

Conclusion: 提出的同态抽象框架和HPG/EBHPG算法能够在状态聚合中平衡计算效率和性能损失，确保最优策略等价性。

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)算法，用于解决基于流匹配的视觉-语言-动作模型在强化学习中的重要性采样不可行问题，通过重新定义重要性采样并集成多种优化技术，实现了稳定可扩展的在线强化微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型性能受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围，而传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样不可行而计算不可行。

Method: FPO算法通过利用条件流匹配目标的每样本变化重新定义重要性采样，集成结构感知信用分配、裁剪代理目标、多步潜在探索和Q集成机制等技术。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务中，FPO相比监督学习、偏好对齐、扩散基、自回归在线RL和π₀-FAST基线方法表现出持续改进，在稀疏奖励下实现稳定学习。

Conclusion: FPO有效解决了流匹配模型在线强化学习中的计算挑战，通过提出的计算模块实现了条件流匹配目标的稳定收敛，验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Result: 在真实世界传感器数据上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确识别增材制造中缺陷异常的起始点，解决了现有方法在检测细微语义异常方面的不足。

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多只关注单一类型的图表示，而函数调用图和进程交互图的联合建模尚未充分探索，这为软件系统的多视角分析提供了机会。

Method: 构建了635个Windows可执行文件的数据集，使用Ghidra提取FCGs，Any.Run沙箱提取PCGs。GeminiNet采用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制来学习联合嵌入。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模静态的函数调用图和动态的进程交互图，GeminiNet能够提供更全面的软件系统分析视角，在恶意软件检测等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性的WDRO方法存在上界松弛或计算复杂的问题，需要更紧的上界和更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用原始方法，引入精确Lipschitz证书概念，提出Wasserstein分布攻击(WDA)直接构造最坏情况分布，利用ReLU网络在激活单元上的分段仿射结构。

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法在保持竞争性鲁棒精度的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决WDRO中的上界松弛和计算复杂性问题，为对抗鲁棒性提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出BITE（双向时频金字塔网络），一种端到端的统一架构，通过多流协同、金字塔时频注意力和双向自适应卷积，解决EEG识别模型跨范式泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，存在跨范式泛化能力差的问题，需要开发更鲁棒的架构。

Method: 采用对齐的时频流保持时间同步，基于PTFA的多尺度特征增强，以及BiTCN双向自适应卷积捕获前向/后向神经动态。

Result: 在四个不同范式（BCICIV-2A/2B、HGD、SD-SSVEP）上达到最先进性能，在受试者内精度和跨受试者泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 验证了范式对齐的谱时处理对于可靠BCI系统的重要性，BITE作为一个统一架构，在MI和SSVEP任务中均表现出鲁棒性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，利用更强LLM的元认知能力作为教师，通过识别学生模型缺失的技能并针对性训练，显著提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在训练数据与预训练数据相似时效果有限，需要更有效的技能针对性训练方法。

Method: 教师模型创建任务所需技能列表，标记每个数据点所需技能，追踪学生缺失技能，通过STAT-Sel重加权训练样本或STAT-Syn合成新样本进行针对性训练。

Result: 在MATH上提升达7.5%，在分布外基准上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练实现了高效的模型无关强化学习，在小样本场景下具有优势，并已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for

Motivation: 现有学习方法忽视实际稳定性约束，且在跨不同箱子尺寸时泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: O4M-SP在三维装箱问题中表现出强大的实用性和泛化能力，特别是在考虑稳定性约束时。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Conclusion: Translution成功统一了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持性能的同时通过轻量变体解决了参数过多问题。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在时间序列分类中表现出色，但它们可能依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，这种捷径行为在时间序列领域尚未得到充分研究。现有研究多关注外部属性，而忽略了时间序列模型内部的偏差行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于其他类的简单检测方法，用于识别捷径学习行为，该方法不需要测试数据或干净的训练类别。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

TL;DR: 循环注意力变换器在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准变换器，本文从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象，提出SHIFT分阶段训练框架来加速循环注意力的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环注意力变换器在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准变换器，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形和V形山谷，基于循环注意力的递归架构诱导River-V-Valley景观偏置，提出SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明V形山谷景观偏置能保证更好的损失收敛，并鼓励学习复杂模式，SHIFT框架能加速训练同时保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 循环注意力的优势源于其诱导的V形山谷景观偏置，SHIFT框架有效加速训练过程，为理解循环注意力机制提供了理论依据。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过着色算法将图神经网络的表达能力和泛化能力联系起来，证明了Weisfeiler-Leman着色诱导的等价类数量直接限制了GNN的Rademacher复杂度，揭示了表达能力越强泛化能力越弱的理论原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释图神经网络中观察到的现象：表达能力更强的GNN虽然能区分更多图结构，但泛化误差也更高，需要从理论上理解这种权衡关系。

Method: 通过着色算法框架，将WL等价类数量与Rademacher复杂度联系起来，分析表达能力和泛化能力之间的理论关系。

Result: 证明了WL着色等价类数量直接限制GNN的Rademacher复杂度，表达能力增强会导致复杂度增加和泛化保证减弱，且该复杂度对颜色计数的扰动具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNN表达能力和泛化能力的研究，为理解表达能力增强往往以牺牲泛化为代价提供了理论基础，且适用于任意GNN架构和表达能力度量。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，将生成式预训练扩展到用户行为建模，通过结构化标记化、序列模式识别和统一用户画像嵌入，在微信支付中实现了25.6%的下次交易预测提升和38.6%的欺诈检测召回率改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为构成一个独特的模态，每个动作包含时间、上下文、交易类型等多维属性，建模这些高基数序列具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架：1）结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇表；2）序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；3）统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计和动态交易历史；4）通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时推理。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署运行，PANTHER在下次交易预测HitRate@1上提升25.6%，欺诈检测召回率相对改进38.6%。在公共基准上的跨域评估显示强泛化能力，相比transformer基线实现高达21%的HitRate@1增益。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，成功将生成式预训练应用于用户行为建模，实现了显著的性能提升和实际部署价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Lighter-X框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将GNN推荐系统的参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，其中h≪n，显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护大小为d的嵌入，参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图应用中面临可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数冗余，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化模型训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X是一个高效模块化框架，可无缝集成到现有GNN推荐架构中，显著减少参数和计算复杂度，实现大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架，结合LLMs和GNNs的优势进行少样本节点分类，通过GNN偏好驱动节点选择器和节点偏好驱动GNN选择器实现高效知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但存在可扩展性问题，需要结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 开发GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点选择最合适的教师GNN，实现从教师GNNs到学生GNN的定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，有效解决了少样本节点分类问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统中TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过小辅助LLM识别关键token来选择性重计算KV缓存，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存重用方法在RAG场景下面临基本权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但在RAG中很少出现，直接预计算会因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力汇聚而牺牲质量。

Method: CacheClip集成三种技术：辅助模型引导的token选择用于选择性KV缓存重计算、共享前缀消除冗余注意力汇聚、分组策略在部分KV缓存更新时保持局部连贯性。

Result: 实验显示CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上分别提升25.2%和35.1%，同时将LLM推理加速1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速TTFT和高质量生成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 引入可学习通道置换(LCP)，利用Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转化为可微分的软置换矩阵；采用高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度；与现有一次性剪枝方法无缝集成。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的大量实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM通过可学习的通道置换有效缓解剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了更优的优化方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究深度学习天气预报模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性，特别是在台风轨迹预测方面。现有方法难以生成能可靠引导下游输出朝向攻击者指定轨迹的扰动上游预测，主要面临TC检测系统不可微、TC事件罕见导致的类别不平衡以及保持物理一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出了Cyc-Attack方法：1）预训练可微替代模型来近似TC检测器的输出；2）使用偏度感知损失函数和核膨胀策略解决不平衡问题；3）采用基于距离的梯度加权方案和正则化来约束扰动并消除虚假轨迹，确保对抗性预测的逼真性。

Result: 该方法能够有效生成对抗性台风轨迹，解决了传统梯度攻击不可行的问题，同时处理了类别不平衡和物理一致性的挑战。

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack为深度学习天气预报模型的对抗攻击提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在台风轨迹预测这一重要应用场景中，揭示了此类模型的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE通过频域分解提供了时间序列的数学抽象，实现了可解释且稳健的预测，在性能和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal
processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution.
However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic
MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the
response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we
introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed
for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models
(featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22
Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9
implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems,
offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of
different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future
research. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于柯西积分公式的新型神经网络CauchyNet，用于函数逼近任务，包括时间序列预测和缺失数据插补等。该网络通过将实值数据嵌入复平面，有效捕捉复杂时间依赖关系，在预测性能和计算效率上超越传统实值模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值模型在处理复杂时间依赖关系时存在局限性，需要开发更高效的函数逼近方法，特别是在资源受限和数据稀缺的环境中。

Method: 基于柯西积分公式，将实值数据嵌入复平面，采用复值激活函数，构建紧凑参数架构，减少计算开销。

Result: 在交通、能源消耗和流行病学数据等多个领域的实验中，CauchyNet在预测准确性上持续优于最先进模型，平均绝对误差降低50%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: CauchyNet作为一种有效且高效的数据驱动预测建模工具，在资源受限和数据稀缺环境中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in
resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: 提出RLFR方法，利用潜在空间中的流场构建奖励信号，通过量化策略潜在在流场中的速度偏差作为奖励，改善强化学习中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于二元验证的强化学习方法容易忽视推理轨迹中的有价值探索，而构建黄金过程奖励模型成本高昂。现有方法使用熵和似然度等辅助信号进行奖励塑造，但潜在空间的表达能力未被充分探索。

Method: 从离策略高质量数据或在线拒绝采样数据构建模型潜在空间的流场，量化策略潜在在流场中的速度偏差作为奖励信号。利用隐藏状态中压缩的高效上下文依赖关系，而非单个词元级别的表示。

Result: 在语言和多模态推理基准测试中验证了流奖励的可靠性，表明构建良好的流场可以作为有效的奖励信号收集环境。

Conclusion: RLFR展示了利用潜在空间流场进行奖励塑造的可行性和有效性，为使用辅助信号进行奖励塑造提供了一个有前景的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

TL;DR: GraphBFN：基于贝叶斯流网络的分层粗到细分子图生成框架，通过累积分布函数统一训练目标与采样舍入操作，解决连续扩散模型在分子图生成中的训练-推理不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前连续扩散模型在分子图生成中，训练时预测连续数值（回归任务），但推理时需要舍入为离散类别（分类操作），这种训练目标与推理过程的不一致导致模型过度关注点对点精度，限制了分子多样性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出GraphBFN框架，基于贝叶斯流网络在分布参数上操作，通过引入累积分布函数计算正确类别的概率，从而统一训练目标与采样舍入操作。

Result: 在QM9和ZINC250k分子图生成基准测试中取得最优性能，并实现更快的生成速度。

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练与推理过程，解决了连续扩散模型在分子图生成中的根本限制，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统计哥德尔机(SGM)，第一个用于递归编辑的统计安全层，用统计置信测试替代证明要求，在选定的置信水平下认证改进，同时分配全局错误预算来限制累积风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归自修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中越来越重要，但现有框架无法确保这种更改的安全性。哥德尔机通过要求形式化改进证明来提供原则性保护，但在随机高维环境中无法获得此类证明。

Method: 引入统计哥德尔机(SGM)，用统计置信测试(如e值、Hoeffding界)替代基于证明的要求，仅在选定置信水平下认证优越性时允许修改，同时分配全局错误预算来限制多轮累积风险。提出确认触发谐波支出(CTHS)，通过确认事件而非轮次来索引支出，将错误预算集中在有希望的编辑上，同时保持族有效性。

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化的实验中验证了SGM的作用：在CIFAR-100上认证真实增益，在ImageNet-100上拒绝虚假改进，在RL和优化基准测试中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果将SGM定位为学习系统中持续、风险感知自修改的基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进尺度卷积网络(PSCNet)，结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率数据，将低分辨率SMAP土壤湿度产品降尺度到10公里空间分辨率和3小时时间分辨率，在青藏高原地区取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决土壤湿度时间尺度反演中因地表辅助因子不完整而受阻的问题，通过引入高时间分辨率ERA5-Land变量来改进低分辨率SMAP产品的降尺度过程。

Method: 设计了PSCNet网络，核心包含多频时间融合模块(MFTF)用于捕捉时间动态，以及定制的挤压-激励(SE)模块用于保留精细空间细节。

Result: 在青藏高原2016-2018年的实验中，PSCNet在卫星产品验证中平均R值达0.881，优于其他方法；在现场站点验证中R指标始终排名前三；时间泛化验证中所有方法的平均相对误差控制在6%以内。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤湿度数据中复杂的时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Conclusion: MPPReasoner能够生成化学合理的推理路径，为分子性质分析提供有价值的见解，显著增强了可解释性和对化学家的实际实用性。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车辆路径问题的深度学习模型通常在单一规模实例上训练和评估，这严重限制了它们在不同问题规模间的泛化能力，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 采用持续学习框架，按问题规模升序训练模型；设计任务间正则化保留小规模问题知识，任务内正则化模仿最新理想行为，并利用经验回放缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在各种问题规模（包括训练中未见过的规模）上均取得显著优于现有深度模型的性能，包括专门用于增强泛化能力的模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的持续学习框架能有效提升车辆路径问题深度学习模型的跨规模泛化能力，消融研究验证了关键设计的协同效应。

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长文本中表现出"中间信息丢失"现象，这与人类记忆的首因效应和近因效应相似。研究发现这不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是模型对不同信息检索需求的适应表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在长文本中信息检索性能下降的原因，特别是为什么关键信息在中间位置时性能最差，这种现象与人类记忆模式相似。

Method: 从零开始训练GPT-2和Llama变体模型，使用模拟长时记忆和短时记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式，分析模型在序列完成任务中的表现。

Result: 模型表现出U形性能曲线：开头和结尾信息检索性能较好，中间较差。近因效应与训练数据中的短时记忆需求直接相关，首因效应由均匀的长时记忆需求诱导，并受自回归特性和注意力汇形成的影响。

Conclusion: LLMs中的位置偏差是由信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中结构性注意力动态共同作用产生的，这反映了模型对不同记忆需求的适应性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆，而临床推理是一个假设驱动的迭代过程，需要从有限信息中逐步完善诊断。

Method: 构建了1762个医生策划的临床案例作为交互式场景，模拟医学培训中的口头考试，要求AI代理主动探索相关信息、选择适当检查并在多步骤中综合信息。

Result: 当前LLM在描述完整的临床表现时能胜任诊断，但在需要不确定性下进行迭代诊断推理时性能显著下降，识别出四种常见认知错误模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理和决策的根本局限性。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个基于提示的框架，将强化学习中的后见经验回放应用于语言模型智能体，通过从失败尝试中生成优化的替代目标轨迹来提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中部署时，从顺序交互中学习的样本效率较低，这在交互成本高的环境中（如与人类互动或重置物理系统）严重限制了其实用性。现有架构未能充分利用语言模型生成或推理完整反事实轨迹的能力。

Method: ECHO包含两个组件：后见规则（使用语言模型识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（在内存中维护压缩的轨迹表示）。该框架从失败的交互中生成可实现替代目标的优化轨迹，从而创建合成的正面示例。

Result: 在XMiniGrid（基于文本的导航和规划基准）和PeopleJoinQA（协作信息收集企业模拟）上的评估显示，ECHO比普通语言智能体基线性能提升高达80%；在XMiniGrid中，还优于Reflexion和AWM等复杂架构，通过更有效地利用过去经验实现对新环境的更快适应。

Conclusion: ECHO通过将后见经验回放引入语言模型智能体，显著提高了样本效率和环境适应性，证明了利用语言模型生成反事实轨迹能力的有效性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云、分子交互）上效率低，且通过稀疏化会丢失多尺度信息，需要克服这一限制。

Method: 使用图元组框架将图划分为不相交子图，捕获局部和长程连接，采用异构消息传递架构，受非交换算子理论启发。

Result: 在分子属性预测和宇宙学参数推断两个应用上，多视图图元组模型性能优于单图基线。

Conclusion: 多视图方法具有更强的表达能力和更低的oracle风险，在科学应用中展现出强大的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,

participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world

*Ziyi Wei,Huaiyang Zhong,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究多组均值估计问题，提出无探索分配方法，相比传统多臂老虎机更注重均匀准确估计而非最小化遗憾，并扩展到上下文老虎机设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多组均值估计问题，需要均匀准确地估计所有组的均值，这与传统多臂老虎机最小化遗憾的目标不同，最优分配需要采样每个组Θ(T)次。

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式加强次高斯方差集中性结果，设计无探索的非自适应和自适应算法，并扩展到上下文老虎机设置利用侧信息。

Result: 建立了比现有结果更严格的遗憾界限，识别了严格次高斯分布类以获得更尖锐的保证，提出了具有可证明保证的上下文算法。

Conclusion: 无探索分配是多组均值估计的原则性和高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要多组准确推断的领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

### [347] [Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10375)
*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB提出了一种新的监督式非负矩阵分解方法，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三分解的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵而非特征矩阵，实现端到端的分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMF方法是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督或半监督扩展通常通过惩罚项或图约束来整合标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: 将标签矩阵Y作为观测值，协变量A作为解释变量，通过非负矩阵三分解直接获得类别成员概率，无需单独分类器。支持核相似度和半监督学习。

Result: 在从基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集上的实验表明，NMF-LAB在预测准确性、对噪声或不完整标签的鲁棒性、高维问题的可扩展性方面具有竞争力，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过将回归和分类统一在三分解框架内，NMF-LAB为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeDiff是一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成，通过宏步扩展、双空间去噪和双空间验证器实现高效可控的图生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图生成中缺乏可控性，质量不稳定且难以整合新目标；推理时引导方法虽然无需重新训练但存在局部性、启发式和可控性有限的问题。

Method: 提出TreeDiff框架：1) 宏步扩展策略将多个去噪更新分组为单次转换；2) 双空间去噪机制结合潜在空间高效去噪和图空间轻量离散校正；3) 双空间验证器从部分去噪图中预测长期奖励。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，TreeDiff在无条件和有条件设置下均达到最先进性能，且推理时间扩展性良好，能随计算资源增加持续改进。

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架有效解决了图生成中的可控性问题，在保持计算可行性的同时实现了更好的性能扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer在上下文学习中的算法机制，发现在分类任务中Transformer仍然通过梯度下降进行学习，但在核特征空间中进行，且softmax注意力具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要关注线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而Transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练。本文旨在弥合这一差距，研究在分类任务和非线性激活（特别是softmax）设置下的上下文学习机制。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究Transformer在分类任务中的上下文学习算法，特别关注softmax注意力机制在核特征空间中的梯度下降行为。

Result: 发现Transformer在分类任务中仍然通过梯度下降进行上下文学习，但在核特征空间中进行，且softmax注意力具有上下文自适应学习率。实验验证了softmax注意力对上下文具有更强的适应性。

Conclusion: 这项研究增强了在更现实设置下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，推动了直觉认识，并为向更大模型的理论桥梁奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，在CTR预测中取得更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直扩展通过层堆叠提高模型表达能力但计算效率低，水平扩展通过MoE实现高效扩展但难以捕捉推荐任务中的层次结构。HiLoMoE结合两者的优势，推动投资回报边界。

Method: 采用轻量级rank-1专家实现参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个具有分层路由的MoE层以支持组合多样的专家组合。基于前层分数而非输出进行路由，实现所有层并行执行。使用三阶段训练框架确保稳定优化和专家多样性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验显示，HiLoMoE相比非MoE基线平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE框架在CTR预测中实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，验证了分层LoRA MoE方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架未考虑阿尔茨海默病纵向数据中特征相关性的时间变化特性，限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项，同时考虑任务间时间平滑性和特征间动态相关性，使用ADMM算法求解非光滑优化问题。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架优于各种基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间时间变化关系，有效提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了反向监督策略的计算复杂性，证明即使有量子计算等加速技术，监督学习仍需要人类提供初始标签和先验知识。生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，但需要人类监督来确保质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在计算能力极大提升的背景下，监督学习是否仍然需要人类的初始监督输入，以及生成式AI在其中的作用。

Method: 分析反向监督策略的计算复杂性，该策略在未标记数据集上搜索最小化标记集误差的标签分配，搜索空间为2^n指数级。

Result: 即使有常数级加速，计算复杂度仍为指数级，无法消除对信息性标签和先验知识的需求。生成式AI可作为标签放大器，但需要人类指定的目标、种子监督和验证。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度只能减少运行时间，但无法减少学习的基本监督需求。初始人类（或人类级别）输入对于将系统锚定在预期任务中仍然是必要的。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Conclusion: 该方法能够预测新实验环境中的反事实行为，支持多个体建模以生成灵活的条件轨迹，有望模拟和阐明复杂的多动物行为。

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Result: 在9个IoT相关数据集和4个骨干架构上的广泛实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: LightSAE通过利用辅助组件的低秩和聚类特性，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，实现了参数效率和预测性能的平衡。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，能够满足多样化的服务级别目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于核的相对相似性测试方法存在核选择问题：一旦先手动指定假设，总能找到使该假设被拒绝的核函数，这使得测试在指定假设后选择核函数时变得不明确。

Method: 提出锚点最大差异(AMD)方法，在深度核空间中同时学习假设和核函数。分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计深度核空间中的AMD并推断潜在假设；第二阶段评估潜在假设的统计显著性，提出统一测试框架为不同可能假设推导阈值。

Result: 通过理论验证和在基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法通过同时学习假设和核函数，有效解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择挑战，提供了一种更可靠的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

*Kanishkha Jaisankar,Sunidhi Tandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Align2Act是一个将指令调优大语言模型转化为可解释规划器的运动规划框架，通过结构化驾驶指令和逐步推理，在nuPlan数据集上实现了优越的闭环性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用预定义规则或从驾驶数据学习生成轨迹，而现有LLM方法是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑尚不明确。

Method: 提出Align2Act框架，基于人类推理模式和交通规则构建结构化驾驶指令，通过Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，使用LoRA在nuPlan数据集上微调LLaMA-2-7B。

Result: 在Test14-random上获得85.17开环分数，以及70.31（非反应式）和66.96（反应式）闭环分数，在真实世界nuPlan闭环基准上表现出改进的规划质量和人类相似性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了基于LLM的规划器性能，证明了将LLM与人类驾驶逻辑对齐的有效性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

TL;DR: 提出了f-influence框架，通过假设测试考虑训练随机性，实现稳定可靠的影响估计，并开发了f-INE算法在单次训练中计算影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有影响估计方法在训练随机性下不稳定，同一样本在不同运行中可能被判断为关键或无关，这影响了数据清理和模型调试的可靠性

Method: 基于假设测试的f-influence框架，设计了高效的f-INE算法，能在单次训练运行中计算样本影响

Result: 成功将f-INE扩展到Llama-3.1-8B模型，能可靠检测操纵模型意见的投毒样本，验证了在数据清理和行为归因中的实用性

Conclusion: f-influence框架解决了影响估计的稳定性问题，为可靠的数据清理和模型调试提供了有效工具

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于医疗数据合成的混合框架，结合五种增强方法和强化学习权重选择，通过高级校准技术生成高保真度的合成数据，在保护隐私的同时保持数据统计特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗研究面临数据稀缺和隐私法规限制，阻碍AI模型开发和患者护理进步。合成数据生成可以模拟真实数据统计特性同时保护患者隐私。

Method: 混合框架集成噪声注入、插值、GMM采样、CVAE采样和SMOTE五种方法，通过强化学习动态选择权重，采用矩匹配、直方图匹配等校准技术对齐边缘分布和保持特征依赖关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌和心脏病数据集上测试，Wasserstein距离低至0.001，KS统计量约0.01，成对趋势得分超过90%，下游分类器准确率达94%，F1分数超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展、隐私保护，在医疗数据合成中达到最先进水平，为敏感AI应用提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续领域自适应中无显式元数据时中间领域选择的挑战，现有研究对此探索不足

Method: 结合强化学习和特征解耦，利用潜在领域嵌入距离设计无监督奖励机制，通过解耦特征分别计算领域特定特征和领域不变特征

Result: 在Rotated MNIST和ADNI数据集上预测准确率和领域选择效率均有显著提升，优于传统CDA方法

Conclusion: 该集成策略能同时优化迁移路径和目标任务性能，提升领域自适应过程的有效性

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前基准测试不足以评估大语言模型强化学习的进展，因为训练集和测试集的性能差异很小，无法可靠区分进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL基准测试存在缺陷，训练集和测试集性能接近，无法有效评估模型的泛化能力。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标，通过压力测试分析RL方法的泛化能力。

Result: 现有RL方法在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下泛化能力差，但当前基准测试未能揭示这些缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出三个核心原则设计更可靠的基准测试：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中由于数据序列性破坏经典边界独立性假设而难以获得泛化保证的挑战。

Method: 推导了考虑马尔可夫依赖性的PAC-Bayesian泛化边界，并提出了PB-SAC算法，在训练过程中优化该边界来指导探索。

Result: 在连续控制任务上的实验表明，该方法提供了有意义的置信证书，同时保持了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为强化学习提供了考虑序列依赖性的泛化理论保证，并展示了理论边界在实际算法设计中的实用价值。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

<details>

Motivation: 传统通用时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性特征提取，难以捕捉与帕金森病高度相关的细微信号；PD症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征被传统聚合方法稀释

Method: 提出多尺度频率感知对抗多实例网络(MFAM)，包含基于医学先验知识的频率分解模块增强特征特异性，引入注意力机制的多实例学习框架自适应关注最具诊断价值的稀疏片段

Result: 在公共PADS数据集和私有数据集上验证，MFAM在PD与鉴别诊断二元分类和四类严重程度评估中均优于通用时间序列模型

Conclusion: MFAM为处理复杂临床时间序列提供有前景的解决方案，在帕金森病严重程度自动评估方面表现出色

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Motivation: 传统基于共识的联邦和去中心化学习策略在存在异构本地数据或任务分布时统计上不是最优的，现有多任务策略要么需要精确的先验任务关系知识，要么完全非参数化，需要在这两个极端之间找到平衡。

Method: 通过高斯马尔可夫随机场建模任务关系，使用未知精度矩阵，开发了一种联合学习任务关系和局部模型的策略，使智能体能够根据其个体数据分布自组织。

Result: 理论分析量化了学习到的任务关系的质量，数值实验证明了其实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法框架在传统共识方法和完全非参数方法之间取得了平衡，能够有效处理异构数据环境下的联邦学习问题。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该工作为自监督表示学习提供了理论基础，解释了对比损失的工作原理，并提出了改进自监督学习算法行为的方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

Conclusion: 组合对称性为深度模型的组合性优势提供了几何基础，并启发了基于对称性的预测编码框架。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有数据增强技术，分类准确率有显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen框架在有限数据约束下确保了数据多样性和可训练性，有效解决了EEG-BCI中的数据稀缺和个体差异问题。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

Method: 将中间模型探索问题形式化为在Lipschitz空间中对未知价值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果。

Conclusion: 本文为解决中间模型探索中的预算分配挑战提供了一个形式化的理论框架。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在表达能力和简单性之间取得良好平衡，为金融时间序列预测提供了有效的深度学习方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏置的成员推理攻击方法，通过KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，无需依赖参考模型，在仅知道模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒成员推理攻击方法依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。去除这些假设后，黑盒攻击性能显著下降。

Method: 利用神经网络的最大间隔隐式偏置理论，通过KKT最优性条件找到梯度最能重构模型参数的样本，从而识别训练样本。这是一种白盒攻击方法。

Result: ImpMIA在仅提供模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中，相比黑盒和白盒攻击方法都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 基于隐式偏置的ImpMIA方法消除了对参考模型的依赖，在现实场景中实现了更有效的成员推理攻击，表明白盒攻击在模型公开可用的环境下越来越具有现实意义。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

TL;DR: ProteinAE是一种新颖的蛋白质扩散自编码器，通过将蛋白质主链坐标从E(3)空间直接映射到连续紧凑的潜在空间，简化了蛋白质结构表示学习，并在重建质量和结构生成方面达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化需求或多训练目标等挑战，这些因素阻碍了模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 采用非等变扩散变换器，具有瓶颈设计以实现高效压缩，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练，简化优化流程。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，优于现有自编码器；其潜在空间为潜在扩散模型提供了强大基础，无需显式等变性，实现了高效高质量的结构生成。

Conclusion: ProteinAE通过简化的端到端训练框架，在蛋白质结构表示和生成方面取得了显著进展，为蛋白质科学提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: RetroTrim是一个逆合成系统，通过结合多种反应评分策略成功避免生成无意义的合成路径，在药物样靶标上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆合成生成模型存在产生无意义或错误输出（幻觉）的问题，而可靠的合成路径评估耗时且缺乏自动化方法。

Method: 结合基于机器学习模型和现有化学数据库的多样化反应评分策略，捕获不同类型的幻觉反应。

Result: RetroTrim是唯一能成功过滤幻觉反应的方法，在32个新型药物靶标上产生最多高质量合成路径。

Conclusion: 通过发布基准靶标和评估协议细节，希望推动可靠逆合成研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单状态关系，忽略了动态和静态股票关系之间的互补性

Method: 使用相对静态关系组件建模时变长期模式，通过距离感知机制捕获动态关系，并通过循环融合前一天动态关系与预定义静态关系来演化长期结构

Result: 在不同市场中显著优于基线方法，对关系强度与股价联动具有高敏感性

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的集成采样算法框架，用于非线性上下文多臂赌博机问题，包括GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种方法，分别针对广义线性模型和神经网络模型，提供了匹配最优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非线性上下文多臂赌博机算法在理论分析和实际应用方面存在局限性，需要开发既能提供理论保证又实用的随机探索方法。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种集成采样算法及其随时版本。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d^{3/2}√T + d^{9/2})，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，其中d是特征维度，˜d是神经正切核矩阵的有效维度。

Conclusion: 集成采样被确立为非线性上下文多臂赌博机中可证明且实用的随机探索方法，在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度的数据集自动选择最优网络深度，显著减少模型大小和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常采用过深的架构，导致不必要的计算开销、内存占用和能源消耗，特别是在复杂度较低的数据集上，这种过度设计使得模型难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似神经架构搜索的训练策略——渐进深度扩展，从较浅的深度开始训练网络，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加深度，直到达到目标精度，最终只保留最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持了99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够根据数据集复杂度自动选择最优网络深度，显著降低训练和推理成本，减少内存占用，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF微调扩散模型中训练使用的随机SDE采样器与推理使用的确定性ODE采样器之间的不匹配问题，这种差异会导致奖励差距，影响推理时的输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高水平的随机性，保持数据边际分布；通过理论分析给出奖励差距的非空边界，并对VE和VP高斯模型提供更尖锐的收敛率。

Result: 大规模文本到图像模型实验使用DDPO和MixGRPO验证：奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，当使用更高随机性的SDE训练更新模型时，ODE采样质量得到改善。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题可以通过理论分析和实验验证得到解决，高随机性SDE训练能有效提升确定性ODE推理的采样质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: BioOSS成功模拟了神经处理中关键的波状传播动态，为生物启发计算提供了新途径，在性能和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Motivation: 传统方法将可解释性应用于模型行为，而本文旨在通过剪枝机制更好地理解问题本身，识别时空问题中的关键元素。

Method: 开发了新颖模型，集成优化的剪枝机制，在训练过程中而非单独步骤中移除图节点，使架构能同时学习最小化预测误差和选择最相关节点。

Result: 在多个交通数据集上的实验表明，相比其他方法，该方法在图形缩小时能保留更多信息，获得更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 剪枝作为开发简化时空问题模型的有效工具，具有识别问题最重要元素的潜力。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

TL;DR: MARCD是一个结合了制度条件生成场景和CVaR分配器的投资组合决策框架，通过隐马尔可夫模型识别制度、扩散模型生成危机场景，在严格的前向测试中显著提升了夏普比率并降低了最大回撤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在制度转换环境下，通过制度条件的生成场景和凸CVaR分配器是否能改善投资组合决策，特别是在危机期间增强尾部风险控制。

Method: 提出MARCD方法：1) 使用高斯HMM推断潜在制度；2) 训练具有尾部加权目标和制度专业化MoE去噪器的扩散模型；3) 将生成场景输入考虑换手率的CVaR对偶二次规划。

Result: 在2005-2025年流动性多资产ETF的严格前向测试中，MARCD表现优于标准分配器，2020-2025年样本外测试显示夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个中间件框架，用于为包含特征和类别标签的机器学习数据集识别最优的掩码配置，通过最小化预测效用偏差来优化数据效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据共享生态系统中，由于隐私考虑，数据提供者通常会在共享前对数据集进行匿名化处理。但不同的掩码配置会导致数据效用差异，因此需要高效确定最优掩码配置以最大化数据集效用。

Method: 提出基于迭代比例拟合的联合分布估计器，利用有限的数据摘要（如1D直方图）或无数据来估计特征-标签联合分布，支持多种特征-标签相关性量化方法（g3、互信息、卡方检验）。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验评估表明，AEGIS识别最优掩码配置的速度比基线方法快一个数量级，同时生成的掩码数据集在下游机器学习任务中的预测性能与基线方法相当。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够在保护隐私的前提下，高效识别最优掩码配置，为数据共享生态系统中的隐私保护数据发布提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出GLANCE框架，通过轻量级路由器选择性调用LLM来优化GNN预测，在异构节点上实现显著性能提升，同时保持整体性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，整体性能提升有限。研究发现GNN和LLM在不同结构模式上表现各异，需要针对GNN易出错节点进行选择性融合。

Method: GLANCE框架包含轻量级路由器，基于廉价节点信号决定是否查询LLM。路由器采用基于优势的目标函数训练，比较调用LLM与仅依赖GNN的效用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLANCE在节点子组间实现最佳性能平衡，异构节点上性能提升高达13%，同时达到顶级整体性能。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可在大型图上实现可扩展部署，避免高计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Motivation: 连续状态扩散模型已有充分的理论研究，但离散状态扩散模型（用于文本、序列和组合结构）的理论理解严重不足，现有分析都假设分数估计误差界限而不研究样本复杂度。

Method: 提出了一个原则性的理论框架，将分数估计误差分解为统计、近似、优化和裁剪四个组成部分，系统分析离散状态扩散模型。

Result: 获得了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$的样本复杂度界限，这是离散状态扩散模型的第一个样本复杂度结果。

Conclusion: 该分析填补了文献中的基本空白，确立了离散状态扩散模型的理论可处理性和实际相关性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有的学习策略在单独训练时可能达到次优性能，特别是在缓存替换和预取这两个双向依赖的策略中，需要联合训练以提升整体性能。

Result: 初步结果显示两种方法都取得了有希望的结果，证明了联合学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为未来研究方向制定了议程，强调了联合学习在系统组件策略优化中的重要性。

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了图异质性（heterophily）与谱滤波器关系的传统观点，发现最优滤波器响应随频率分量变化，与异质性程度没有严格单调相关性，提出了自适应滤波器设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法简单地将低通滤波器用于同质图、高通滤波器用于异质图，但作者发现图异质性与谱滤波器的关系更为复杂，需要自适应滤波来保持图嵌入的表达能力。

Conclusion: 图异质性程度与GNN的平均频率响应不存在严格单调相关性，需要自适应图滤波器来保证良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布机器学习模型可能泄露隐私信息，需要量化这种风险并开发有效的隐私保护方法。

Method: 推导了梯度唯一性这一数学度量，该度量基于模型发布信息泄露的上界，不依赖模型架构、数据集类型或攻击策略假设。

Result: 基于梯度唯一性监控的简单防御机制在隐私保护效果上与DP-SGD相当，但在测试准确率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一个直观的隐私审计方法，其防御机制在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的基于VAE的时间序列异常检测方法存在单窗口特征限制，无法充分利用长期时间和频率信息，导致检测性能受限。

Method: 提出条件变分自编码器LPCVAE，引入LSTM捕获窗口外的长期依赖关系，采用专家乘积机制进行自适应分布级概率融合。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 将长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合相结合，为时间序列异常检测提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Conclusion: PerSyn验证了其有效性，并为未来研究提供了额外见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论框架，将经典信息论扩展到有限结构化系统，将冗余重新定义为信息组织的基本属性而非低效率。该框架将冗余表达为信息散度族，统一了互信息、卡方依赖和谱冗余等经典度量，揭示了它们共享的冗余几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典通信理论强调最小化冗余以提高传输效率，但现实世界中的有限结构化系统（如学习系统）在冗余平衡点附近达到最大稳定性和泛化能力。需要建立连接通信理论有限世界和学习有限世界的桥梁。

Method: 通过重新定义冗余为信息组织的基本属性，构建一个统一的信息散度框架，将多种经典信息度量统一在共享的几何原理下。使用掩码自编码器进行实验验证。

Result: 理论预测冗余存在上下界，产生最优平衡点，避免过度压缩（结构丢失）和过度耦合（崩溃）。实验显示模型在稳定冗余水平处泛化能力达到峰值。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调的量，能够连接通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界，为理解现实世界学习系统的稳定性和泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，通过动态调整熵正则化系数来解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，在多个数学推理基准测试中显著提升了推理准确性和探索能力。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线方法，显著提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能够有效解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，通过动态调整熵正则化系数实现更好的探索-利用平衡，提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: MC#是一个结合静态量化和动态专家剪枝的框架，通过PMQ优化位分配和OTP动态选择专家子集，实现对MoE-LLMs/VLMs的激进压缩，在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重减少和20%以上专家激活减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型中预加载所有专家和激活多个专家带来的显著计算和内存开销问题，专家模块是模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出MC#框架，结合静态量化(PMQ)和动态专家剪枝(OTP)。PMQ通过线性规划优化位分配，平衡专家重要性和量化误差；OTP使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上，MC#实现6.2倍权重减少，平均2.57位，五个多模态基准上仅1.7%精度下降；OTP减少20%以上专家激活，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过静态位宽优化和动态路由的结合，实现了极端压缩和最小精度损失，展示了高效部署MoE模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最优传输的自适应边界机制，用于增强Bradley-Terry奖励模型在相似偏好响应间的区分能力，提升模型的泛化性能和对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Bradley-Terry奖励模型在处理相似偏好响应时区分能力不足，容易过拟合简单样本，在分布外样本上泛化性能较差，导致大语言模型与人类偏好对齐效果不理想。

Method: 设计了一种自适应边界机制，通过语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异动态调整奖励模型的关注点，从分布角度利用最优传输理论构建成本矩阵，使模型能更好地区分选择和被拒绝响应的分布差异。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法优于现有奖励模型技术，在分布内和分布外设置下都表现出更好的性能，收敛速度更快，泛化能力更强。RLHF实验验证了其在更好对齐大语言模型与人类偏好方面的实际有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应边界机制有效解决了BT奖励模型在相似偏好区分和泛化方面的局限性，为提升大语言模型对齐性能提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

TL;DR: 4-bit量化在推理模型中并非最优选择，KV缓存比模型大小更占内存。研究发现存在规模依赖的权衡：小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应优先生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理模型中的内存优化策略，发现4-bit量化这一通用方法在推理模型中失效，需要规模感知的优化方法。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行了1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型在权重分配和生成长度之间的权衡。

Result: 发现8B参数是临界点：小模型（<8B）通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，大模型通过分配内存给更长生成长获得更好精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的内存优化需要与规模相关的策略，小模型优先模型容量，大模型优先测试时计算，这与非推理模型的优化策略完全不同。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Motivation: 在许多科学和工程应用中，当计算前向模型导数在计算和实际应用上具有挑战性时，无导数贝叶斯反演是一个重要任务。

Method: Blade利用基于扩散模型的数据驱动先验，通过交互粒子群产生准确且校准良好的后验分布，能够处理仅支持黑盒访问的非线性前向模型。

Result: 理论上建立了非渐近收敛分析来表征前向模型和先验估计误差的影响；实验上在包括高度非线性流体动力学在内的各种反问题上，Blade相比现有方法取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: Blade是一种有效的无导数贝叶斯反演方法，能够处理复杂非线性问题，在理论和实践中都表现出色。

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一个信息几何框架来量化表示效率，证明Barlow Twins方法在特定假设下能达到最优表示效率（η=1）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率。

Method: 引入信息几何框架，将表示效率η定义为学习表示空间的有效内在维度与环境维度的比值，其中有效维度来自编码器诱导的统计流形上Fisher信息矩阵的谱特性。

Result: 在特定自然假设下，证明Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵推向单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，达到最优表示效率（η=1）。

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能平衡数据效用与保护的方法。

Method: 在模型特定的低敏感子空间重新编码输入，保持授权模型输出不变，同时通过子空间错配降低未授权模型性能。使用Hoffman-Wielandt不等式将性能下降与谱差异联系起来。

Result: 实验表明NEs在多样化视觉骨干网络和最先进视觉语言模型上保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会性能崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，既能保持预期数据效用，又能防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Conclusion: 指令感知用户建模能够有效实现特定场景下指令引导的用户信息去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore框架，通过选择对抗性脆弱的样本（低平均输入梯度范数）来构建核心集，显著提升模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要针对干净准确率设计，无法有效保持对抗鲁棒性，需要从数据角度理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最关键。

Method: 将样本的对抗脆弱性与其"难度"关联，使用训练过程中的平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)量化样本难度，仅保留低AIGN的简单样本进行训练。

Result: 在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，EasyCore相比现有核心集方法分别实现了7%和5%的对抗准确率提升。

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心化方法，能够显著改善对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Motivation: 现有的保形预测方法要么忽略图拓扑结构，要么忽视时间动态性，无法在动态网络环境中提供可靠的不确定性量化。需要开发能够同时处理图结构和时间动态性的预测框架。

Method: 提出基于保形预测的顺序预测区域框架，专门针对图时间序列设计。关键技术创新是利用图结构捕获节点间的成对依赖关系，同时提供用户指定的覆盖保证。

Result: 正式证明该方案相对于忽略图结构的方法，能够实现椭球预测集体积的指数级缩小。在真实数据集上，该框架保持所需的经验覆盖度，同时比现有方法显著减小预测区域（最高减少80%）。

Conclusion: 该不确定性量化框架成功结合了图结构和时间动态性，在保持覆盖保证的同时显著提高了预测精度，为动态网络环境中的可信决策提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，通过Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，在极端多标签分类任务中实现显著的内存节省和计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端多标签分类(XMC)中，线性分类头成为计算和内存需求的主要驱动因素。现有FP16-FP32混合精度训练存在不稳定、内存使用和计算开销大的问题，而现有低精度方法通常为分类层保留更高精度。

Method: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8进行纯低精度训练，结合Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放。采用梯度融合和分块等内存优化技术。

Result: 在300万标签的XMC模型中，仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化SOTA方法Renee所需的39.7 GiB显著减少，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明XMC模型可以完全在Float8中有效训练，实现了显著的内存使用减少和计算效率提升。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

Result: TAG能持续产生与期望流形对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著提升生成质量

Conclusion: TAG是解决扩散模型离流形问题的通用方案，通过时间对齐引导有效改善生成保真度

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: EAGer是一种训练自由的生成方法，通过基于令牌熵分布来动态分配计算预算，减少冗余计算并提高推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同提示具有不同的复杂度，需要不同的计算量。当前方法对所有提示分配相同计算预算，造成资源浪费。

Method: 利用模型不确定性，通过令牌级熵分布来识别高熵令牌，仅在需要时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面达到最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，相比Full Parallel Sampling生成令牌减少65%，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过动态计算预算分配，有效提高了推理模型的效率和性能，为复杂推理任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: AT-GRPO是一种针对多智能体系统的强化学习方法，通过智能体和轮次分组优化，在游戏、规划、编程和数学任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习能增强大语言模型的能力，但将在线强化学习应用于多智能体系统仍存在挑战，包括算法层面的分组假设失效和系统层面的训练支持不足。

Method: 提出了AT-GRPO方法，包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统的智能体和轮次分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略模型的训练系统。

Result: 在长期规划任务中，准确率从14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；编程任务平均提升3.87-7.62%；数学任务平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体系统中有效解决了在线强化学习的挑战，显著提升了各种任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and
environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.

TL;DR: ENIGMA是一种新颖的LLM训练方法，通过将组织政策视为信息流形上的方向，联合提升推理、对齐和鲁棒性。该方法结合了GRPO强化学习、SAMI互信息辅助和Sinkhorn正则化，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM训练中推理、对齐和鲁棒性分离的问题，提出这些能力是单一信息几何目标的不同投影，通过信息流形上的方向移动来统一优化。

Method: 单循环训练器结合：GRPO（无评论家的策略优化）+ SAMI风格的对称InfoNCE辅助 + Sinkhorn最优传输正则化。引入Sufficiency Index指标预先选择能最大化下游性能的原则。

Result: 在1B参数LLM上的实验表明，高SI原则预测更稳定的训练动态和更好的基准性能。信息几何分析验证了流形上的理想结构变化。

Conclusion: ENIGMA支持了推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标投影的假设，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理，为可信能力提供路径。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向边缘设备的单实例测试时自适应方法TED，使用CMA-ES在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，无需反向传播，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备计算资源有限且面临分布偏移，现有测试时自适应方法依赖梯度优化或批处理，不适合资源受限的边缘场景。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，通过更新紧凑的低维向量来增强输出置信度并使潜在表示更接近源分布。

Result: 在ImageNet和Google Speech Commands数据集上的实验表明，TED达到最先进性能，计算复杂度降低高达63倍，并在ZYNQ-7020平台上成功部署。

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，在真实世界边缘应用中具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook是一个基于视觉的强化学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型(MLLM)实现前端代码的生成-诊断-优化循环，显著提升了前端开发代码生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要通过渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 采用代理式、基于视觉的强化学习框架，利用MLLM作为视觉批评器进行代码评分和提供可操作的视觉反馈，引入强制优化规则确保单调改进。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在基于视觉的前端代码生成方面始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明代理感知、视觉奖励以及训练-推理解耦在前端代码生成中具有显著优势。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

TL;DR: 提出CDRL4AD方法，通过因果解缠表示学习来检测多元时间序列中的异常并识别其因果关系，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中变量间的动态交互使因果关系解释复杂化，现有方法无法显式推断不同时间段的因果关系。

Method: 设计时间异构图和因果过程作为模型输入，通过表示学习识别不同时间段的因果关系并解缠潜在变量以推断因果因子。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于最先进方法，模型分析验证了超参数敏感性和时间复杂度。

Conclusion: CDRL4AD能有效检测异常并识别因果关系，案例研究显示该方法有助于人类专家诊断异常根因。

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BGPO算法，通过构建特殊的ELBO下界来解决扩散大语言模型RL训练中的内存瓶颈问题，实现了常数内存使用和更精确的似然近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散大语言模型的RL训练中，由于需要保留所有蒙特卡洛样本的前向计算图用于梯度计算，导致显著的内存开销，限制了样本数量，从而影响似然近似的精度和RL目标的有效性。

Method: 提出边界引导策略优化(BGPO)，通过构建满足线性和等价性两个关键性质的特殊ELBO下界，实现跨样本的梯度累积和常数内存使用。

Result: BGPO在数学问题解决、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的RL算法设计，解决了扩散大语言模型RL训练中的内存瓶颈问题，实现了更准确的似然近似和更好的性能表现。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: PhysioME是一个针对生理信号多模态缺失问题的鲁棒框架，通过自监督学习和模态恢复机制，在模态缺失情况下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生理信号应用中因硬件限制或运动伪影导致的模态缺失问题，现有方法在模态缺失时性能显著下降。

Method: 采用多模态自监督学习（对比学习+掩码预测）、双路径神经网络主干和恢复解码器来重构缺失模态。

Result: 在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有望成为现实临床环境中数据不完整情况下的可靠决策支持工具。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，加速LLM的RL训练，减少内存开销，并利用量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练LLM需要大量GPU内存和长时间rollout，资源消耗大，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，引入自适应量化噪声(AQN)机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声。

Result: 在rollout阶段获得1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在GSM8K(90.8%)和MATH 500(77.4%)等数学基准上达到全参数微调性能。

Conclusion: QeRL是LLM强化学习训练的高效有效框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Method: 采用多层级课程奖励函数，逐步引导LLM生成可编译、可执行且性能优越的交叉算子，结合算子缓存机制防止抄袭并促进多样性。

Conclusion: 专用小型LLM经过适当微调可以超越大型通用模型和专家设计，为组合优化问题提供更高效的启发式设计解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在挑战性光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统跨模态方法计算昂贵或产生结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏(MLCM-KD)框架，包含双向注入知识蒸馏(DIKD)机制，建立RGB和热成像模态间的连接，通过闭环监督学习模态不变特征。

Result: 在公共热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: MLCM-KD框架成功解决了热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现了高效准确的知识迁移，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型性能在分布偏移下下降的主要原因是模型依赖与预测目标没有直接因果关系的特征。

Method: 应用数据增强保留因果特征但改变非因果特征，通过主成分分析识别非因果特征的高方差方向，修剪表示中的这些方向投影。

Result: TACT在真实世界分布外基准测试中显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过识别和去除表示中的非因果成分可以有效提高模型在测试时的适应能力。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: 通过显式考虑核多样性并平衡其与个体测试能力的关系，提出的方法显著提升了多核测试的性能。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法缺乏系统性的跨领域评估，需要建立统一的评估框架来比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 构建模块化流水线，集成预处理（归一化、STL分解）、四种预测模型、四种检测方法，使用残差检测接口，在Numenta异常基准测试上进行完整评估。

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1：0.688，在81%数据集上排名第一或第二），Informer提供竞争性精度（F1：0.683）且训练速度快30%，传统方法在简单合成数据上完美预测但真实世界数据表现较差。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议根据场景选择：复杂模式用LSTM，效率关键部署用Informer，资源受限的简单周期性数据用传统方法。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

TL;DR: 强化学习(RL)和监督学习(SL)在相同决策任务中驱动循环神经网络(RNNs)产生根本不同的计算策略：RL自发发现混合吸引子架构，而SL主要收敛到简单的固定点解。

Motivation: 探索学习算法本身如何影响神经网络中涌现的计算策略，特别是比较RL和SL在相同任务中产生的动态特性差异。

Method: 通过系统动力学分析，训练RNNs在相同决策任务上，比较RL和SL产生的吸引子架构和神经群体特征。

Result: RL发现混合吸引子架构（稳定固定点+准周期吸引子），具有功能平衡的神经群体和更强的鲁棒性；SL主要产生固定点解，神经群体更异质。

Conclusion: 学习算法是涌现计算的主要决定因素，基于奖励的优化能自主发现复杂动态机制，为设计自适应AI系统提供指导原则。

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个源代码函数为易受攻击，无法精确定位具体漏洞代码行，这限制了在软件开发过程中为人类操作者提供有效支持。

Method: 提出检测对齐(DA)方法，量化模型预测中最影响预测的输入代码行与真实漏洞位置之间的一致性，该方法与模型无关，可适应不同的检测任务。

Conclusion: 现有漏洞检测模型存在严重的偏差问题，检测对齐方法能有效评估模型预测与真实漏洞位置的一致性，为改进漏洞检测模型提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为神经权重压缩（NWC）的学习压缩框架，专门用于语言模型权重的压缩，通过自动编码器架构和三个关键技术组件，在4-6位精度下实现了与FP16模型相当的准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 语言模型权重的规模和采用持续增长，但当前对这类数据模态的理解有限，设计压缩算法主要依赖手动试错方法，需要更智能的压缩解决方案。

Method: 基于自动编码器的神经编解码器，包含三个关键技术：列向张量分块和归一化、重要性感知训练损失、基于模型输出的推理时误差补偿机制。

Result: 在开源语言模型上的实验表明，NWC在精度-压缩权衡方面达到竞争性或最先进水平，特别是在4-6位精度下，准确性几乎与FP16模型相当。

Conclusion: NWC框架为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习压缩方法，克服了传统压缩方法在处理语言模型权重时的局限性。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Conclusion: SCGL为从信号数据中学习连接图提供了一个原则性框架，在多个指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 现实图中节点常缺乏信息丰富的特征向量，仅能利用邻域连接性和类别标签，需要学习能捕捉结构角色和拓扑上下文的节点嵌入。

Method: 联合优化三个互补目标：基于可扩展模块度近似的无监督结构保持、最小化标记节点类内方差的监督正则化、基于随机游走和注意力加权相似度的半监督标签传播。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，分类准确率与最先进方法相当或更优，同时计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理缺乏节点特征的图数据，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Conclusion: 自监督自动编码器是处理临床数据标签稀缺和异构性问题的有前景解决方案，特别是在无标签数据可用性可能增加的条件下。

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Conclusion: 该方法在异构数据场景下有效提升了全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适应能力，实现了全局和局部层面的协同优化。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Conclusion: ST-Vision-LLM通过视觉-语言融合方法有效解决了时空交通预测中的空间依赖建模挑战，证明了其在精度和泛化能力方面的优越性。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

TL;DR: DiffTSST是一个基于扩散模型的时序数据风格迁移框架，通过卷积编码器分离时序数据的风格和内容表示，并使用自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合，实现有效的风格迁移和数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前风格迁移方法在视觉和语言领域发展成熟，但在时序数据领域仍然有限。时序风格迁移能够支持数据增强和场景模拟，帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域实现更好的泛化能力。

Method: 使用卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合这些表示。在推理时，从两个不同序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以实现风格迁移。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格迁移。在数据稀缺场景下，使用DiffTSST进行数据增强能够改善异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST为时序数据风格迁移提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过扩散模型实现了内容和风格的解耦与重组，在数据增强和异常检测等实际应用中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: 提出EVP框架，通过事件感知的动态图提示学习增强现有方法利用历史事件知识的能力


<details>

Motivation: 现有动态图学习方法主要关注节点与时间的关系，但忽视了历史事件的影响

Method: 1) 为每个节点提取历史事件序列并引入事件适应机制；2) 提出事件聚合机制将历史知识整合到节点表示中

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验评估和分析

Conclusion: EVP可作为现有方法的插件，有效增强其利用历史事件知识的能力

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的同步强化学习后训练系统存在资源利用率低和可扩展性有限的问题，需要更高效的训练架构。

Method: 基于细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦两大设计原则，提供灵活的编程接口，支持完全异步训练架构和高效的rollout机制。

Result: 在相同GPU预算下，ROLL Flash在RLVR任务上实现2.24倍加速，在智能体任务上实现2.72倍加速，异步训练性能与同步训练相当。

Conclusion: ROLL Flash通过异步训练架构显著提升了强化学习后训练的效率，为大规模语言模型的能力增强提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

TL;DR: 提出多视图特征传播(MFP)框架，通过将特征分成多个高斯噪声视图独立传播，在特征稀疏情况下提升节点分类性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在真实场景中面临的特征稀疏和隐私泄露问题，传统方法在特征不完整时性能下降且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播，将可用特征划分为多个添加高斯噪声的视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，然后聚合生成鲁棒的节点嵌入。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有基线方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露。传播输出作为原始特征的替代插补而非重建。

Conclusion: MFP为具有缺失或敏感特征的图学习领域提供了一个有效且隐私感知的框架，在保持实用性的同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

TL;DR: 本文首次理论分析了批量大小对Adam优化器泛化性能的影响，发现在过参数化CNN中，小批量Adam可以取得接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本会收敛到较差的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析Adam的全批量版本，这与实践中使用的随机版本存在根本差异。随机Adam即使使用极小学习率也不会收敛到全批量对应版本，需要理解批量大小如何影响Adam的泛化性能。

Method: 在两层的过参数化CNN上理论分析Adam和AdamW的泛化行为，比较不同批量大小下的性能差异，并推导有效权重衰减界限。

Result: 实验验证了理论发现：小批量Adam和AdamW可以取得接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本收敛到较差的解。Adam的有效权重衰减界限严格小于AdamW，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的权重衰减调参。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起关键作用，小批量训练可以显著改善Adam的泛化能力，而Adam比AdamW需要更精细的权重衰减调参。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何表示和处理医学知识，为医学任务的微调、遗忘或去偏提供指导。

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：UMAP投影中间激活、基于梯度的显著图、层切除/移除和激活修补。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在前半层处理，年龄编码非线性且不连续，疾病进展表示非单调且循环，药物按医学专科而非作用机制聚类，某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医学任务的LLMs微调、遗忘或去偏技术提供层级的应用指导。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

Motivation: 级联排序在大规模信息检索系统中广泛应用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不对齐或梯度冲突问题，且时间复杂度较高。

Conclusion: 这是首个将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统的工作，也是首个实现理论最优线性时间复杂度的Top-K选择方法。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中显著降低计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了整数重新缩放操作的影响，这在整数AI推理中是硬件成本高昂的操作。

Method: 提出后训练应用更强量化到重新缩放乘数的方法，并引入重新缩放感知训练，对超低比特宽度的重新缩放乘数进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，即使重新缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重新训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的嵌入式系统实现了更节能和成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

*Xinsong Feng,Leshu Tang,Chenan Wang,Haipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出生成轨迹策略(GTP)，通过统一视角将扩散、流匹配和一致性模型视为ODE控制的生成轨迹特例，在离线强化学习中实现高性能与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在离线强化学习中面临性能与效率的权衡：扩散策略计算昂贵，一致性策略性能较差，需要找到平衡两者的方法。

Method: 将现代生成模型统一为ODE控制的连续时间生成轨迹，提出GTP学习底层ODE的完整解映射，并引入两个理论原则性适配。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于先前生成策略，在多个困难的AntMaze任务中获得完美分数。

Conclusion: GTP通过统一ODE视角成功弥合了生成模型在离线RL中的性能-效率差距，为生成策略提供了更清晰的设计空间。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于模型的强化学习算法在自动驾驶赛车环境中的泛化能力，提出了上下文感知的cMask方法，相比上下文无关方法能更好地处理分布外对手行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要能够泛化到未见场景的算法，而现有的基于模型强化学习算法对环境变化敏感，在对抗性环境中泛化能力不足。

Method: 将头对头赛车任务建模为上下文马尔可夫决策过程，使用情景参数化对手驾驶行为，提出上下文感知的cMask扩展方法。

Result: 上下文感知的MBRL算法在分布外对手行为上比上下文无关方法泛化更好，cMask在分布内对手行为上也表现出更强的泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的基于模型强化学习方法能有效提升自动驾驶赛车任务中的泛化能力，cMask方法在对抗性环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

TL;DR: MISTAKE方法利用循环一致性构建高质量的错误推理示例，用于学习学生模拟、错误概念分类和答案生成模型，在教育任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中的错误推理模式，为教育应用如课堂实时反馈和教师培训提供自动化系统支持。

Method: 通过错误答案与潜在错误概念之间的循环一致性构建合成示例，并利用生成数据学习相关模型。

Result: 在三个教育任务中，MISTAKE方法在学生模拟准确性、错误概念推断性能和错误答案生成对齐度方面均有提升。

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法能有效建模错误推理模式，在教育应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

*Aleksei Rozanov,Samikshya Subedi,Vasudha Sharma,Bryan C. Runck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究结合基于树的机器学习方法和知识引导特征，利用多光谱遥感数据、网格气象数据和涡度协方差数据，在美国中西部地区实现了高精度蒸散发估算，开发了500米空间分辨率和一天时间分辨率的蒸散发数据产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蒸散发在陆气相互作用中至关重要，但现有现场测量方法（如涡度协方差）只能获取单点数据，无法满足农业应用中对大面积区域每个田块蒸散发估算的需求。

Method: 比较了四种基于树的模型（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost、LightGBM）和简单前馈神经网络，结合知识引导机器学习原则构建的特征，使用k折交叉验证和站点-年份、生物群系分层训练测试分割来避免数据泄露。

Result: LightGBM结合知识引导特征表现最佳，R²=0.86，MSE=14.99 W m⁻²，MAE=8.82 W m⁻²。特征重要性分析显示知识引导特征对预测蒸散发最重要。

Conclusion: 成功开发了2019-2024年期间500米空间分辨率和一天时间分辨率的网格化蒸散发数据产品，与州级气象站蒸散发估算相比表现出最佳对应关系。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

*Yuchen Yan,Zhihua Liu,Hao Wang,Weiming Li,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于图表示学习的多跳问题检索框架，通过多信息级别知识图谱和查询特定图神经网络来解决多跳问题中的语义理解和噪声干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，现有RAG方法难以理解复杂语义结构，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Method: 首先构建多信息级别知识图谱(Multi-L KG)，然后设计查询特定图神经网络(QSGNN)，采用查询引导的层级内/间消息传递机制，并使用两种合成数据生成策略进行预训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在多跳场景中表现优异，特别是在高跳问题中改进可达33.8%。

Conclusion: 该图表示学习框架能有效提升多跳问题检索性能，显著减少噪声影响，在高跳问题上表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的决策聚焦学习方法，通过扩散模型表示不确定参数的分布，并用采样进行随机优化，在决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策聚焦学习方法通常依赖确定性点预测，无法充分捕捉现实环境中的随机性，需要更好的不确定性建模方法。

Method: 使用扩散模型表示参数分布，通过重参数化技巧实现端到端训练；并提出轻量级得分函数估计器，避免在采样过程中反向传播。

Result: 实验表明，该扩散DFL方法在决策质量上持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为决策聚焦学习提供了有效的概率建模框架，提出的轻量级训练方法在保持性能的同时降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合学习注意力因子和套利交易策略的框架，通过条件潜在因子识别相似资产和错误定价，在考虑交易成本后实现风险调整后的最大收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统计套利利用相似资产间的暂时价格差异获利，但传统方法在识别相似资产、错误定价和交易策略优化方面存在分离处理的局限性。

Method: 开发注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互，使用序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号，并联合估计因子和套利交易策略。

Result: 在24年期间对美国最大股票的回测显示，注意力因子模型实现了超过4的样本外夏普比率，考虑交易成本后的单步解决方案获得了前所未有的2.3夏普比率。

Conclusion: 联合估计因子和交易策略对于在交易成本后最大化盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文指出当前强化学习微调方法在数学推理上只是强化已有能力而非发现新技能，为此提出了MATH-B基准来挑战现有模型，推动探索性强化学习方法的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理上只是优化已有解题模式，而非真正探索新技能，这与强化学习的探索本质相悖。需要构建更具挑战性的基准来推动方法创新。

Method: 构建MATH-B基准，从DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集中选取现有开源模型即使在大采样预算下也无法解决的数学问题。

Result: 现有强化学习微调模型（如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview）在MATH-B基准上表现不佳，即使在pass@1024采样下也无法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准能够有效评估强化学习方法的探索能力，希望它能推动开发真正能够发现新推理技能的强化学习方法。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机过程诱导的生成模型流，特别是寻找能够产生直线流的过程，这些流具有零加速度特性，可以用一阶方法精确积分。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的期望速度定义ODE，提出直线流的PDE特征化方法，研究条件加速度与加权协方差张量散度之间的平衡关系。

Result: 完全刻画了仿射时间插值过程，证明直线性仅在确定性端点耦合下发生，并为一般过程推导了约束流几何的必要条件。

Conclusion: 为设计更易积分的传输过程提供了广泛指导，揭示了直线流与确定性端点耦合之间的精确对应关系。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除预测任务中的前瞻偏差，确保模型训练数据与预测时间严格分离，为研究提供无偏差的生成式AI工具。

Method: 训练仅使用截止日期前数据的指令跟随大语言模型，采用固定的模型权重保证可复现性，提供简单的对话界面。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在语言模型强化学习中引入基于表示的探索奖励机制，通过在预训练模型的隐藏状态中提取多样性奖励，显著提升了推理任务的多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前强化学习技术是否真正促进语言模型发现新行为，还是仅仅优化已有行为，探索预训练模型知识如何指导搜索过程。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的简单、原则化的表示多样性奖励机制，在训练后和推理时两个阶段实施探索策略。

Conclusion: 通过正确的多样性概念进行有意识的探索，是实现超越简单优化的新行为发现的实际可行路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了现有遗憾分析，证明了社交和个体遗憾上界可达O(√log m log n)，并提供了匹配的算法依赖下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强解耦学习动态中的遗憾依赖m和n的最优性，现有遗憾上界为O(log(mn))，但可能不是最优的。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和负项系数的优化问题，进行精细化分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界来证明上界的最优性。

Result: 在强解耦设置下，社交和个体遗憾上界改进为O(√log m log n)；证明了现有社交遗憾上界和新的上界都无法进一步改进，上下界在主导项常数上完全匹配。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge算法的遗憾依赖m和n的最优性得到完整刻画，基于这些结果改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了匹配的动态遗憾下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

TL;DR: 该论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络用更少的维度表示更多特征），攻击者可以利用这种特征排列进行攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对抗性样本产生的根本原因，挑战了将其视为决策边界不规则性或非鲁棒特征敏感性的传统观点，提出从信息编码角度解释对抗性漏洞。

Method: 通过精确控制叠加的合成设置验证叠加现象足以产生对抗性漏洞，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中验证这些发现。

Result: 证明对抗性扰动利用了叠加特征之间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测，解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类特定漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合摊销方法和粒子方法的采样策略，通过连接序列蒙特卡洛和最大熵强化学习来训练神经采样器，并引入了离策略训练、自适应权重退火等技术来提升采样效果和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的摊销采样方法在复杂多峰分布上表现不佳，而传统蒙特卡洛方法计算成本高。本文旨在结合两种方法的优势，通过强化学习训练神经采样器来更有效地从非归一化密度函数中采样。

Method: 1. 建立SMC与MaxEnt RL的连接，将学习到的采样策略和价值函数分别作为提议核和扭曲函数；2. 引入离策略RL训练过程，使用SMC样本作为行为策略；3. 开发联合训练提议和扭曲函数的技术；4. 采用自适应权重退火方案减少训练信号方差；5. 结合历史样本与退火重要性采样权重。

Result: 在合成多峰目标（连续和离散空间）和丙氨酸二肽构象的玻尔兹曼分布上，相比摊销方法和蒙特卡洛方法，在逼近真实分布和训练稳定性方面都表现出改进。

Conclusion: 通过结合摊销和粒子方法，并利用SMC与强化学习的连接，提出的方法能够更有效地从复杂分布中采样，同时在训练稳定性和分布逼近精度上优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过降噪和Lasso估计线性条件平均处理效应(CATE)的新方法，在随机实验中提高估计精度和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆概率加权(IPW)转换的结果存在噪声问题，即使使用真实倾向得分，这影响了CATE估计的准确性

Method: 采用IPW进行识别，引入降噪程序，使用Lasso估计线性CATE模型，结合准确性和可解释性

Result: 理论证明降噪能减少Lasso的预测误差；在Get-Out-the-Vote和Criteo数据集上，该方法在识别高处理效应个体方面优于非参数机器学习方法

Conclusion: 该方法在处理效应相对于结果变异性较小时特别有效，能发现与先前实证发现一致的有信息异质性模式

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) in randomized experiments. We adopt inverse probability
weighting (IPW) for identification; however, IPW-transformed outcomes are known
to be noisy, even when true propensity scores are used. To address this issue,
we introduce a noise reduction procedure and estimate a linear CATE model using
Lasso, achieving both accuracy and interpretability. We theoretically show that
denoising reduces the prediction error of the Lasso. The method is particularly
effective when treatment effects are small relative to the variability of
outcomes, which is often the case in empirical applications. Applications to
the Get-Out-the-Vote dataset and Criteo Uplift Modeling dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms fully nonparametric machine learning methods in
identifying individuals with higher treatment effects. Moreover, our method
uncovers informative heterogeneity patterns that are consistent with previous
empirical findings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于二元处理和二元工具变量设置下分类结果因果推断的非参数框架，通过分解观测概率为潜在结果边际概率和关联参数，在关联相似性假设下实现点识别，并提供两种弱化假设的偏识别方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在二元处理和二元工具变量设置下，对分类结果进行因果推断时，需要处理由未观测异质性引起的选择偏差问题。

Method: 将观测的联合概率分解为潜在结果的边际概率和关联参数，提出关联相似性假设实现点识别，并提供单调关联和有界关联两种弱化假设进行偏识别。

Result: 在关联相似性假设下实现潜在结果全分布的点识别，在弱化假设下获得尖锐的偏识别边界，并通过健康保险对健康结果的实证应用验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为分类结果的因果推断提供了灵活的非参数方法，能够在不同强度假设下进行识别和敏感性分析。

Abstract: This paper provides a nonparametric framework for causal inference with
categorical outcomes under binary treatment and binary instrument settings. We
decompose the observed joint probability of outcomes and treatment into
marginal probabilities of potential outcomes and treatment, and association
parameters that capture selection bias due to unobserved heterogeneity. Under a
novel identifying assumption, association similarity, which requires the
dependence between unobserved factors and potential outcomes to be invariant
across treatment states, we achieve point identification of the full
distribution of potential outcomes. Recognizing that this assumption may be
strong in some contexts, we propose two weaker alternatives: monotonic
association, which restricts the direction of selection heterogeneity, and
bounded association, which constrains its magnitude. These relaxed assumptions
deliver sharp partial identification bounds that nest point identification as a
special case and facilitate transparent sensitivity analysis. We illustrate the
framework in an empirical application, estimating the causal effect of private
health insurance on health outcomes.

TL;DR: 该论文通过整合高维数据、正则化、严格样本外验证和非线性建模三个关键原则，来预测宏观经济结果的全条件分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用宏观经济和金融预测因子中的丰富信息，实时准确预测宏观经济风险的完整分布。

Method: 使用高维数据配合适当的正则化（收缩方法），采用严格的样本外验证程序，并引入非线性建模。

Result: 正则化对于控制模型复杂性至关重要，而非线性建模对预测准确性的提升有限。样本外验证在选择模型架构和防止过拟合方面发挥关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过系统整合高维数据、正则化和样本外验证，能够有效预测宏观经济风险分布，其中正则化和验证程序比非线性建模更为重要。

Abstract: We forecast the full conditional distribution of macroeconomic outcomes by
systematically integrating three key principles: using high-dimensional data
with appropriate regularization, adopting rigorous out-of-sample validation
procedures, and incorporating nonlinearities. By exploiting the rich
information embedded in a large set of macroeconomic and financial predictors,
we produce accurate predictions of the entire profile of macroeconomic risk in
real time. Our findings show that regularization via shrinkage is essential to
control model complexity, while introducing nonlinearities yields limited
improvements in predictive accuracy. Out-of-sample validation plays a critical
role in selecting model architecture and preventing overfitting.

TL;DR: 开发了一个统一框架来识别空间双重差分设计中处理效应的时空边界，基于流体动力学方程推导出处理效应在时空上呈指数衰减的条件，并通过空气污染案例验证了该框架的诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间双重差分研究缺乏对处理效应边界的理论指导，无法确定效应在何处变得不可检测，需要从物理学第一原理出发建立严格的边界检测框架。

Method: 从纳维-斯托克斯方程出发，推导处理效应在空间和时间上指数衰减的条件，涵盖线性和非线性机制，基于无量纲物理数（佩克莱数和雷诺数）建立可检验的范围条件。

Result: 在西部美国分析791个PM2.5监测点和189,564个NO2卫星网格，发现煤炭电厂100公里内污染物呈正空间衰减，验证了框架有效性；超过100公里时负衰减参数正确表明城市源主导且扩散假设失效。

Conclusion: 该框架在8个分析区域中的4个成功诊断了自身有效性，为研究者提供了基于物理学的工具来评估空间双重差分设置是否满足扩散假设，证明了严格边界检测需要理论推导和实证验证的结合。

Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal
boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting
from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions
under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling
researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become
undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and
nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable
scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and
Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using
air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based
PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the
Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity:
within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay
(PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s =
0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative
decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion
assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as
satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The
framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed
regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their
spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions
before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary
detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and
empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.

*Mohammad Zeqi Yasin*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Do industrial "superstars" help others up or crowd them out? We examine the
relationship between the spillovers of superstar firms (those with the top
market share in their industry) and the productivity dynamics in Indonesia.
Employing data on Indonesian manufacturing firms from 2001 to 2015, we find
that superstar exposures in the market raise both the productivity level and
the growth of non-superstar firms through horizontal (within a sector-province)
and vertical (across sectors) channels. When we distinguish by ownership,
foreign superstars consistently encourage productivity except through the
horizontal channel. In contrast, domestic superstars generate positive
spillovers through both horizontal and vertical linkages, indicating that
foreign firms do not solely drive positive externalities. Furthermore, despite
overall productivity growth being positive in 2001-2015, the source of negative
growth is mainly driven by within-group reallocation, evidence of misallocation
among surviving firms, notably by domestic superstars. Although Indonesian
superstar firms are more efficient in their operations, their relatively modest
growth rates suggest a potential stagnation, which can be plausibly attributed
to limited innovation activity or a slow pace of adopting new technologies.

*Onil Boussim*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了成分差分法(CoDiD)，用于处理分类结果的DID分析，解决了线性DID模型在分类数据中的问题，如尺度依赖性和负反事实量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性DID模型在处理分类结果时存在问题：尺度依赖性、可能产生负反事实量、与离散选择理论不一致。需要一种更适合分类数据的方法。

Method: 基于平行增长假设，假设在没有处理的情况下，各分类在实验组和对照组中以相同比例增长或收缩。在随机效用框架下，这对应于任何一对分类的相对偏好平行演化。

Result: 开发了CoDiD方法，能够识别反事实分类数量、总水平和份额。扩展了方法以处理放松假设下的边界、交错采用，并提出了合成DID类似物。

Conclusion: CoDiD为分类结果的DID分析提供了更合适的方法，通过两个实证应用（早期投票改革和区域温室气体倡议）展示了其经验相关性。

Abstract: In difference-in-differences (DiD) settings with categorical outcomes,
treatment effects often operate on both total quantities (e.g., voter turnout)
and category shares (e.g., vote distribution across parties). In this context,
linear DiD models can be problematic: they suffer from scale dependence, may
produce negative counterfactual quantities, and are inconsistent with discrete
choice theory. We propose compositional DiD (CoDiD), a new method that
identifies counterfactual categorical quantities, and thus total levels and
shares, under a parallel growths assumption. The assumption states that, absent
treatment, each category's size grows or shrinks at the same proportional rate
in treated and control groups. In a random utility framework, we show that this
implies parallel evolution of relative preferences between any pair of
categories. Analytically, we show that it also means the shares are reallocated
in the same way in both groups in the absence of treatment. Finally,
geometrically, it corresponds to parallel trajectories (or movements) of
probability mass functions of the two groups in the probability simplex under
Aitchison geometry. We extend CoDiD to i) derive bounds under relaxed
assumptions, ii) handle staggered adoption, and iii) propose a synthetic DiD
analog. We illustrate the method's empirical relevance through two
applications: first, we examine how early voting reforms affect voter choice in
U.S. presidential elections; second, we analyze how the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI) affected the composition of electricity generation across
sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables.
