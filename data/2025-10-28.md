### [2] [Policy Optimization Prefers The Path of Least Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21853)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aakash Sen Sharma,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 政策优化在开放式的思维链结构中倾向于选择最简单路径，丢弃显式推理，直接输出答案，即使复杂格式被赋予更高奖励权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政策优化在放松严格"思考-回答"格式约束后的行为，探索开放式思维链结构下的优化特性。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验和奖励分解实验，验证政策优化在不同模型和算法中的行为模式。

Result: 政策优化始终遵循最小阻力路径，即使复杂格式奖励权重高达4倍，仍会退化到仅输出答案的简单格式。

Conclusion: 给予政策优化自由度是一把双刃剑：既能发现高奖励捷径，也容易导致奖励函数被简单利用，这对对齐任务构成挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

### [3] [Language Ranker: A Lightweight Ranking framework for LLM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21883)
*Chenheng Zhang,Tianqi Du,Jizhe Zhang,Mingqing Xiao,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Language Ranker框架，将LLM解码过程重新定义为推荐系统中的排序阶段，通过轻量级重排模块提升生成质量，在性能媲美大型奖励模型的同时大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注输出分布优化，忽视了将分布转化为最终响应的解码过程。现有方法如奖励模型计算成本高且适用性有限，存在冗余问题。

Method: 将解码过程类比推荐系统排序阶段，提出Language Ranker框架，使用基础模型提取特征，通过轻量级模块（<0.5M参数）对候选响应进行重排。

Result: 在广泛任务上的实验表明，Language Ranker性能与大规模奖励模型相当，同时显著降低训练和推理阶段的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，充分释放了LLM的潜力，展示了轻量级重排方法在解码过程中的优势。

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

### [4] [Framework for Machine Evaluation of Reasoning Completeness in Large Language Models For Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21884)
*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性之间的对齐度，发现正确预测更支持特征，错误预测更矛盾特征，揭示了LLM解释的忠实性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对透明可解释AI的需求日益增长，但LLM生成的自然语言解释是否忠实反映预测信号尚不明确。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过token感知、精确字符串和编辑距离匹配技术，在四个文本分类数据集上比较LLM解释与逻辑回归特征重要性。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测覆盖更多支持特征，错误预测覆盖更多矛盾特征；编辑距离匹配发现释义重叠，增强覆盖度但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表面和灵活的证据重用，但在错误情况下会放大误导线索；RACE为评估神经语言模型推理完整性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

### [5] [Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting: Behavior-Aware Sampling for Safer Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21885)
*Anh Pham,Mihir Thalanki,Michael Sun,Aditya Chaloo,Ankita Gupta,Tian Xia,Aditya Mate,Ehimwenma Nosakhare,Soundararajan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性选择安全示例，显著减少有害输出同时保持帮助性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现41%有害性降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在良性数据上微调时经常失去之前对齐的安全行为，这种现象称为灾难性遗忘。现有研究表明添加随机安全示例可以缓解此问题，但尚不清楚哪些示例最有效。

Method: 提出行为感知采样框架，基于两个互补因素选择安全示例：指令-响应行为（如拒绝与服从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性。

Result: 系统评估显示该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持帮助性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现高达41%的有害性降低。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了目标数据选择如何在大规模微调中提高安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

### [6] [Embedding Trust: Semantic Isotropy Predicts Nonfactuality in Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21891)
*Dhrupad Bhardwaj,Julia Kempe,Tim G. J. Rudner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出语义各向同性概念，通过分析文本嵌入在单位球面上的分布均匀性来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，无需标注数据或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要准确回答开放性问题的高风险应用领域部署LLM时，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估长文本响应的可信度，现有基于逐项事实核查的方法计算昂贵且脆弱。

Method: 生成多个长文本响应，将其嵌入到单位球面上，通过计算嵌入向量的角度离散度来估计语义各向同性水平。

Result: 发现更高的语义各向同性（即更大的嵌入离散度）可靠地表明样本间的事实一致性较低，该方法在多个领域都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、低成本的信任评估方法，可集成到实际LLM工作流程中，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NetMind是一个使用自然语言查询网络的框架，通过树状配置分块、统一事实图和混合命令-声明语言来解决LLM在网络配置分析中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模网络配置复杂，传统基于领域特定语言的方法学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限，而自然语言提供了更易访问和可解释的接口。

Method: 采用树状配置分块策略保持语义连贯性，构建统一事实图作为中间表示来规范化厂商特定配置，设计混合命令-声明语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind实现了准确且可扩展的网络行为理解，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind通过创新的配置处理和推理方法，有效解决了LLM在网络配置分析中的关键挑战，为自然语言驱动的网络行为理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

*Hongbo Zhang,Han Cui,Yidong Wang,Yijian Tian,Qi Guo,Cunxiang Wang,Jian Wu,Chiyu Song,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出IterSurvey框架，通过循环大纲生成和论文卡片机制，实现自动文献综述的迭代式生成，显著提升了内容覆盖度、结构连贯性和引用质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动文献综述系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化、上下文过载等问题，限制了综述质量。受人类研究者迭代阅读过程的启发，需要更智能的生成方法。

Method: 基于循环大纲生成框架，规划代理逐步检索、阅读和更新大纲；设计论文卡片提炼每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现；引入审查-精炼循环和可视化增强来改善文本流畅度并整合多模态元素。

Result: 在既定和新兴主题上的实验表明，IterSurvey在内容覆盖度、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于最先进的基线方法，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述。

Conclusion: IterSurvey通过迭代式方法有效解决了传统自动文献综述系统的局限性，并引入Survey-Arena基准来更可靠地评估机器生成综述相对于人工撰写综述的质量。

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at
https://github.com/HancCui/IterSurvey\_Autosurveyv2.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

### [10] [Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21954)
*Mykola Haltiuk,Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATT提出了一种模型感知的分词器迁移方法，通过注意力影响建模目标将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，相比仅关注嵌入相似性的启发式方法，该方法能更有效地恢复模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型虽然支持多种语言，但预定义的分词器成为适应低资源或不同文字语言的瓶颈。现有的分词器迁移方法通常依赖语义启发式来初始化新嵌入，忽略了更高层的模型动态，限制了迁移质量。

Method: MATT方法引入注意力影响建模(AIM)目标，将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，在标准语言建模之前提供有效的预热。该方法利用注意力行为来指导嵌入初始化和适应。

Result: 在多种语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内就能恢复原始模型性能的很大一部分，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，融入模型级信号为多语言大语言模型中的鲁棒分词器迁移提供了一条实用且有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can distinguish authors by training individual models on each author's works, demonstrating unique writing styles and successfully attributing disputed authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can capture and identify unique writing styles of different authors, and apply this capability to resolve authorship attribution problems.

Method: Train individual GPT-2 models from scratch on each author's works, then compare prediction accuracy on held-out text from the same author versus other authors.

Result: Models trained on one author predict that author's text more accurately than others' text, confirming unique style embodiment. Successfully attributed R.P. Thompson as author of disputed Oz series book.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively capture and distinguish author-specific writing styles, providing a reliable method for authorship attribution.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Motivation: 现有研究很少关注影响LLMs对越狱攻击易感性的语言和心理机制，作者希望通过跨学科视角，利用社会科学中的说服理论来探索LLMs的安全漏洞。

Method: 基于社会科学的成熟说服策略，设计具有说服结构的对抗性提示，并在多个对齐LLMs上进行实证评估，分析LLMs在越狱响应中表现出的说服特征。

Result: 实证评估显示，基于说服理论的提示能显著绕过LLMs的安全保护机制，诱导越狱行为，表明说服策略在攻击LLMs对齐约束方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了跨学科洞察在应对LLM安全挑战中的重要性，说服理论为理解和防御LLMs越狱攻击提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

TL;DR: 本文分析了离散优化越狱攻击在大型语言模型中的可转移性，识别了三个与转移成功强相关的统计特性，并发现语义相似性与转移成功相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管离散优化越狱攻击产生的无意义后缀具有可转移性这一现象已被广泛观察，但缺乏对其发生时机和原因的严格分析。

Method: 通过大量实验设置，识别与转移成功强相关的三个统计特性：无后缀提示激活模型内部拒绝方向的程度、后缀诱导远离拒绝方向的强度，以及这些偏移在正交于拒绝方向上的大小。

Result: 发现三个统计特性与转移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关。这些发现可用于实际改进攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对可转移性的更精细理解，并通过干预实验展示了统计分析如何转化为攻击成功的实际改进。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

TL;DR: 研究发现质量评估(QE)指标存在长度偏见，会过度预测长翻译的错误并偏好短翻译，提出了长度归一化和引入参考文本两种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译中至关重要，但长度偏见的影响尚未充分研究，可能对长翻译造成不公平惩罚并导致次优决策。

Method: 系统研究了10种语言对中表现最好的回归基和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标，发现两种长度偏见模式，并提出长度归一化训练和参考文本评估两种缓解方法。

Result: QE指标确实存在系统性长度偏见：随着翻译长度增加会过度预测错误，且在多个候选翻译中偏好较短版本。提出的两种方法都能有效减少这种偏见。

Conclusion: QE指标存在严重的长度偏见问题，需要通过长度归一化和参考文本等策略来缓解，以确保公平评估和优化应用决策。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缩放定律研究主要集中在英语上，但最先进的AI模型需要服务数十亿国际用户。需要研究多语言环境下的缩放定律，为超越英语优先的AI提供科学基础。

Method: 进行了774个多语言训练实验，涵盖不同参数规模的模型和多种语言。引入了自适应迁移缩放定律(ATLAS)，推导了跨语言迁移矩阵，测量了1444个语言对的相互受益分数。

Result: ATLAS在样本外泛化方面比现有缩放定律表现更好，R²通常提高0.3以上。推导了语言无关的缩放定律，揭示了在添加语言时如何最优地扩展模型大小和数据。确定了从头预训练与从多语言检查点微调的计算交叉点。

Conclusion: 这些发现为跨语言民主化缩放定律提供了科学基础，使从业者能够高效地扩展模型，超越英语优先的AI。研究揭示了多语言学习动态、语言间迁移特性以及多语言性的诅咒。

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

### [16] [Emotions Where Art Thou: Understanding and Characterizing the Emotional Latent Space of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22042)
*Benjamin Reichman,Adar Avsian,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，揭示了LLM内部情感表示的低维流形结构，发现情感表示具有方向性编码、跨层分布的特点，并在多语言数据集上验证了通用情感子空间的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何内部表示情感，理解其情感处理机制，为模型情感理解和控制提供理论基础。

Method: 分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，识别低维情感流形，通过跨域对齐和线性探测验证情感表示的通用性，并开发干预模块来操控内部情感感知。

Result: 发现LLM中存在稳定的低维情感流形，情感表示具有方向性编码和跨层分布特性，在五个语言的八个数据集上表现出强通用性，通过干预模块能有效操控情感感知而不影响语义。

Conclusion: LLM中存在一致且可操控的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解，也为情感导向的模型控制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

*Atij Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了六种减轻语言模型性别偏见的方法，发现监督微调(SFT)在约束遵循和词汇多样性方面表现最佳，而基于偏好的方法(如DPO)无法满足组合约束要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型即使在职业中性语境下仍会产生性别刻板印象语言，反映了深层社会偏见。现有偏见缓解方法的比较效果和学习动态尚不清楚。

Method: 比较分析六种偏见缓解控制技术：仅提示、生成后过滤、DFA-based Ctrl-G解码、监督微调(SFT)、直接偏好优化(DPO)和迭代零空间投影(INLP)。在组合约束任务上评估，要求生成包含至少一个主动性和一个社群性描述符的句子。

Result: SFT达到99.87%的约束遵循率和高的词汇多样性；DPO仅4.53%遵循率；Ctrl-G保证完美遵循但严重降低流畅性和多样性。偏好学习无法满足组合约束，因为二元偏好信号编码的是排序而非逻辑连接。

Conclusion: 只有明确的正面监督能够缓解组合偏见；基于偏好的对齐无法泛化逻辑结构，凸显了偏好学习的局限性以及明确监督对于公平流畅控制生成的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

### [18] [Generalization or Memorization: Dynamic Decoding for Mode Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22099)
*Xuanming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来理解和控制LLMs的泛化与记忆两种推理模式，包括基于信息瓶颈的理论模型和动态模式引导(DMS)推理算法，能显著提升逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在泛化能力和逐字记忆训练数据的双重性，这种不可预测性影响了其在关键应用中的可靠性，需要系统性的方法来识别和控制这两种推理模式。

Method: 1) 基于信息瓶颈原理的理论模型，将泛化定义为学习压缩的任务相关表示，记忆视为压缩失败；2) 动态模式引导(DMS)算法，包含轻量级因果线性探针和动态激活引导机制，将模型计算推向预识别的泛化电路。

Result: 在推理和忠实性任务上的实验表明，DMS显著提高了逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Conclusion: DMS为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，通过自适应自对比解码来引导模型偏向泛化推理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过输入级对数压缩而非修改Transformer架构来处理长上下文的方法，在WikiText-103和PG-19基准测试中降低了困惑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文处理方法通常通过集成循环或辅助内存模块来增加Transformer内部架构的复杂性，本文寻求一种替代方法。

Method: 受人类记忆认知模型启发，对输入标记应用尺度不变的对数压缩，生成压缩表示后由标准未修改的Transformer处理。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线降低了困惑度，且随着压缩时间上下文的延长性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级对数压缩是扩展Transformer长程记忆的简单有效方法，保持了架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

Motivation: 构建能够高效扩展推理能力的语言基础模型，通过稀疏激活与推理目标的对齐来实现可扩展且高效的人工智能。

Method: 采用高稀疏性MoE架构与MTP技术、推理导向的数据和训练中思维链激活、基于强化的微调方法，以及全尺度FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: Ling-1T在万亿参数规模上建立了推理准确性与计算效率的新帕累托前沿，相比稠密模型实现了高达7倍的活跃计算效率。

Conclusion: Ling 2.0为推进未来推理和思维模型提供了一个连贯、开放且高效的基础框架，证明了稀疏激活在推理目标对齐下的可扩展性和效率优势。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG智能客服系统存在幻觉问题和机械式响应，可能带来业务风险并影响用户体验

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Learn-to-Think阶段学习专家推理过程，Learn-to-Respond阶段结合监督微调和强化学习进行自我优化

Result: 在工业级社交客服环境中，社区支持场景智能解决率提升28.92%，直播互动场景提升18.42%，人工接管率分别降低6.08%和7.12%

Conclusion: OlaMind框架在多样化实际应用中表现一致有效，显著提升了智能客服的人类相似度和安全性

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源语言迈蒂利语创建了首个可解释情感分析数据集，包含3,221个标注了情感极性和自然语言解释的句子，填补了该语言在NLP研究中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决迈蒂利语等低资源语言在自然语言处理中资源稀缺的问题，特别是缺乏细粒度标注和可解释性机制，推动多语言NLP和可解释AI的发展。

Method: 引入包含3,221个迈蒂利语句子的新数据集，每个句子都标注了情感极性和自然语言解释，并由语言专家精心策划和验证以确保标签可靠性和上下文保真度。

Result: 使用经典机器学习和最先进的transformer架构进行的广泛实验证明了该数据集在可解释情感分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算的基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的广泛进步贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DETECT，首个德语专用的文本简化评估指标，通过LLM生成合成质量分数，在简化度、意义保留和流畅性三个维度上全面评估德语ATS质量，相比现有指标与人类评价相关性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语自动文本简化评估依赖通用指标如SARI、BLEU和BERTScore，这些指标无法充分捕捉简化质量在简化度、意义保留和流畅性方面的表现。虽然英语已有LENS等专用指标，但德语由于缺乏人工标注语料库而落后。

Method: 将LENS框架适配到德语，并扩展了：(i) 通过LLM生成合成质量分数的流程，无需人工标注即可创建数据集；(ii) 基于LLM的精炼步骤，使评分标准与简化需求对齐。还构建了最大的德语人工评估数据集进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，DETECT相比广泛使用的ATS指标与人类判断的相关性显著更高，在意义保留和流畅性方面提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语ATS评估的空白，同时揭示了LLM在自动评估中的潜力和局限性，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可转移的指导原则。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量LLM在文本对比较任务中的输出错误概率，特别是偏好判断的错误率，而不依赖真实标签。

Method: 使用两种比较场景：(i)均匀错误率，通过每个文本对的两次比较估计；(ii)二元位置偏差，假设两种比较顺序有不同错误率，通过重复比较估计。采用Copeland计数从成对偏好构建文本排名。

Result: 在6个LLM和5种文本输入类型上获得一致的错误率估计。两个位置偏差项相似，接近均匀错误。Claude在错误率和提示鲁棒性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在指示LLM文本比较任务错误方面优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性评分，Claude在此实验中表现最理想。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的局限性，指出即使所有基本假设都满足，数学上对语言分离时间的估计精度也存在固有极限。同时提出了词汇渐进修改过程对语言演变的重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法在语言分离时间估计中存在多种不现实的假设和污染现象，导致结果不准确。更重要的是，即使假设完全满足，数学上对估计精度也存在固有极限，这些概率性限制在词汇统计学研究中常被忽视。

Method: 从纯概率角度分析Swadesh方法的数学局限性，并引入词汇渐进修改这一随机过程作为语言词汇演变的重要驱动力。

Result: 揭示了Swadesh方法在语言分离时间估计中的固有精度限制，证明了词汇渐进修改过程对词汇重塑的重要贡献，并显示考虑这一过程能显著提高时间分离估计的精度。

Conclusion: 语言年代学研究需要考虑词汇渐进修改过程，这能显著提高语言分离时间估计的精度，同时必须认识到Swadesh方法存在的数学固有局限性。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进标准CoT提示，减少语义模糊性和常识错误导致的推理错误。

Method: 提出"Sculpting"约束提示方法，在GSM8K数学推理基准上评估三种提示策略（Zero Shot、标准CoT、Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型（gpt-4o-mini、gpt-4o、gpt-5）上的表现。

Result: Sculpting在gpt-4o上表现优于标准CoT（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而更差（94.00% vs 96.36%），出现"提示反转"现象。

Conclusion: 最优提示策略必须与模型能力共同进化，对更先进的模型应使用更简单的提示，避免约束条件从"护栏"变成"手铐"。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

### [28] [PatenTEB: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Model Family for Patent Text Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22264)
*Iliass Ayaou,Denis Cavallucci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PatenTEB专利文本嵌入基准，包含15个任务和206万样本，并开发了patembed模型家族，在专利检索和聚类任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分捕捉专利特定挑战，需要专门的专利文本嵌入基准来支持先有技术搜索、技术布局和专利分析。

Method: 采用领域分层分割、领域特定硬负样本挖掘，覆盖非对称片段到文档匹配场景，通过多任务训练开发patembed模型家族（67M-344M参数，最长4096 token上下文）。

Result: patembed-base在MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2上达到0.494 V-measure（之前最佳0.445），patembed-large在DAPFAM上达到0.377 NDCG@100，显示出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多任务训练提升外部泛化能力，领域预训练初始化在不同任务家族中提供一致优势，所有资源将开源。

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All
resources will be made available at https://github.com/iliass-y/patenteb.

*Tu Anh Dinh,Philipp Nicolas Schumacher,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了两种将大学课程材料整合到LLMs中的策略：检索增强生成(RAG)和持续预训练(CPT)，发现对于小规模课程材料，RAG更有效且高效，特别是多模态RAG方法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在教育场景中支持学生学习，但在大学计算机科学课程中准确回答问题仍存在困难，需要探索如何利用课程材料来提升LLM性能。

Method: 比较RAG和CPT两种策略，对于包含视觉元素的幻灯片材料，进一步探索多模态RAG方法，将检索内容以图像形式呈现给生成器。

Result: 实验表明，对于相对小规模的大学课程材料，RAG比CPT更有效和高效；多模态设置中，将幻灯片作为图像整合能显著优于仅文本检索的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更好地支持学习和教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，并希望激励其他教育背景下的类似努力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

*Andrei Baroian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了三种临床命名实体识别方法：BERT类编码器、GPT-4o的少样本上下文学习以及GPT-4o的监督微调，发现监督微调效果最佳但成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同方法在临床命名实体识别任务上的表现，特别是比较传统BERT模型与大型语言模型在不同设置下的效果。

Method: 使用CADEC语料库，比较三类方法：(1) BERT类编码器(BERT Base、BioClinicalBERT、RoBERTa-large)；(2) GPT-4o少样本上下文学习(简单vs复杂提示)；(3) GPT-4o监督微调。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base提升有限；简单提示优于复杂提示；监督微调达到最佳性能(F1≈87.1%)但成本较高；LLM在二分类简化任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: GPT-4o监督微调在临床NER任务上表现最佳，但需权衡性能与成本；简单提示策略更有效；LLM在简化任务上优势更明显。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求比深度神经网络语言建模更高效、更环保的替代方案，减少训练和推理过程中的生态足迹。

Method: 采用基于记忆的语言建模方法，实现k近邻分类的快速近似，完全依赖CPU运行，实现低延迟。

Result: 开发的OLIFANT模型在下一词预测准确率、排放估计和速度方面与GPT-2和GPT-Neo进行了比较，显示出竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于记忆的语言建模是一种简单透明、生态友好的语言建模方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个多语言目标立场提取(TSE)基准，涵盖加泰罗尼亚语、爱沙尼亚语、法语、意大利语、普通话和西班牙语，展示了将TSE扩展到多语言环境的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体为分析争议性议题的公众意见提供了数据驱动的方法。虽然已有许多研究在给定目标的情况下进行多语言立场分类，但所有先前的TSE研究仅限于英语。

Method: 将原始的TSE流程扩展到多语言环境，无需为每种语言单独训练模型，构建了涵盖六种语言的多语言TSE基准。

Result: 模型管道获得了12.78的F1分数，表明多语言任务相对于仅英语设置的难度增加，目标预测是主要瓶颈。同时首次证明了TSE的F1分数对不同目标表达方式的敏感性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE的资源、算法和评估标准提供了急需的基准，为未来多语言立场分析研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代精炼循环来解决复杂多跳查询中的证据缺口问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源合成信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统识别和填补证据缺口的机制，容易传播噪声或无法收集完整上下文。

Method: 引入FAIR-RAG框架，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块，将查询分解为所需发现清单，审计聚合证据以识别确认事实和明确信息缺口，通过自适应查询精炼代理生成针对性子查询来检索缺失信息。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等挑战性多跳QA基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线。在HotpotQA上F1得分为0.453，比最强迭代基线绝对提升8.3分，在这些基准上建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 具有显式缺口分析的结构化、证据驱动的精炼过程对于在复杂知识密集型任务中实现可靠准确的推理至关重要。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

TL;DR: 提出了VisJudge-Bench，首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在可视化美学和质量评估方面能力的综合基准，包含3,090个专家标注样本。研究发现现有MLLMs与人类专家存在显著差距，并提出了专门的可视化评估模型VisJudge，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时判断数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像美学评估中表现良好，但缺乏系统性的可视化评估基准。

Method: 构建VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3,090个专家标注的真实场景样本，涵盖32种图表类型。提出专门的可视化评估模型VisJudge来解决现有MLLMs的不足。

Result: 测试发现最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家存在显著差距（MAE=0.551，相关性=0.429）。VisJudge模型显著缩小了这一差距，将MAE降至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（提高58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench填补了可视化质量评估基准的空白，VisJudge模型在可视化美学和质量评估方面显著优于通用MLLMs，为可视化评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Conclusion: CAP数据集公开发布，旨在促进幻觉检测、LLMs多语言评估以及更可靠的科学NLP系统的开发方面的先进研究。

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: CHOIR是一个测试时框架，通过协调多个角色条件下的推理信号来提高LLM推理的鲁棒性，无需额外训练即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色分配的LLMs在人口统计信息微扰（如代词变化）时会产生不同的推理轨迹和正确答案。作者不将这些变化视为需要消除的偏见，而是探索其作为提高推理鲁棒性的建设性资源。

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在反事实角色之间进行协作解码，动态平衡推理路径中的一致性和分歧，将多个角色条件下的推理信号协调为统一预测。

Result: 在各种推理基准测试中，CHOIR持续提升了跨人口统计、模型架构、规模和任务的性能，个体人口统计组改进高达26.4%，五个人口统计组平均改进19.2%，即使在基础角色不理想时仍有效。

Conclusion: 通过将角色变化重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR为更可靠的LLM推理提供了可扩展和可泛化的方法。

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统声调发生研究主要依赖比较重建和声学分析，需要开发计算方法来量化音高在不同声调发展阶段的功能负荷。

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音平坦化的敏感度。

Result: 发现声调发生连续谱：无调安多方言对音高移除容忍度最高，完全有调卫藏方言性能严重下降，中间康方言处于两者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法能捕捉声音变化的精细阶段，传统基于最小对立对的功能负荷指标可能高估过渡系统中对音高的依赖程度。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

### [41] [The Limits of Data Scaling: Sub-token Utilization and Acoustic Saturation in Multilingual ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22492)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Whisper多语言ASR模型在49种语言上的解码行为，发现子词标记的发现数量与预训练数据量无关，子词发现率遵循指数饱和模式，提出了声学饱和时间(AST)概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多语言ASR模型学习到的子词标记库在不同语言中的观察需求，以及预训练数据差异是否影响推理时这些标记的利用方式。

Method: 通过记录49种语言的解码候选子词标记，跟踪其随时间累积的发现情况，分析模型子词空间的利用模式。

Result: 子词发现总数与语言预训练小时数无关；发现率呈现一致的指数饱和模式；拉丁文字语言比西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字语言表现更好；子词长度与资源水平正相关。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语音的统计、类型学和正字法结构约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供了实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

### [42] [A Sociophonetic Analysis of Racial Bias in Commercial ASR Systems Using the Pacific Northwest English Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22495)
*Michael Scott,Siyu Liang,Alicia Wassink,Gina-Anne Levow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对四个主要商业ASR系统在太平洋西北英语语料库中的种族偏见进行系统性评估，发现语音质量变异是ASR系统偏见的主要来源，特别是非洲裔美国说话者受影响最严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估商业ASR系统中存在的种族偏见，分析社会语音变异如何导致不同种族群体的识别性能差异。

Method: 使用太平洋西北英语语料库，分析四个种族背景说话者的转录准确率，引入启发式确定的语音错误率指标，评估11个社会语音特征。

Result: 发现元音质量变异，特别是对低后元音合并和前鼻音合并模式的抵抗，与不同种族群体的错误率差异系统性相关，非洲裔美国说话者在所有评估系统中受影响最显著。

Conclusion: 方言语音变异的声学建模，而非词汇或句法因素，是商业ASR系统偏见的主要来源。PNWE语料库可作为语音技术偏见评估的宝贵资源，通过针对性表示训练数据中的社会语音多样性来改进ASR性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

*Noshitha Padma Pratyusha Juttu,Sahithi Singireddy,Sravani Gona,Sujal Timilsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了针对服务条款中不公平条款检测的不同LLM适应策略，发现完全微调在精确率-召回率平衡方面表现最佳，而基于LoRA的方法能以3倍低内存成本提供有竞争力的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本理解方面取得了突破，但在专业法律领域的适应仍受限于完全微调的高成本，需要探索更高效的适应方法。

Method: 使用BERT和DistilBERT进行完全微调，对TinyLlama、LLaMA 3B/7B和SaulLM等模型应用4位低秩适应(LoRA)，并在零样本设置下评估GPT-4o及其变体。

Result: 在CLAUDETTE-ToS基准和多语言爬取语料库上的实验表明，完全微调实现了最强的精确率-召回率平衡，而基于LoRA的模型以最多3倍低内存成本提供了有竞争力的召回率。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了高效和领域适应LLM的实际设计权衡，为法律文本处理中的微调研究提供了开放的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

### [44] [LooGLE v2: Are LLMs Ready for Real World Long Dependency Challenges?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22548)
*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在真实世界长文本应用中理解能力的新基准，包含16k到2M token的文本，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码等领域。评估发现即使最佳模型也只达到59.2%的总体得分，表明LLMs的实际长上下文理解能力远低于其宣称的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩展，但它们在长依赖任务中的实际理解能力仍然有限且未被充分探索，特别是在许多真实世界长上下文应用中缺乏基准测试。

Method: 构建LooGLE v2基准，包含自动收集的真实世界长文本（16k-2M token），涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码领域，设计了10种领域特定的长依赖任务类型，生成1,934个多样化和复杂的问答实例。

Result: 对6个本地部署和4个API基础的LLMs进行全面评估，结果显示即使最佳模型在基准上的总体得分仅为59.2%，表明流行的LLMs只能理解比其宣称长度短得多的上下文。

Conclusion: 尽管上下文窗口广泛，但大语言模型在处理具有长依赖关系的真实世界任务方面存在显著局限性，在实际长上下文理解方面还有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存不断增长的内存占用成为长上下文LLM推理的可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: 首先进行语义分割使压缩边界与语言结构对齐，然后应用分段引导的token评分来优化token重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在Needle-in-a-Haystack测试中，仅用96个KV条目就达到99.9%的检索准确率，接近保留8K条目的全缓存基线性能。在固定缓存预算1024下，峰值内存使用减少46.28%，在128K上下文长度下解码速度提升高达9.5倍。

Conclusion: SABlock在相同内存预算下持续优于现有最优方法，有效解决了长上下文LLM推理中的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

*Zhifeng Wang,Xinyue Zheng,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的个性化学习代理EduLoop-Agent，通过整合神经认知诊断模型、自适应测试策略和大语言模型，形成诊断-推荐-反馈的闭环框架，实现个性化学习路径生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理建模、题目选择和反馈，导致学生模型粗糙、自适应忽略诊断后验、反馈缺乏针对性。需要构建闭环的个性化学习系统。

Method: 集成三个模块：神经认知诊断模型(NCD)提供细粒度知识掌握度评估；有界能力估计自适应测试(BECAT)动态选择题目；大语言模型(LLM)生成结构化反馈。

Result: 在ASSISTments数据集上，NCD模块在响应预测和可解释掌握度评估方面表现良好；自适应推荐策略提高了题目相关性和个性化；LLM反馈提供了针对性学习指导。

Conclusion: 该设计有效且可实际部署，为智能教育中生成个性化学习轨迹提供了可行路径。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的成功加速了基于大语言模型的智能导学系统发展，但这些系统的进展和影响因缺乏可靠、通用且基于教学法的评估框架而难以追踪。现有评估方法依赖主观协议和非标准化基准，导致不一致性和有限泛化性。

Method: 通过回顾最先进的评估实践，结合真实案例研究，分析相关挑战。基于先前跨学科AI教育研究的见解，提出三个实用、可行且理论支撑的研究方向。

Result: 识别了当前智能导学系统评估中的主要问题：缺乏标准化基准、主观评估协议和有限泛化性。通过案例研究展示了这些挑战的实际表现。

Conclusion: 需要建立基于学习科学原则的公平、统一且可扩展的评估方法，以推动智能导学系统的可靠发展和有效评估。提出了三个具体研究方向来实现这一目标。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

TL;DR: AutoBench是一个全自动、自维持的LLM评估框架，通过相互同行评审来动态生成新颖评估任务，解决传统静态基准的测试集污染和适应性有限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准存在测试集污染和适应性有限的问题，需要一种能够持续评估不断发展的语言模型的动态评估方法。

Method: 采用相互同行评估方法，模型交替担任问题生成者、参赛者和评委角色，通过迭代加权机制放大可靠评估者的影响力，聚合同行判断形成基于共识的排名。

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准有强相关性（分别为78%和63%），多评委设计显著优于单评委基线，证明分布式评估能产生更稳健和人类一致的评估结果。

Conclusion: AutoBench为不断发展的语言模型提供了可扩展、抗污染的连续评估替代方案，优于静态基准。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Conclusion: PCU不仅能够改善个人健康结果，还为公共卫生和科学发现提供了新的基础，但其架构、设计原则和实现挑战仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

Conclusion: PerCoR是有效的波斯语常识推理基准，DRESS-AF方法可提升数据集难度而不影响人类可解性，且可迁移到英语基准上。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂关系模式并缓解数据稀疏性，特别是在处理长尾分布问题时表现不佳

Method: 使用邻域聚合编码器整合高阶邻居信息，共轭关系学习器结合隐式条件扩散关系模块和稳定关系模块，以及流形共轭解码器在流形空间中进行高效评估和推理

Result: 在三个基准测试中，该方法优于现有最先进方法，取得了优越性能

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架通过共轭关系建模有效解决了FKGC中的挑战，为少样本知识图谱补全提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的if-then规则主要用于解释传统机器学习模型，但缺乏针对RAG增强的LLM系统的解释方法，需要开发能够解释检索来源如何影响模型输出的规则。

Method: 采用类似Apriori算法的剪枝优化策略，通过分析不同检索来源组合对LLM输出的影响来生成解释规则，避免暴力枚举所有可能的来源组合。

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)

incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SALSA是一个结合结构化提示、类别到令牌映射和参数高效微调的文本分类方法，避免了冷启动训练，在单次前向传播中实现高效准确的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大语言模型具有出色的泛化能力，但在文本分类基准测试中往往表现不佳，需要改进其分类性能。

Method: 将每个类别标签映射到不同的输出令牌，构建提示以引出单令牌响应，在推理时仅将模型输出投影到相关类别令牌的logits上。

Result: SALSA在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了其在基于LLM的分类应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SALSA通过结构化提示和类别令牌映射的方法，有效提升了LLM在文本分类任务上的性能，为LLM分类应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E²Rank是一个统一的嵌入排序框架，通过继续训练将单个文本嵌入模型扩展到同时执行高质量检索和列表重排序，在保持效率的同时显著提升重排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本嵌入模型在检索应用中效率高但排序保真度有限，而专用的重排序器（特别是基于LLM的列表重排序器）能捕获细粒度的查询-文档和文档-文档交互，但效率较低。需要统一框架来兼顾效率和效果。

Method: 使用查询和文档嵌入之间的余弦相似度作为统一排序函数，构建包含原始查询和候选文档的列表排序提示，类似于传统检索模型中的伪相关反馈(PRF)。通过列表排序目标下的继续训练，扩展单个嵌入模型执行检索和重排序。

Result: 在BEIR重排序基准上达到最先进结果，在推理密集型BRIGHT基准上表现竞争性，重排序延迟极低。排序训练过程还提高了MTEB基准上的嵌入性能。

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型可以有效统一检索和重排序，提供计算效率和竞争性排序准确性的双重优势。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

TL;DR: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练，在有限数据和计算预算下将大型语言模型适配到魁北克法语方言，显著提升方言基准性能，同时保持主语言性能的最小回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的能力主要局限于高资源语言，而低资源方言缺乏训练数据。研究如何在有限数据和计算预算下通过持续预训练缩小方言差距，为少数语言社区提供高质量LLM访问。

Method: 采用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练方法，使用非常小的数据集将三个LLM适配到魁北克法语方言，并在COLE套件上进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示在方言基准上有所改进，主语言基准回归最小，仅更新不到1%的模型参数。结果分析表明收益高度依赖于语料库组成。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调的持续预训练可以通过成本效益高且可持续的语言资源创建来缩小方言差距，扩大少数语言社区对高质量LLM的访问。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差，发现模型在预测下一个词时对序列开头和结尾的重复词有偏好，这与人类情景记忆的分离机制类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何像人类情景记忆一样，根据时间关系来区分和检索上下文信息，理解模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差机制。

Method: 通过固定重复词位置并置换其他词来消除语义干扰，专门研究时间因素对下一个词预测的影响。使用包含多个相同词重复出现的序列，分析transformer和状态空间模型的表现。

Result: 模型在预测时对重复词后的词赋予最高概率，但偏向序列开头或结尾的重复词。中间位置的记忆检索可靠性较低。transformer和状态空间模型都表现出相似的时间偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了上下文学习中存在的时间偏差，这种偏差能够实现时间分离和情景检索，深化了对模型记忆机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

TL;DR: EchoMind是首个多层级、相互关联的基准测试，通过顺序任务模拟共情对话的认知过程，评估语音语言模型在整合语言内容和声音线索方面的共情能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能整合对于类人、情感智能对话的重要性。需要评估SLM是否能同时感知非词汇声音线索和口语词汇，并做出符合情感和上下文因素的共情回应。

Method: 设计了EchoMind基准测试，包含口语内容理解、声音线索感知、整合推理和回应生成四个顺序任务。所有任务共享相同的语义中性脚本，通过控制声音风格变化来测试独立于文本的传递效果。基于包含3个粗粒度和12个细粒度维度的共情导向框架，涵盖39个声音属性，使用主客观指标进行评估。

Result: 测试12个先进SLM发现，即使最先进的模型在处理高表达性声音线索方面也存在困难，限制了共情回应质量。在指令遵循、对自然语音变化的适应能力以及有效利用声音线索实现共情方面存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: 结果表明，需要开发能够整合语言内容和多样化声音线索的SLM，才能实现真正的共情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

TL;DR: MMPersuade是一个研究大型视觉语言模型多模态说服动态的统一框架，包括多模态数据集和评估方法，发现多模态输入显著增强说服效果，不同策略在不同场景下效果各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们面临大量说服性内容。了解模型如何被多模态说服输入影响至关重要，因为过度易被说服的模型可能采纳误导性信念、覆盖用户偏好或生成不道德输出。

Method: 提出了MMPersuade框架，包含：(i) 包含图像和视频的多模态数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为和对立场景的说服原则；(ii) 通过第三方协议评分和自估计token概率评估说服效果和模型易感性。

Result: 对六个领先LVLMs的研究发现：(i) 多模态输入相比纯文本显著提高说服效果和模型易感性，特别是在错误信息场景；(ii) 声明的先前偏好降低易感性，但多模态信息保持说服优势；(iii) 不同策略在不同场景效果不同，互惠在商业和主观场景最有效，可信度和逻辑在对立场景占主导。

Conclusion: 通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，MMPersuade为开发在面对说服性多模态内容时具有鲁棒性、偏好一致性和伦理对齐的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

TL;DR: R4P是一个基于推理的补丁验证模型，为软件工程代理提供可扩展的奖励机制，解决了传统基于测试的监督方法在可扩展性和稳定性方面的限制。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在两个主要问题：(1) 构建和运行测试沙箱既繁重又脆弱；(2) 具有高覆盖率测试的数据稀缺且容易受到边缘案例测试攻击的威胁。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，采用分组目标进行强化学习训练，能够验证多个补丁之间的修改关系，提供密集奖励以实现稳定训练。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上的补丁验证准确率达到72.2%，超越OpenAI o3。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2% Pass@1，比原始Qwen3-32B提升10.0%。R4P验证补丁速度比平均测试快50倍。

Conclusion: R4P通过推理驱动的补丁验证提供了可扩展、高效的奖励机制，显著提升了软件工程代理的性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Motivation: 人道组织面临选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费开源模型进行多语言人权监测。商业系统可靠但成本高，开源替代方案缺乏实证验证，特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言上。

Method: 在7种语言上对6个模型进行78,000次多语言推理评估，包括4个对齐模型和2个开源模型，使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性指标：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性评分和语言稳定性评分。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关的推理能力，为人道组织在多语言部署中平衡预算约束与可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法如CoT和PoT在复杂多步推理中仍会产生不理想的解决方案，特别是在算法领域，需要更有效的推理增强方法。

Method: 提出PIPS方法：1）在实例级别生成和优化程序；2）使用结构反馈而不依赖任务特定指导；3）引入置信度指标动态选择直接推理或程序合成。

Result: 在3个前沿LLM和30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别提升绝对调和平均准确率8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中减少不良程序生成65.1%。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和动态策略选择，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的性能，减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with

*Linyang He,Tianjun Zhong,Richard Antonello,Gavin Mischler,Micah Goldblum,Nima Mesgarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差解缠方法，从语言模型中分离出词汇、句法、语义和推理四个正交嵌入，用于分析大脑对语言处理的神经机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型内部表示高度纠缠，难以分离不同认知过程的神经基础，特别是深层推理过程。

Method: 通过探测语言模型识别特征特定层，迭代回归掉低层表示，生成四个正交嵌入：词汇、句法、语义和推理。

Result: 推理嵌入具有独特预测能力，能解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差，且时间特征更晚（350-400ms），与处理层次一致。

Conclusion: 标准未解缠的语言模型嵌入可能误导，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征，掩盖了深层认知处理的贡献。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

*Tiasa Singha Roy,Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri,Ilias Triantafyllopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs存在不确定性现象，即模型会将先前正确的答案翻转为错误答案。通过识别并屏蔽一小部分非检索注意力头，可以显著减少翻转行为达15%，但下游任务存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在不确定性现象，这会破坏信任并在高风险领域带来严重风险，因此需要研究其驱动机制并找到缓解方法。

Method: 采用Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，集成Flip式重新评估提示来模拟真实答案翻转场景，识别并分析导致不确定性的注意力头。

Result: 发现检索头不是避免不确定性的主要原因，而是识别出一小部分非检索注意力头会过度关注误导性标记。屏蔽这些头可将翻转行为减少达15%，且不会引入不连贯或过度修正。

Conclusion: 研究为机制可解释性领域做出贡献，提出了一种简单有效的技术来缓解LLMs中不确定性驱动的失败模式，但在下游任务中存在权衡。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本越来越接近人类水平，需要大规模、多样化且标注良好的数据集来可靠检测AI生成文本并将其归因到特定模型。

Method: 创建了一个包含真实纽约时报文章和由Gemma-2-9b、Mistral-7B、Qwen-2-72B、LLaMA-8B、Yi-Large、GPT-4-o等先进LLM生成的合成文本的数据集，提供原始文章摘要作为提示和完整的人类撰写叙述。

Conclusion: 通过将真实世界新闻内容与现代生成模型相结合，该数据集旨在推动开发强大的检测和归因方法，在生成AI时代促进信任和透明度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust
detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era

### [71] [Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22876)
*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种批量推测解码方法EQSPEC和EXSPEC，解决了批量处理中的参差不齐张量问题，在保持输出等价性的同时实现了高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量推测解码对于生产环境至关重要，但会引入参差不齐张量问题：同一批次中的序列接受不同数量的推测标记，这会破坏右对齐并损坏位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态。现有实现违反了输出等价性要求。

Method: 提出了EQSPEC方法（暴露重新对齐开销占40%）和EXSPEC方法（维护滑动序列池并动态形成相同长度组），通过正确同步要求和动态分组来减少重新对齐开销。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B目标/草稿模型对，在批次大小8时相比批次大小1实现了高达3倍的吞吐量提升，同时保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需定制内核，可干净地集成到现有推理堆栈中，实现了高效的批量扩展，同时保证了推测解码的正确性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

*Yifan Zhang,Lanser Contributors*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI是一个CLI优先的编排层，通过固定和协调语言服务器协议(LSP)服务器，为编码代理和CI提供确定性、可重放的工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉API和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能计算关于真实代码的已验证、IDE级事实。

Method: 开发了选择器DSL进行稳健寻址、确定性分析包、安全变异操作信封，以及基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并确立了过程奖励的单调性属性，适用于过程监督和反事实分析。

Conclusion: 语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励，使代理的规划循环与程序现实保持一致。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题上的输出多样性，揭示了语言模型存在的人工蜂群效应（模式崩溃），即模型内部和不同模型之间产生高度相似的回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类人的创意内容方面存在困难，这可能导致人类思维长期同质化的风险。目前缺乏可扩展的方法来评估语言模型输出的多样性，特别是在开放性问题领域。

Method: 构建了包含26K个多样化、真实世界开放性问题查询的Infinity-Chat数据集，建立了第一个全面的开放性问题提示分类法（6个顶级类别，17个子类别），并进行了31,250个人工标注。

Result: 研究发现语言模型存在明显的人工蜂群效应：模型内部重复（单个模型生成相似回答）和模型间同质性（不同模型生成惊人相似的输出）。语言模型、奖励模型和语言模型评判在引发不同个体偏好的模型生成上对人类评分的校准较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放性问题提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了减轻人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型在处理长复杂上下文时存在有效问答和推理的局限性，现有方法如RAG对分块、嵌入和检索策略敏感且需要大量预处理。

Method: 提出轻量级数据增强策略TAG，通过在检索文档中添加标签或仅将标签定义加入QA提示中，不改变文档结构和完整性。

Result: 在NoLima和NovelQA基准测试中，32K token上下文性能提升达17%，多跳查询的复杂推理问答性能提升2.9%。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的增强方法，能显著提升LLM在长上下文场景下的性能，且不依赖复杂的预处理步骤。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学、法律和教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对其输出事实准确性的担忧，现有评估方法难以处理长文本的复杂推理链和累积信息。

Method: 整合大规模长文本数据集、多智能体验证机制和加权评估指标，构建中文长文本事实性数据集LongHalluQA，开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国内模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

Motivation: 教育中需要客观可扩展的教学质量测量方法，传统通用LLM难以可靠应用复杂的课堂观察工具。

Method: 使用五种不同句子嵌入构建定制LLM，采用数据高效训练机制防止过拟合，分析注释上下文窗口。

Result: 专业模型达到人类水平表现（与专家评分相关性>0.65），更先进的模型将更多分数变异归因于课程级特征而非孤立话语。

Conclusion: 建立了一种可行且强大的AI驱动教学测量新方法，为教师发展提供可扩展、可靠且有效的反馈路径。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

Motivation: 深入理解不同架构大语言模型在上下文学习任务中的内部机制差异，探索模型架构对知识检索和理解能力的影响。

Method: 使用行为探测和干预方法，评估transformer、状态空间和混合架构LLM在两类知识型上下文学习任务上的表现。

Result: 发现不同架构LLM在任务表现相似但内部机制不同，函数向量主要位于自注意力和Mamba层，对参数知识检索更重要，而对上下文知识理解影响较小。

Conclusion: 不同架构LLM在上下文学习中采用不同机制，结合行为和机制分析对理解LLM能力至关重要，为跨架构和任务类型的理解提供了更细致的视角。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: TIR-Judge是一个端到端的强化学习框架，用于训练集成代码执行器的LLM评估器，在多个基准测试中超越了基于推理的评估器，并在无蒸馏训练的情况下达到与蒸馏变体相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估器仅依赖内在文本推理，限制了验证复杂约束和精确计算的能力，而工具集成推理在其他任务中已证明有效。

Method: 基于三个原则构建：多样化训练、灵活评估格式（点对点、成对、列表）以及无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习，集成代码执行器进行精确评估。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge在点对点评估上超越强推理评估器6.4%，成对评估上超越7.7%，列表评估性能与Claude-Opus-4相当（仅8B参数）。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评估器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，无需蒸馏即可达到高性能，证明了TIR-Judge框架的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 提出Knocking-Heads Attention (KHA)机制，通过共享对角初始化投影矩阵实现注意力头之间的特征级交互，解决了传统多头注意力机制中头间缺乏强交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制及其变体（如GQA、GTA）只是简单拼接各头的输出，缺乏头间的强交互，且增加头数会削弱单个头的能力。

Method: 在缩放点积注意力之前应用共享对角初始化投影矩阵，使注意力头能够相互"敲击"，实现跨头特征级交互，同时保持头特异性。

Result: 在6.1B参数MoE模型上的实验表明，KHA带来更优越和稳定的训练动态，在下游任务中表现更好，且仅增加少量参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: KHA是一种有效增强多头注意力交互能力的方法，可无缝集成到各种注意力变体中，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有的mRAG方法在低资源语言环境下通常检索英文文档并翻译成查询语言，但翻译质量差会降低生成性能。现有方法要么假设翻译质量足够好，要么使用重写方法导致事实扭曲和幻觉。

Method: 提出QTT-RAG方法，显式评估翻译质量的三个维度：语义等价性、语法准确性和自然流畅性，并将这些评分作为元数据附加，不改变原始内容。

Result: 在两个开放域QA基准（XORQA、MKQA）上使用6个指令调优的LLM（2.4B到14B参数）评估，涵盖两种低资源语言（韩语、芬兰语）和一种高资源语言（中文）。QTT-RAG优于基线方法（CrossRAG和DKM-RAG），在保持事实完整性的同时，使生成模型能够基于翻译可靠性做出明智决策。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG方法允许在低资源设置中有效使用跨语言文档，提供跨多语言领域的实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant
benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence
of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational
competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for
large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and
innovation in the advancement of LLMs.

TL;DR: MAP4TS是一个多角度提示框架，将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计，通过专门的提示组件增强LLM在时间序列预测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了时间序列数据特有的统计属性和时间依赖性，需要将经典时间序列分析知识整合到LLM提示设计中。

Method: 提出四个专门提示组件：全局领域提示、局部领域提示、统计提示和时间提示，结合原始时间序列嵌入，通过跨模态对齐模块生成统一表示。

Result: 在八个不同数据集上的实验表明，MAP4TS持续优于最先进的LLM方法，提示感知设计显著提升性能稳定性，GPT-2骨干网络在结构化提示下优于LLaMA等更大模型。

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在医学多文档摘要任务中引入层次结构输入能否改善模型跨文档信息组织能力，发现层次化方法能提高人类偏好并保持信息的事实性、覆盖度和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学多文档摘要是复杂任务，需要有效管理跨文档关系。传统平面摘要方法可能无法充分组织跨文档信息，因此研究层次结构是否能改善信息组织和上下文理解。

Method: 研究两种层次组织方法，在三个大语言模型上进行测试，使用自动指标、基于模型的指标和领域专家评估（偏好、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖度、事实性和连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工编写的摘要。层次化方法通常能保持信息的事实性、覆盖度和连贯性，同时提高人类对摘要的偏好。GPT-4模拟判断与人类判断在更客观的评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以改善模型生成的医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖度，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理包括捷克语在内的多种语言的未见词汇

Method: 使用单模型在73种语言数据上联合训练，引入基于频率加权和词干分离的训练-开发-测试重采样方法

Result: 模型轻量、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线，在SIGMORPHON基准和73个UD树库上表现良好

Conclusion: 证明了多语言建模在词形变化任务中的有效性，具有实际部署优势，所有代码已开源

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

### [86] [Beyond Higher Rank: Token-wise Input-Output Projections for Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23123)
*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA)，通过动态调整LoRA权重以适应输入token，实现token级别的输入-输出投影，在多个模型和数据集上优于标准LoRA及其变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入token共享相同的权重和输入-输出投影，限制了其捕捉token特定信息的能力，因为token之间存在固有的语义差异。

Method: TopLoRA将LoRA权重表示为$B\Sigma_X A$，其中$A$和$B$是低秩矩阵，$\Sigma_X$是根据每个输入token $X$生成的对角矩阵，动态调整LoRA权重以学习token级别的输入-输出投影。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TopLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA在不增加LoRA权重秩的情况下，通过动态调整权重实现了更细粒度的适应，有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at
https://github.com/Leopold1423/toplora-neurips25.

TL;DR: 该论文探索将语料库频率信息融入形态屈折任务，通过频率加权的训练-开发-测试分割、引入词元准确率评估指标以及频率感知训练方法，在43种语言中的26种上优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态屈折方法缺乏对词频分布的考虑，而实际部署中用户输入会反映自然文本的真实频率分布，因此需要将频率信息融入系统开发。

Method: 1) 结合词元不相交和频率加权的训练-开发-测试分割；2) 在标准类型准确率基础上引入词元准确率评估；3) 提出频率感知训练方法，将词频纳入采样过程。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种上优于均匀采样，表明频率信息能有效提升形态屈折性能。

Conclusion: 将语料库频率信息融入形态屈折任务能更好地反映实际部署场景，频率感知训练是有效的改进方法。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法通常丢弃低质量数据，忽略了其中蕴含的宝贵信号，且依赖不完美的质量过滤器。

Method: 提出ENTP框架，包含符号模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经组件（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成增强的指令-响应对）。

Result: 仅使用低质量数据构建的ENTP增强数据集在五个指令遵循基准测试中超越了13种现有数据选择方法，甚至优于在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调结果。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端生成方法无法产生精心制作的剧本，因为单一模型需要同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循这两种不同能力

Method: 双阶段精炼框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转化为丰富的小说风格散文，第二阶段将叙事精炼为专业格式剧本；采用混合数据合成解决训练数据稀缺问题

Result: 专业编剧盲评显示，DSR对Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线达到75%胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制数据合成能有效专业化LLM在复杂创意领域的能力

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

TL;DR: MATCH是一个新的无参考代码评估指标，使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的嵌入表示，通过相似性评分来评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代码生成日益普及，但准确评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度仍具挑战性。传统方法如单元测试难以扩展，语法相似度指标无法捕捉代码功能，现有无参考评估方法较少。

Method: 采用对比学习技术，为代码和自然语言任务描述生成有意义的嵌入表示，通过计算相似性得分来评估生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中与功能正确性和人类偏好的相关性均优于现有指标。

Conclusion: MATCH提供了一种有效的无参考代码评估方法，能够更好地反映生成代码的功能实现质量。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社交智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境下的过程推理能力已超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展出类人能力，它们越来越多地被部署为自主代理与人类互动，但在真实复杂社交互动中的性能评估仍面临挑战，现有数据集多通过模拟代理间交互构建，无法捕捉真实人类对话的语言风格和关系动态。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，从社交网络应用收集2,221个真实多轮对话构建SI-Bench基准，并对其中312个对话在8个主要模型上进行手动标注。

Result: 实验表明，最先进模型在复杂社交情境下的过程推理能力已超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类；引入思维链推理可能会降低大语言模型在社交对话任务中的表现。

Conclusion: SI-Bench填补了现有评估方法的空白，为评估大语言模型的社交智能提供了真实可靠的基准，揭示了模型在社交推理和回复质量方面的不同表现水平。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物关系提取对识别药物相互作用和预测副作用至关重要，但目前缺乏专门的数据集，需要采用迁移学习。

Method: 首先使用训练好的关系抽取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用于医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证提取的关系。

Result: 定量结果显示LLM同意71%从PubMed摘要子集中提取的关系，定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域的模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提取药物关系并揭示医学关系提取领域的挑战，特别是在处理模糊性方面。

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种句子级过程奖励模型（PRM），用于检测大型视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告中的临床幻觉，该模型在无需访问内部激活的情况下实现了模型无关的安全层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法缺乏句子级粒度，且在不同LVLM生成器间泛化能力不足，而临床幻觉会带来严重风险。

Method: 采用句子级过程奖励模型，基于临床上下文和前置文本预测每个生成句子的真实性，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调。

Result: 轻量级0.5B参数PRM在多个指标上优于现有验证技术，在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，能有效过滤低质量报告并提升临床指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了无需内部激活的模型无关安全层，显著提升了放射学报告生成的安全性。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed

*Mohammed Aljafari,Ismail Alturki,Ahmed Mori,Yehya Kadumi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mubeen是一个专有的阿拉伯语语言模型，通过深度语言工程框架优化，专注于阿拉伯语言学、伊斯兰研究和文化遗产的深度理解，采用原生阿拉伯语源确保文化真实性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有阿拉伯语模型依赖英语翻译数据导致的意图检测和检索增强生成失败问题，以及"效用差距危机"——事实正确的答案无法解决用户核心需求的问题。

Method: 使用专有阿拉伯OCR引擎数字化历史手稿扩展真实阿拉伯语源训练数据，结合深度语言工程框架和实践闭合架构，整合语言学、法学、圣训和古兰经注释等学术著作。

Result: 模型能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，掌握阿拉伯语的优雅表达，在文化保存和通用知识领域均表现稳健。

Conclusion: Mubeen从信息存储库转变为决定性指导工具，与沙特2030愿景保持一致，通过优先考虑清晰度和决定性指导来解决用户核心需求。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

*Bang Xiao,Lingjie Jiang,Shaohan Huang,Tengchao Lv,Yupan Huang,Xun Wu,Lei Cui,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个提升LLM生成代码美观度的新方法，包括构建AesCode-358K数据集、多代理奖励反馈系统和GRPO-AR算法，显著改善了代码美观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在传统编程任务中表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中美观度不足，需要专门的方法来提升代码美学质量。

Method: 构建AesCode-358K指令调优数据集；提出多代理奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美观度和交互美观度；开发GRPO-AR算法联合优化功能性和代码美观性；创建OpenDesign基准测试。

Result: 结合监督微调和强化学习显著提升了OpenDesign基准表现，AesCoder-4B模型超越了GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，性能与480B-685B参数的大型开源模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美观度，证明了专门针对代码美学的优化策略的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 第九届CHiME挑战赛引入多模态上下文感知识别任务，解决单房间环境中重叠对话的鸡尾酒会问题，使用音频、视觉和上下文线索，在极端语音重叠情况下识别说话者及其对话内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然多参与者对话中极端语音重叠（可达100%）和高度碎片化对话轮次的识别问题，通过多模态方法提升在嘈杂环境中的对话理解能力。

Method: 使用音频、视觉和上下文线索联合转录每个说话者的语音，并将其聚类到各自的对话中，数据收集基于非脚本化的随意群聊录音。

Result: 纯音频基线系统的词错误率超过100%，而加入视觉线索后性能提升约50%，证明了多模态方法的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态上下文感知识别是解决极端语音重叠环境中对话理解的有效方法，视觉线索对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

### [98] [DCMM-SQL: Automated Data-Centric Pipeline and Multi-Model Collaboration Training for Text-to-SQL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23284)
*Yuanzhen Xie,Liu Ye,Jiqun Chu,Mochi Gao,Hehuan Liu,Yunzhi Tan,Bo Hu,Zang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的数据为中心的方法来改进文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，并结合多模型协作训练和集成策略，在轻量级模型（70B以内）中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响很少被探索。现有方法主要依赖单一微调模型，其能力有限。

Method: 设计了全自动数据为中心流水线：自适应数据修复自动发现并修复训练数据中的错误；错误数据增强对初始模型预测的错误数据进行扩散和增强；多模型协作训练使用不同增强数据训练多个模型；集成策略整合多个模型能力解决多选题。

Result: 实验结果表明，数据为中心流水线和多模型交互迭代策略有效，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，证明了数据质量优化和模型多样性对任务效果的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

### [99] [Arabic Little STT: Arabic Children Speech Recognition Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23319)
*Mouhand Alkadri,Dania Desouki,Khloud Al Jallad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了阿拉伯语儿童语音数据集Arabic Little STT，包含288名6-13岁儿童的355条语音，并评估了Whisper模型在该数据集上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言中儿童语音数据严重缺乏的问题，填补儿童特定语音语料库的空白。

Method: 创建了Levantine阿拉伯语儿童课堂语音数据集，并系统评估了8个Whisper变体模型在该数据集上的表现，与成人阿拉伯语基准进行比较。

Result: 即使性能最好的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率高达0.66，远高于在成人数据集上的低于0.20的词错误率，与英语语音研究结果一致。

Conclusion: 强调ASR开发中需要专门的儿童语音基准和包容性训练数据，且此类数据必须遵循严格的伦理和隐私框架来保护敏感的儿童信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的块状搜索策略，通过自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于关键初始token，在LLM对齐任务中优于Best-of-N和微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍然是一个关键挑战。推理时方法提供了微调的灵活替代方案，但其统一的计算努力通常产生次优的对齐效果。我们假设对于许多对齐任务，响应的初始token更为关键。

Method: 引入AdaSearch，一种新颖的块状搜索策略。它使用采样计划自适应分配固定计算预算，将搜索努力集中在这些关键token上。应用于顺序解码并引入其树搜索对应物AdaBeam。

Result: 在八个LLM上的综合评估表明，AdaSearch优于强大的Best-of-N和微调基线。具体而言，在无害生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务中，相对于Best-of-N，胜率提高了超过10%。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过专注于关键初始token，有效提升了LLM对齐任务的性能，证明了自适应计算分配在推理时对齐方法中的重要性。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

### [101] [BaZi-Based Character Simulation Benchmark: Evaluating AI on Temporal and Persona Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23337)
*Siyuan Zheng,Pai Liu,Xi Chen,Jizheng Dong,Sihan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于八字命理的人物推理QA数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型结合，生成时间动态和细粒度的虚拟人物，相比主流LLM准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟人物生成方法依赖标注数据或人工设定，难以扩展且难以生成真实、上下文一致的人物。需要一种能够生成文化背景丰富、时间动态变化的人物模拟方法。

Method: 创建八字命理人物推理QA数据集，将人类经验分类为财富、健康、亲属、职业和关系等维度，并设计BaZi-LLM系统整合符号推理与大语言模型。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%；当使用错误八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%，验证了文化基础符号-LLM整合的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于文化基础的符号推理与LLM整合在真实人物模拟方面具有巨大潜力，能够生成更真实、上下文一致的虚拟人物。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightKGG是一个使用小型语言模型(SLMs)从文本数据中高效提取知识图谱的框架，通过上下文集成图提取和拓扑增强关系推断两个关键技术，在低资源环境下实现准确的知识图谱构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量知识图谱稀缺的问题，现有方法依赖错误率高的模式匹配技术或资源密集型大语言模型(LLMs)，计算需求限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 采用两个关键技术：(1)上下文集成图提取：将上下文信息与节点和边集成到统一图结构中；(2)拓扑增强关系推断：利用提取图的固有拓扑结构高效推断关系。

Result: 能够在最小硬件需求下实现准确的知识图谱构建，弥合了自动化知识提取与实际部署场景之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为优化SLM在结构化NLP任务中的效率引入了科学严谨的方法，使低资源环境也能进行高效的知识图谱提取。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大语言模型预测AI对就业影响的基准，结合了美国部门级职位发布数据和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，评估了不同提示策略在劳动力预测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但目前缺乏系统预测AI对就业影响的工具。现有研究表明LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少有工作评估其在前瞻性劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 构建了一个结合美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据的基准，采用时间分割避免信息泄露，评估了任务支架、角色驱动和混合提示策略在不同模型家族中的表现。

Result: 结构化任务提示持续提高了预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上表现更好，但性能在不同部门和预测时间跨度上差异显著，表明需要领域感知提示和严格评估协议。

Conclusion: 这项工作为劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究提供了可复现的测试平台，有助于理解LLMs与现实经济数据交互的局限性和机会。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了基于规则的方法和大型语言模型在检测气候相关文本中宗教语言的效果，发现基于规则的方法标记更多句子为宗教语言，揭示了宗教语言检测的方法学挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宗教语言在当代气候辩论等世俗领域中持续存在，需要研究如何计算检测宗教语言在气候相关文本中的表现形式。

Method: 采用双重方法：基于生态神学文献构建宗教术语层次树的规则模型，以及在零样本设置下运行的大型语言模型，分析超过88万个句子。

Result: 基于规则的方法比LLMs更一致地将更多句子标记为宗教语言，两种方法在检测结果上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了宗教语言检测的方法学挑战，以及宗教语言应仅由词汇定义还是由上下文意义定义的根本张力，展示了数字方法在宗教研究中的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合专家(MoE)框架的时间序列预测模型，整合了xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST和minGRU等多种SOTA模型，通过基于Transformer的门控网络实现，在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有TSF模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对时间序列预测领域Transformer模型有效性的争议，以及TSF数据倾向于近期历史且易受不可预测事件影响的特点，需要开发更强大的预测框架。

Method: 使用混合专家(MoE)框架，整合xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST、minGRU等多样化SOTA模型，通过基于Transformer的门控网络进行集成。

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有时间序列预测模型，包括最新的MoE框架方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE框架通过整合多种互补的SOTA模型，在时间序列预测任务中取得了最佳性能，证明了混合专家方法在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型面临两个基本挑战：模态不平衡（主要关注文本和图像，对其他模态支持有限）和偏好刚性（固定二元偏好对无法捕捉个性化偏好的复杂性）。

Method: 包含三个部分：Omni-RewardBench（首个多模态奖励模型基准）、Omni-RewardData（多模态偏好数据集）、Omni-RewardModel（判别式和生成式奖励模型）。

Result: 在Omni-RewardBench和其他广泛使用的奖励建模基准上取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: Omni-Reward是朝着通用多模态奖励建模迈出的重要一步，支持自由形式偏好，涵盖文本、图像、视频、音频和3D等多种模态。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM搜索代理在多轮交互中表达置信度的能力，并提出了基于置信度的测试时缩放方法，在保持竞争力的同时显著减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景下的置信度，而对复杂多轮交互中置信度的研究有限。本文旨在探索LLM搜索代理能否在长序列动作后通过语言化置信分数来表达自身置信度。

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，发现模型在高置信度时任务准确率更高，低置信度时准确率接近零。基于此观察，提出了测试时缩放方法，使用置信分数确定答案质量，鼓励模型重试直到达到满意的置信水平。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型在高置信度时表现出更高的任务准确率，而低置信度时准确率接近零。提出的测试时缩放方法显著减少了token消耗，同时与基线固定预算方法相比表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够在多轮交互中有效表达置信度，基于置信度的测试时缩放方法在减少计算资源消耗的同时保持了性能竞争力，为复杂交互场景下的不确定性评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

Result: 少样本结合思维链提示表现最佳，优于监督基线，LLM在SEC和ECT数据集上的表现存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在不需大量标注数据的情况下，利用LLM进行金融领域特定目标立场检测的可行性。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

*Tengchao Yang,Sichen Guo,Mengzhao Jia,Jiaming Su,Yuanyang Liu,Zhihan Zhang,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个AI数学辅导基准MMTutorBench，包含685个围绕关键教学步骤构建的问题，评估12个主流MLLM在洞察发现、操作制定和执行三个任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多忽视了数学辅导所需的诊断学生困难和逐步引导的能力，而这是有效数学辅导的关键技能。

Method: 构建包含685个问题的MMTutorBench基准，每个问题配有特定评分标准，评估六个维度，并结构化分为洞察发现、操作制定和操作执行三个任务。

Result: 发现专有和开源系统间存在明显性能差距，与人类导师相比仍有很大提升空间；OCR流程会降低辅导质量，少样本提示效果有限，基于评分标准的LLM-as-a-Judge方法可靠性高。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench既展示了AI数学辅导的难度，也证明了其在诊断AI辅导能力方面的价值，有助于推动AI辅导技术的发展。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M4FC是一个新的多模态事实核查数据集，包含4,982张图像和6,980个声明，涵盖10种语言和6个多模态事实核查任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态自动事实核查数据集存在样本少、语言单一、证据泄露或依赖外部新闻源等问题，需要更全面的数据集来推进研究。

Method: 构建M4FC数据集，包含专业事实核查机构验证的图像和声明，涵盖多种文化和地理背景，提供六个多模态事实核查任务的基线结果。

Result: 创建了包含4,982张图像和6,980个声明的数据集，涵盖10种语言，为六个多模态事实核查任务提供了基准性能。

Conclusion: M4FC数据集解决了现有数据集的局限性，为多模态事实核查研究提供了更全面的资源，并分析了中间任务对最终核查性能的影响。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了IPQA基准，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，发现现有语言模型在识别用户核心意图方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准只评估回答质量或检索性能，缺乏对意图识别能力的直接评估，而理解用户优先考虑的核心意图对生成满足个性化信息需求的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于满意理论，从用户选择答案的可观察行为模式中推导核心意图，通过系统筛选、基于LLM的标注以及结合自动验证和人工验证的严格质量控制构建多领域数据集。

Result: 实验评估显示，现有最先进的语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，随着问题复杂度增加，性能进一步下降。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的核心意图识别方法，IPQA基准和数据集将公开发布以促进该方向的研究。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一种使用少量高质量合成数据进行微调的LLM重排序模型，在推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索任务中表现优异，仅需不到5%的传统训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖大规模微调来适应信息重排序任务，计算成本高昂。本文旨在证明现代LLM可以通过最小化高质量监督有效适应重排序任务。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性和真实性的重排序示例，使用这些合成数据微调LIMRANK重排序模型。

Result: LIMRANK在BRIGHT（推理密集型检索）和FollowIR（指令跟随检索）两个基准测试中达到竞争性性能，同时训练数据量仅为先前工作的不到5%。

Conclusion: LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER有效且LIMRANK在下游任务（包括科学文献搜索和知识密集型问题解决的检索增强生成）中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别希望语音已成为重要的NLP任务，需要在社交媒体平台上检测具有动力的表达和以目标为导向的行为。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在已分割的希望语音数据集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中线性核SVM和逻辑回归的宏F1为0.78，RBF核SVM为0.77，朴素贝叶斯为0.75。Transformer模型表现更好，最佳模型加权精度0.82，加权召回率0.80，加权F1为0.79，宏F1为0.79，准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍然灵活，但transformer架构能够检测希望语音中一些微妙的语义，在小数据集上获得更高的精度和召回率，表明大型transformer和LLM在小型数据集上可能表现更好。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BR-RM是一种两阶段奖励模型，通过分支和重新思考机制减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性，在多个奖励建模基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单次标量评分，导致注意力分散和判断扩散问题，而大型语言模型的思考模型已证明二次思考能显著提升推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段自适应分支选择关键维度并生成证据寻求假设；第二阶段执行分支条件重新思考，针对性测试假设并只关注最重要内容。使用GRPO风格的强化学习训练结构化两阶段轨迹。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明该方法能有效减少判断扩散并提高对细微错误的敏感性。

Conclusion: BR-RM成功将二次思考原则应用于奖励建模，将一次性评分转化为聚焦的二次审视推理，在保持实用性和可扩展性的同时显著提升了奖励模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

TL;DR: 分析两期两市场的连锁店博弈，研究部分可观测性如何产生跨市场声誉溢出效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当在位者在一个市场的行为只能部分被另一个市场观察到时，这种部分可观测性如何影响跨市场的声誉建立和战略互动。

Method: 使用两期两市场的连锁店博弈模型，分析不同先验声誉下的均衡行为，并考察可观测性变化、噪声信号和内生信息获取的影响。

Result: 高先验声誉时，战略在位者会对抗早期单独进入者；低先验声誉时，会对单个进入者混合策略，协调进入时则容纳。更高可观测性会增加早期对抗，但也因容纳行为更易被注意到而增加后期进入。

Conclusion: 部分可观测性会产生跨市场声誉溢出，结果对噪声信号和内生信息获取具有稳健性，并可自然扩展到多市场情形。

Abstract: We analyze a two-period, two-market chain-store game in which an incumbent's
conduct in one market is only sometimes seen in the other. This partial
observability generates reputational spillovers across markets. We characterize
equilibrium behavior by prior reputation: at high priors the strategic
incumbent fights a lone early entrant (and mixes when both arrive together); at
low priors it mixes against a single entrant and accommodates coordinated
entry. Greater observability increases early fighting yet, because any
accommodation is more widely noticed, raises the incidence of later entry. The
results are robust to noisy signals and endogenous information acquisition, and
extend naturally to many markets.

*Pau Juan-Bartroli,José Ignacio Rivero-Wildemauwe*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合社会偏好和道德关注来解释最后通牒博弈中正报价被拒绝的现象，发现恶意是社会偏好的必要条件，而道德关注则放大这种偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释最后通牒博弈中正报价被拒绝的不同动机，提供一个统一的解释框架。

Method: 结合社会偏好和道德关注构建模型，使用有限混合方法估计个体的社会偏好和道德关注。

Result: 恶意是拒绝正报价的必要充分条件；拒绝阈值随个体道德关注增加而提高；识别出两种在最后通牒博弈中拒绝正报价但在独裁者博弈中行为不同的个体类型。

Conclusion: 社会偏好而非道德关注驱动拒绝行为，但道德关注作为社会偏好的放大器发挥作用。

Abstract: Rejections of positive offers in the Ultimatum Game have been attributed to
different motivations. We show that a model combining social preferences and
moral concerns provides a unifying explanation for these rejections while
accounting for additional evidence. Under the preferences considered, a
positive degree of spite is a necessary and sufficient condition for rejecting
positive offers. This indicates that social preferences, rather than moral
concerns, drive rejection behavior. This does not imply that moral concerns do
not matter. We show that rejection thresholds increase with individuals' moral
concerns, suggesting that morality acts as an amplifier of social preferences.
Using data from van Leeuwen and Alger (2024), we estimate individuals' social
preferences and moral concerns using a finite mixture approach. Consistent with
previous evidence, we identify two types of individuals who reject positive
offers in the Ultimatum Game, but that differ in their Dictator Game behavior.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个动态共享基础设施系统模型，结合政治经济学、社会生态系统和政治心理学理论，分析政治过程特征如何影响基础设施系统对容量冲击和私人投资机会不平等的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有政治经济模型未考虑动态基础设施、动态用户偏好和非理性行为理论，而工程学又往往忽视政治因素，因此需要建立一个综合模型来填补这些研究空白。

Method: 开发了一个通用的动态共享基础设施系统模型，整合了政治经济学、社会生态系统和政治心理学的理论框架。

Result: 研究发现：用户收费制度下不平等会降低稳健性；对私人基础设施使用征税可提高稳健性（前提是非精英群体有平等政治影响力）；选举周期对稳健性有非线性影响；候选人的意识形态敏感性与稳健性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 选民和候选人的偏见（支持增税或减税）调节了这些政治经济效应对稳健性的影响，因为这些偏见可能与系统实际需求（是否需要增税来恢复系统）不匹配。

Abstract: Our infrastructure systems enable our well-being by allowing us to move,
store, and transform materials and information given considerable social and
environmental variation. Critically, this ability is shaped by the degree to
which society invests in infrastructure, a fundamentally political question in
large public systems. There, infrastructure providers are distinguished from
users through political processes, such as elections, and there is considerable
heterogeneity among users. Previous political economic models have not taken
into account (i) dynamic infrastructures, (ii) dynamic user preferences, and
(iii) alternatives to rational actor theory. Meanwhile, engineering often
neglects politics. We address these gaps with a general dynamic model of shared
infrastructure systems that incorporates theories from political economy,
social-ecological systems, and political psychology. We use the model to
develop propositions on how multiple characteristics of the political process
impact the robustness of shared infrastructure systems to capacity shocks and
unequal opportunity for private infrastructure investment. Under user fees,
inequality decreases robustness, but taxing private infrastructure use can
increase robustness if non-elites have equal political influence. Election
cycle periods have a nonlinear effect where increasing them increases
robustness up to a point but decreases robustness beyond that point. Further,
there is a negative relationship between the ideological sensitivity of
candidates and robustness. Overall, the biases of voters and candidates
(whether they favor tax increases or decreases) mediate these
political-economic effects on robustness because biases may or may not match
the reality of system needs (whether system recovery requires tax increases).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完全信息匹配市场中传统贝叶斯稳定性无法排除恐惧驱动匹配的问题，连接信念基础和信息基础的稳定性概念。

Method: 引入信息可信对稳定性，允许配对在决定是否阻断前使用可信、有成本的信息测试来揭示匹配相关信息。

Result: ICPS严格精化贝叶斯稳定性，确保任何ICPS阻断偏差都会严格增加总期望剩余，ICPS稳定分配始终存在且促进正向分类匹配。

Conclusion: ICPS为不完全信息匹配市场提供了一个统一的分析框架，在测试信息性不足时退化为贝叶斯稳定性，在测试完美免费时等同于完全信息稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, I develop a refinement of stability for matching markets with
incomplete information. I introduce Information-Credible Pairwise Stability
(ICPS), a solution concept in which deviating pairs can use credible, costly
tests to reveal match-relevant information before deciding whether to block. By
leveraging the option value of information, ICPS strictly refines Bayesian
stability, rules out fear-driven matchings, and connects belief-based and
information-based notions of stability. ICPS collapses to Bayesian stability
when testing is uninformative or infeasible and coincides with
complete-information stability when testing is perfect and free. I show that
any ICPS-blocking deviation strictly increases total expected surplus, ensuring
welfare improvement. I also prove that ICPS-stable allocations always exist,
promote positive assortative matching, and are unique when the test power is
sufficiently strong. The framework extends to settings with non-transferable
utility, correlated types, and endogenous or sequential testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在动态全支付拍卖中，不同中期反馈政策如何影响玩家的竞价行为和均衡结果，特别是对沉没成本效应和沮丧效应的影响。

Method: 使用理论模型分析Cheapest Signal Equilibria，并通过实验设计四种反馈政策处理（完全反馈、排名反馈和两种截断政策）来检验理论预测。

Result: 均衡状态下玩家收益为零，总期望出价等于奖品价值。实验结果显示竞价行为偏离理论均衡，但反馈政策对总出价无显著影响，存在沉没成本和沮丧效应。

Conclusion: 尽管竞价行为偏离理论预测，但中期反馈政策在动态全支付拍卖中对总出价没有显著影响，沉没成本和头起效应在第二阶段竞价中显现。

Abstract: We study the effect of interim feedback policies in a dynamic all-pay auction
where two players bid over two stages to win a common-value prize. We show that
sequential equilibrium outcomes are characterized by Cheapest Signal
Equilibria, wherein stage 1 bids are such that one player bids zero while the
other chooses a cheapest bid consistent with some signal. Equilibrium payoffs
for both players are always zero, and the sum of expected total bids equals the
value of the prize. We conduct an experiment with four natural feedback policy
treatments -- full, rank, and two cutoff policies -- and while the bidding
behavior deviates from equilibrium, we fail to reject the hypothesis of no
treatment effect on total bids. Further, stage 1 bids induce sunk costs and
head starts, and we test for the resulting sunk cost and discouragement effects
in stage 2 bidding.

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖显式反馈或微调带来的用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私问题，实现更高效的个性化文本生成。

Method: 基于Critique-and-Refine范式，从用户交互历史构建伪用户代理，生成用户特定评估标准，让代理基于这些标准对输出进行批判和优化。

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上的自动评估显示，PREFINE相比基线方法获得更高的胜率和统计显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量。

Conclusion: PREFINE框架在个性化故事生成方面表现优异，其伪用户代理和用户特定评估标准都是提升个性化性能的关键组件，可扩展到对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

Motivation: 现实AI系统面临越来越复杂的问题，当多个LLM智能体形成不一致的约定时，协调会失效。协作编码和分布式规划等应用需要可靠、一致的通信，且系统扩展性是核心关注点。

Method: 引入SIGN（基于模式的命名游戏），通过轻量级结构来引导约定形成，比较基于模式的通信与无约束自然语言的效果。

Result: 基于模式的通信相比无约束自然语言能实现更快收敛，协议一致性提高达5.8倍。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力上限，参数规模扩大时准确率几乎不提升，而损失持续下降，表明这些模型架构存在特定能力扩展失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究解码器自回归语言模型在不同规模下的能力扩展模式，特别是知识密集型任务与程序性任务的差异，为资源分配决策提供依据。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族（70M-30B参数），分析损失与准确率的关系，进行注意力干预实验观察模型对扰动的敏感性。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率几乎无提升，MMLU数学基准准确率稳定在19-20%，而损失下降31%；程序性任务则显示传统扩展模式；注意力干预导致性能崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于OPT和Pythia架构的知识密集型应用，参数规模超过1-2B后准确率增益极小，存在特定能力扩展失败，需要研究这是架构固有约束还是实现限制。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过包含详细推理链的训练数据显著提升了多模态大语言模型在几何推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在文本数学推理中表现良好，但在几何推理任务中性能显著下降，主要因为几何问题的内在复杂性（需要详细图像理解和多步推理）以及现有数据集缺乏规模、多样性和明确推理轨迹。

Method: 构建了包含6,243个样本的Geo-Thought-6K数据集和10,834个样本的Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K数据集，每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、明确推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此数据集开发了GeoThought-MLLM多模态推理模型。

Result: 模型在几何任务中超越了现有基准，在领域内和领域外设置下都显示出几何推理能力的提升。错误分析表明主要错误源于数学概念错误理解或空间判断错误，通过思维链可以纠正这些错误。

Conclusion: 使用包含详细推理链的数据集训练可以显著提高多模态模型在几何推理任务中的性能，思维链方法有助于识别和纠正推理过程中的错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

TL;DR: 将生成流网络应用于旅行商问题、最小生成树和最短路径三个图优化问题，通过训练学习采样与奖励函数成比例的解决方案，生成结果与传统算法一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型在组合优化问题中的应用，利用学习策略解决传统算法在规模扩展时可能面临的挑战。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，顺序构建解决方案：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行选择城市。

Result: 在不同规模的基准实例上，GFlowNets学会了找到最优解，生成解与经典算法（Dijkstra、Kruskal、TSP精确求解器）的结果一致。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性：传统算法每个实例有固定复杂度，而GFlowNets通过训练分摊计算成本。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线性函数逼近框架下强化学习的计算复杂度，证明了在部分qπ可实现性设定中学习ε最优策略是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在部分qπ可实现性这一新的线性函数逼近框架下的计算复杂度问题，该框架假设策略集中所有策略的价值函数都是线性可实现的，比qπ可实现性弱但比q*可实现性强。

Method: 通过从δ-Max-3SAT和δ-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-κ-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-κ-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算复杂度下界。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下学习ε最优策略是NP难的，在softmax策略集下（除非NP=RP）存在指数级下界。

Conclusion: 在部分qπ可实现性框架下，获得正面的计算结果通常不可行，这与生成访问模型下的qπ可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用10亿参数的小型开源模型作为商业大语言模型在电商意图识别任务中的高效替代方案，通过QLoRA微调和后训练量化技术，实现了与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业大语言模型在专业任务部署时面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用QLoRA方法对10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型进行微调，在合成的多语言电商查询数据集上进行训练，然后应用GPTQ和GGUF后训练量化技术。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，与GPT-4.1性能相当。GPTQ量化减少41%显存但推理速度下降82%，GGUF在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上内存消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用更合适的替代方案，能以极低计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分布偏移对齐（DSA）的两阶段微调方法，用于提高LLM模拟人类调查响应的准确性，显著减少真实数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，而传统微调方法过度拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: DSA是一种两阶段微调方法，通过同时对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布偏移，学习这些分布如何变化而非拟合训练数据。

Result: 在五个公开调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，可将真实数据需求减少53.48-69.12%，在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DSA通过关注分布变化而非数据拟合，能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，证明了在调查模拟中的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理基础模型，通过设备-云协作解决移动设备上小模型性能不足与大模型部署成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI代理面临困境：真正在设备上的小模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而有能力的大模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法移动部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云的闭源MLLM）。

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型，集成高效长推理机制，默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将挑战性子任务升级到云端。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验显示，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型的性能，同时显著降低云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作有效解决了移动GUI代理的性能与成本平衡问题，为移动平台提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Motivation: 传统元强化学习在部分可观测环境中虽然能获得近似贝叶斯最优策略，但无法学习紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态，这限制了智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 将自监督预测编码模块集成到元强化学习中，受神经科学中的预测编码理论和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发。

Result: 在状态机模拟中，带有预测模块的元强化学习始终生成更可解释的表示，更好地近似贝叶斯最优信念状态。在需要主动信息搜索的挑战性任务中，只有带预测模块的元强化学习成功学习到最优表示和策略。

Conclusion: 预测学习作为指导原则，在部分可观测环境中促进有效的表示学习，带来更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习系统虽然达到最先进的预测性能，但因果不透明：内部表示缺乏因果语义，无法进行精确的机制编辑。需要转向能够构建可测试、可修正因果解释的智能系统。

Method: 引入计算解释和能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)，将机制表达为约束（能量函数或向量场）而非显式输入输出映射，通过局部手术实现干预。

Result: 在ESCM框架下实例化了结构因果原则LAP和ICM，分析了经验风险最小化导致纠缠表示的问题，并在温和条件下恢复了标准SCM语义。

Conclusion: 为因果推理提供了形式化语言，使系统能够理解而不仅仅是预测，实现了内部结构在解释层面的可操作性。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

TL;DR: 该立场论文提出从脑机接口(BCI)向脑-智能体协作(BAC)的范式扩展，强调将智能体重新定义为主动协作伙伴而非被动信号处理器，需要关注伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口存在信息传输率低和用户特定校准等限制，虽然大型语言模型的整合有所进展，但部署智能AI面临技术障碍和伦理问题，需要对该新兴方向进行综合讨论。

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，通过论证分析提出范式扩展的概念框架，强调重新定义智能体角色，并建立相应的技术伦理框架。

Result: 提出了从BCI到BAC的范式转变概念，将智能体定位为主动协作伙伴，要求关注伦理、可靠性和协作框架等关键要素。

Conclusion: 脑-智能体协作系统需要确保安全、可信和有效，这要求重点关注伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和稳健的人-智能体协作框架。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dopamine的基于神经强化学习的无导数优化器，用于训练神经网络，通过权重扰动学习来避免反向传播的计算和内存问题，实现更高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播在信用分配问题中的效率不足，包括计算成本高、内存消耗大以及权重传输和更新锁定问题，寻求更符合神经生物学原理的优化方法。

Method: 采用权重扰动学习，通过最小化期望结果与实际结果之间的奖励预测误差来调整学习率，实现自适应学习率策略，类似于大脑中多巴胺的作用。

Result: 在XOR任务和混沌时间序列预测任务中，Dopamine优化器训练的多层感知机和循环神经网络表现出加速收敛，性能优于标准权重扰动方法，与基于梯度的算法相当，同时计算和内存消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了稳健的解决方案，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且在神经生物学上更具合理性。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

TL;DR: OptiTree提出了一种基于树搜索的自适应问题分解方法，通过将复杂运筹学问题分解为更简单的子问题来提升建模能力，相比现有方法在基准测试上取得了超过10%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定步骤分解来生成变量、约束和目标，但由于运筹学问题具有高度复杂的数学结构，这种方法往往无法达到高性能。

Method: 开发了一个建模树，基于运筹学问题的层次化问题分类和复杂度来组织问题，每个节点代表一个问题类别并包含相关的高层建模思路。通过递归搜索树来识别更简单的子问题，并自适应地整合层次化思路来合成全局建模思路。

Conclusion: OptiTree通过自适应问题分解和层次化思路整合，有效提升了复杂运筹学问题的建模能力，为自动化建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了PACR（渐进式上升置信度奖励），一种密集的模型内在奖励，通过模型对正确答案信念的演化来加速RLVR训练中的探索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间步骤提供指导，导致探索缓慢。需要一种密集的奖励信号来引导推理过程。

Method: PACR直接计算模型对正确答案信念的演化概率，编码了沿着良好推理轨迹时正确答案概率应呈现上升趋势的归纳偏置。

Result: PACR加速了探索，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，并在多个基准测试中取得了改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique
challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains
largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these
issues. Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant
limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in
non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the
VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing
multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics
and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while
demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language
and music.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale
instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work
introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing
tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed

Motivation: 现有的多模态数学推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集容易导致数据污染和记忆，且仅通过最终答案评估模型，忽略了推理过程。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建DynaSolidGeo基准，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可以动态生成多样化多模态文本-视觉实例，并基于专家标注的推理链进行过程评估。

Result: 实验显示代表性开源和闭源视觉语言模型存在较大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高水平空间智能的任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何空间推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: ICR算法能有效提升LLM代理在协作任务中处理干预和建立群体共识的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的发展加剧了数据隐私担忧，需要选择性遗忘学习信息的能力，但现有基准缺乏图像多样性、准确性不足且评估场景有限。

Method: 构建基于足球转会谣言的手动策划数据集，包含四个测试集评估不同方面，支持选择性遗忘、纠正再学习和单模态遗忘等高级设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著漏洞，需要更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can

### [150] [ATOM: AdapTive and OptiMized dynamic temporal knowledge graph construction using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22590)
*Yassir Lairgi,Ludovic Moncla,Khalid Benabdeslem,Rémy Cazabet,Pierre Cléau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATOM是一个少样本、可扩展的方法，能从非结构化文本中构建和持续更新时序知识图谱，通过将文档分解为原子事实并采用双时间建模，显著提高了提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了数据的动态性和时效性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法存在不稳定和覆盖不完整的问题，需要一种能适应连续变化的方法。

Method: 将输入文档分解为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息被观察到的时间与有效时间，最后并行合并原子图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的完整性提升、约17%的稳定性改善，以及超过90%的延迟减少，显示出强大的动态时序知识图谱构建可扩展性。

Conclusion: ATOM方法通过原子事实分解和双时间建模，有效解决了时序知识图谱构建中的完整性和稳定性问题，为动态知识提取提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

*Bingqing Song,Jiaxiang Li,Rong Wang,Songtao Lu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析上下文学习性能的新框架，研究预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，如何通过适当构建的上下文将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，从而提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现了强大的上下文学习能力，但理论上尚不清楚这种能力如何产生，特别是预训练过程和上下文构建等关键因素的确切作用。

Method: 构建一个单层transformer的简单示例，然后扩展到更一般情况，推导ICL性能、上下文长度与预训练和查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确关系，并通过实验验证理论结果。

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，这种转移是可量化的，能够提高查询主题的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 论文建立了一个理论框架来分析ICL性能，揭示了上下文在弥合预训练分布与查询任务分布差异中的作用，并提供了可量化的性能关系。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

*Md. Mehedi Hasan,Rafid Mostafiz,Md. Abir Hossain,Bikash Kumar Paul*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM是一个安全约束的混合管道系统，通过多模态患者编码、不确定性校准的疾病分类和检索增强的治疗生成，实现症状到疾病的准确分类和临床基础的治疗推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。在诊断风险高的异质患者环境中，准确分类和临床基础治疗推荐仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用1,200个临床案例微调BioBERT，结合Focal Loss和Monte Carlo Dropout实现置信度感知预测；使用Biomedical Sentence-BERT从26万样本的MedDialog语料库中检索相关对话；通过微调的FLAN-T5模型生成个性化治疗，并用RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: CLIN-LLM达到98%的准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT高出7.1%；78%的top-5检索精度；临床医生评定的有效性为4.2/5；与GPT-5相比，不安全抗生素建议减少67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了鲁棒性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了可部署的人机协作决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

*Adhyayan Veer Singh,Aaron Shen,Brian Law,Ahmed Ismail,Jonas Rohweder,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个面向竞赛编程的复杂度感知多智能体系统，通过算法规划与经验性性能分析相结合，确保程序不仅正确还满足时间和内存约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序虽然能通过单元测试，但经常违反竞赛的时间和内存限制，需要同时保证正确性和效率。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包括规划器提出算法草图、静态剪枝器过滤高风险计划、编码器生成C++代码、性能分析器执行性能测试、复杂度分析器分析算法复杂度并指导修复。

Result: 在26个问题上的测试显示，SwiftSolve在第一次尝试时达到61.54%的成功率，三次尝试内达到80.77%成功率，运行级成功率为73.08%，优于Claude Opus 4的52.6%。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度指导的重规划能有效减少低效率问题，同时保持准确性，证明了多智能体系统在竞赛编程中的有效性。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

*Yuval Kainan,Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于第一个生成token的log-probability分布来检测LLM模板化响应的方法，可在单步生成后实现高效分类，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成模板化响应（如拒绝、简单确认等）时消耗大量计算资源，增加了不必要的成本和延迟。

Method: 利用第一个生成token的log-probability向量作为分类信号，使用轻量级k-NN分类器预测响应类型。

Result: 实验表明不同响应类型的第一个token log-probability向量形成明显可分离的簇，分类准确率高。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且计算简单的技术，通过早期终止或重定向到较小模型来优化LLM推理，实现显著的计算成本节约。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Atlas Urban Index (AUI)指标，利用视觉语言模型和Sentinel-2卫星影像来更准确地测量城市发展，克服传统指标如NDBI的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NDBI由于大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素，难以准确捕捉城市发展，这阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2影像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以减少云层覆盖，使用视觉语言模型提供发展评分，并采用参考图像和最近历史图像来确保评分一致性。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指标。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指数的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过在检索前阶段生成对比性问题来引导模型关注关键差异，从而在单次检索中抑制语义干扰，提高对知识稀疏和语义模糊长尾查询的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询中面临的检索噪声问题，这些噪声会扭曲推理并需要昂贵的后处理。

Method: 提出RaCoT框架，在检索前自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比性问题，提取Δ-Prompt来捕捉关键差异，引导模型主动关注决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线方法性能提升0.9-2.4个百分点，在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法超过15%的下降。具有低延迟(3.12秒)和低token开销(11.54)的优势。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重新定义为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署提供了高效且可靠的AI系统路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

Motivation: 随着各大公司开发出更好的LLM，了解不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，这些差异源于它们不同的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成，对五个顶级LLM进行比较评估。

Result: Claude在道德推理方面表现良好，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面更强，DeepSeek在基于事实的推理方面出色，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重使用体验。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效率、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据各自优势来选择最适合的模型。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

Motivation: 解决LLM自信生成听起来完全合理但实际上是虚假信息的幻觉问题，这是在实际应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成过程中的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正同时保持回答的自然流畅性。

Result: 跨多个领域测试显示幻觉减少67%，医疗、金融和科学研究领域的专家对纠正后输出的满意度达89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在事实准确性至关重要的应用中使LLM更可信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Motivation: 现有方法要么学习概念标记集，要么训练VLM使用用户特定信息，但都难以生成准确的个性化回答。

Method: 将用户特定信息存储在文本和视觉token的KV-Caches中，通过检索相关KV-Caches来确保回答准确性。

Result: Jarvis能够提供更准确的响应，特别是在依赖特定局部细节时，在多个数据集上达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: 当前AI代理开发缺乏对人类工作方式的深入理解，需要明确代理在多样化工作流程中的专业能力和角色定位。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，并比较两者在相同任务上的表现。

Result: 代理工作流程与人类对齐但过度程序化，工作质量较差且存在数据伪造，但效率显著更高、成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 通过将易编程任务委托给代理，可以实现高效的人机协作，但需注意代理的质量问题和行为偏差。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Motivation: 微软Copilot套件作为通用入口点，需要强大的编排器来将用户提示的任务分发给合适的代理，支持动态扩展的代理库。

Method: 使用Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO)，结合元学习训练决策树模型来决定不同代理/模型之间的最佳推理策略。

Result: 通过两个生产用例展示了AMO的有效性：M365电子商务Copilot提供最新产品信息并连接多个代理；代码合规Copilot扫描内部DevOps代码检测合规问题。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理多任务和可扩展代理，为Copilot服务提供强大的任务分发能力。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

TL;DR: 该论文研究让强化学习智能体在训练过程中考虑计算成本，从而在保持性能的同时显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在熟练掌握任务后会减少认知努力，而传统强化学习智能体在提升性能时通常不会变得更高效。如果智能体能在学习过程中考虑计算成本，就能实现更节能的智能体或释放计算资源用于其他任务。

Method: 在Arcade Learning Environment中实验，向智能体展示计算成本并赋予它们控制计算使用的自主权。

Result: 在相同训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，且平均使用三倍更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体考虑计算成本可以显著提高计算效率，同时保持或提升性能表现。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Conclusion: CoreThink框架有效解决了智能体推理系统的泛化问题，在保持低计算成本的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

Motivation: 现有POI推荐模型难以同时捕捉空间选择的层次结构和用户特定时间上下文的动态变化，存在根本性局限。

Method: 采用跨流形条件路由：在双曲几何中建模静态树状偏好层次，在欧几里得切空间中用Mamba层处理动态序列更新，通过跨流形通道融合时空信息指导状态空间模型。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，GTR-Mamba在下一个POI推荐任务中持续优于最先进的基线模型。

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形建模有效解决了POI推荐中时空特征联合建模的挑战，为复杂人类移动决策过程提供了更好的建模方法。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了去中心化资源管理的关键挑战，理论保证和实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Motivation: 当前生成语义约束对抗样本的方法在攻击能力上存在不足，主要原因是未能充分研究人类指令中的语义不确定性因素，如指称多样性、描述不完整性和边界模糊性。

Method: 提出了InSUR框架，包含三个维度：1）采样方法维度-残差驱动攻击方向稳定化，使用ResAdv-DDIM采样器稳定对抗优化；2）任务建模维度-上下文编码攻击场景约束，通过指导掩码和渲染器集成补充缺失知识；3）生成器评估维度-语义抽象攻击评估增强，明确评估边界。

Result: 大量实验证明了InSUR在迁移攻击性能上的优越性，并首次实现了无需参考的语义约束3D对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过多维度减少指令不确定性，能够生成更有效的语义约束对抗样本，在可迁移性和适应性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Method: 耦合事后解释器(SHAP、LIME、Anchor)与检索增强LLMs，索引多模态知识库，基于量化标准选择解释器，使用聊天式提示生成基于知识的解释。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上评估：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡上表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低token的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定token使用并保持各用户配置文件的正向评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI能够实现高效可信的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但通过配置文件条件化可以稳定token使用并维持用户满意度。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity-robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy

Motivation: 现有扩散规划器采用稀疏步长规划优于单步规划，但过度稀疏会降低性能。作者假设时间密度阈值在时间范围内是非均匀的，轨迹的某些部分应该更密集地规划。

Method: 提出Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD)，一种扩散规划器，其中整个时间范围内的密度是可调节的超参数。

Result: MDD在Maze2D、Franka Kitchen和Antmaze D4RL任务领域达到了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过可调节的非均匀时间密度，MDD能够更好地平衡长期依赖关系和规划性能，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Conclusion: 小型语言模型可以被成功转化为有效的奖励模型，用于代码质量评估，显著提升了代码搜索和选择的能力。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了科学大语言模型(Sci-LLMs)处理生物分子序列的现有范式，发现提供高层次结构化上下文比直接处理原始序列更有效，且原始序列会作为信息噪声降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Sci-LLMs在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的tokenization困境——无论是将序列视为专门语言还是单独模态，都会限制模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过系统比较领先的Sci-LLMs在生物推理任务上的表现，测试了三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、以及两者结合。

Result: 仅使用上下文的方法在所有任务中始终且显著优于其他模式。更令人惊讶的是，在高质量上下文旁边加入原始序列会持续降低性能，表明原始序列即使对于具有专门tokenization方案的模型也充当信息噪声。

Conclusion: 现有Sci-LLMs的主要优势不在于从零开始解释生物分子语法的能力，而在于对结构化、人类可读知识进行推理的深刻能力。应将Sci-LLMs重新定位为专家知识的强大推理引擎，而非序列解码器。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

TL;DR: FoG方法通过基础模型将人类意图融入技能发现过程，消除不良行为并避免危险区域，同时学习难以明确定义的行为技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能发现方法只关注技能多样性最大化，不考虑人类偏好，导致产生不良甚至危险的行为。

Method: 从基础模型中提取评分函数，根据人类意图评估状态，将分数用于重新加权技能发现算法的奖励。

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、滚动等不良行为，在基于状态和像素的任务中都能避免危险区域。

Conclusion: FoG能够将人类意图有效融入技能发现过程，学习符合人类偏好的多样化技能。

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

TL;DR: AUPO是一种对MCTS决策策略的改进方法，通过自动动作抽象显著提升性能，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图，能检测对称动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MCTS决策策略，解决现有自动抽象算法需要转移概率和DAG搜索图的限制，同时能够检测对称动作。

Method: 基于MCTS过程中获得的奖励分布统计，开发自动动作抽象算法AUPO，仅影响决策策略。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上，AUPO明显优于标准MCTS，能够检测出ASAP等先进框架难以处理的对称动作。

Conclusion: AUPO是一种有效的MCTS改进方法，与其他仅影响树搜索的抽象技术兼容，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Conclusion: 该方法将替代手工制作的智能体，应用于该系列游戏的后续版本中，证明了其在工业环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BlocKOA的新算法，用于高效生成集成电路热仿真数据，相比现有方法实现420倍加速，同时保持数据精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大量高保真训练数据，计算成本高昂，限制了神经网络算子在集成电路热仿真中的应用。

Method: 使用基于热方程结构的块Krylov算法快速获取基础解，组合生成满足物理约束的温度分布，再应用热算子确定热源分布。

Result: BlocKOA时间复杂度和现有方法低一个数量级，生成5000个芯片热仿真数据实现420倍加速，仅用4%时间生成的数据训练模型性能相当。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能高效生成精确的集成电路热仿真数据，显著降低数据驱动方法的训练成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中的基本组件，用于产生纠缠。最小化CNOT门数量是一个重要的开放性问题，其计算复杂性尚未完全确定

Method: 使用单一强化学习智能体处理固定尺寸m的电路，对不同尺寸的矩阵采用嵌入或高斯条纹化预处理。训练了m=8的智能体，评估了n=3到15的电路

Result: 随着n值的增加，该方法的表现超过了现有最优算法

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在CNOT门最小化问题上显示出潜力，特别是在处理较大规模电路时优于传统算法

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于理性言语行为框架的自适应信号理论框架，用于优化人机协作中信息传递的时机和特异性，以在动态环境中保持用户认知与环境的及时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的动态环境中，为了确保人类对关键任务元素保持准确理解，辅助智能体需要识别最高优先级信息，并估计如何以及何时最有效地传递这些信息，因为人类注意力是有限的认知资源。

Method: 使用贝叶斯参考解析的理性言语行为建模框架，规划一系列消息序列，优化用户信念与动态环境的及时对齐。智能体根据用户和场景的具体情况，调整消息的特异性和时机，基于对消息解释如何影响界面注意力和后续信念更新的多步预测。

Conclusion: 为人类-智能体团队中的语用通信建立了理论基础，展示了如何利用认知科学见解来指导辅助智能体的设计。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific

extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good

AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

Conclusion: Bid2X作为竞价基础模型具有优越性能和跨场景泛化能力，为计算广告领域的竞价建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

TL;DR: 本文是对Cappelen等人关于AI生存风险分类分析的评论文章，重点讨论了线性风险模型的哲学局限性，分析了瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型的差异，并探讨了在认知漠视情境下AI生存风险概率的评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在提醒人们关注AI生存风险评估中线性模型的哲学局限性，强调在认知漠视情境下风险概率可能被低估，需要纳入不确定性维度来更准确地理解AI生存风险的可能性。

Method: 采用哲学分析方法，首先比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型的差异，然后论证在认知漠视情境下P(D)概率的结构性关系，最后区分风险与不确定性，提出影响P(D)评估的两种不确定性类型。

Result: 分析表明，在认知漠视情境下，由于结构层间关系，AI生存风险概率P(D)可能高于初步估计；同时识别出影响P(D)评估的两种关键不确定性：选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性。

Conclusion: 将不确定性维度纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论中，能够提供对P(D)可能性的更好理解，强调了在AI生存风险评估中考虑哲学局限性和不确定性因素的重要性。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、合规性和可审计性的访问决策，但传统方法难以将人类可读策略转化为机器决策。

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM，采用六阶段推理框架（上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射、风险综合），结合早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制。

Result: 在14个标准案例上的评估显示：策略门控后精确决策匹配从10/14提升到13/14（92.9%），拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝类别的误批准率降为0，功能适当性和合规性均为14/14。

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计跟踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追溯的机器决策。

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Conclusion: 人类-AI协作不确定性量化框架能够有效结合人类和AI的优势，在不确定性量化任务中实现更好的性能，为可靠决策提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出情感理由验证器(ERV)和解释奖励方法，解决多模态大语言模型在情感识别中预测与解释不一致的问题，提高解释-预测一致性和情感准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在情感理解中存在预测与解释不一致的问题，这会影响人机交互的可信度和可靠性。需要确保情感解释与预测标签的一致性。

Method: 提出情感理由验证器(ERV)和解释奖励方法，在不改变模型架构或需要额外视频描述标注的情况下，引导模型生成与目标情感一致的解释。

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了忠实解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使MLLMs能够提供情感一致、可信的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to
unprecedented computational demands, raising significant environmental and
ethical concerns. This paper critiques the prevailing reliance on large-scale,
static datasets and monolithic training paradigms, advocating for a shift

contextually while minimizing carbon footprints and human annotation costs. Our
approach addresses pressing challenges in active learning, continual
adaptation, and energy-efficient model deployment, offering a pathway toward
responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有系统关系推理基准过于简化，假设推理可简化为关系路径组合，导致模型难以泛化到其他场景。

Method: 引入NoRA基准，增加多个难度级别，要求模型超越基于路径的推理方法。

Result: 新基准为系统关系推理研究提供了更具挑战性的测试平台。

Conclusion: NoRA基准将推动神经网络在系统关系推理领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Result: JanusCoder系列模型在文本和视觉编码任务上表现优异，7B到14B规模的模型接近甚至超过商业模型性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为协调程序逻辑与其视觉表达提供了关键见解，代码和检查点已开源。

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Motivation: 随着人机协作在工业5.0等范式中变得重要，需要机器安全有效地解释复杂人类行为。当前技术中心化机器人框架缺乏人类行为细微模型，而描述性行为本体不适合实时协作解释。

Method: 基于认知科学和模块化工程方法，开发OntoPret本体，提供形式化、机器可处理的框架来分类行为，包括任务偏差和欺骗行为。

Result: 在制造业和游戏两个不同用例中展示了OntoPret的适应性，并建立了对高级人类意图推理所需的语义基础。

Conclusion: OntoPret填补了技术中心化机器人框架与描述性行为本体之间的研究空白，为人机协作中的实时行为解释提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode提出了一种递归代码生成范式，通过将规划和行动统一在单一代码表示中，解决了LLM智能体无法灵活控制决策粒度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务需要在不同粒度上做出决策，人类能够利用统一的认知表示来实现这一点，但现有的LLM智能体缺乏这种跨粒度操作的关键能力，因为现有范式强制将高层规划与低层行动分离。

Method: ReCode将高层计划视为抽象占位符函数，然后智能体递归地将其分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始行动。这种递归方法消除了规划与行动之间的刚性边界。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有效方法。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人机协作的需求增加，并加剧了社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究公众对AI的态度变化，特别是在ChatGPT发布前后，以了解GenAI技术普及对公众认知的影响。

Method: 使用两波大规模调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），代表瑞士人口，比较ChatGPT发布前后的公众态度。

Result: GenAI热潮与公众AI接受度显著下降相关，完全不可接受AI的比例从23%升至30%，支持纯人类决策的比例从18%升至26%。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展需与公众偏好保持一致的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖人工标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。自博弈RL方法需要特定环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域

Method: 使用单一LLM实例化三个交互代理：提议者生成问题，求解者尝试解答，评判者评估并共同进化。应用强化学习优化行为

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上实验，在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%

Conclusion: MAE是增强LLM通用推理能力的高效方法，对人工监督依赖最小，具有良好的可扩展性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Motivation: 当前的自进化智能体主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的方法来将通用智能体转化为领域专家。

Method: 通过执行领域任务并从中合成候选MCP工具，将其抽象为参数化原语并整合到MCP Box中，在推理时进行检索增强的MCP选择。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3，建立了新的最先进结果，同时将每个示例的平均token数减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的原理性路径，提高了复杂推理任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一个量化动态结构模型中参数对分布假设敏感性的框架，通过扰动参考分布来获得参数边界，并应用于汽车需求和劳动力供给模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态结构模型中序列相关潜变量的分布假设对参数估计至关重要，需要量化这些假设对关键参数（如福利、弹性）的影响。

Method: 通过扰动参考分布并施加平稳性或马尔可夫条件，构建优化问题来推导参数边界，提出计算可行的对偶公式。

Result: 在汽车需求应用中，扰动价格弹性最多偏离15.24%，电动汽车补贴的消费者剩余估计变化达102.75%；在劳动力供给应用中，Frisch劳动供给弹性最多偏离76.83%（工作日）和42.84%（周末）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化动态结构模型对分布假设的敏感性，实证结果显示关键参数可能对分布假设高度敏感。

Abstract: Distributional assumptions that discipline serially correlated latent
variables play a central role in dynamic structural models. We propose a
framework to quantify the sensitivity of scalar parameters of interest (e.g.,
welfare, elasticity) to such distributional assumptions. We derive bounds on
the scalar parameter by perturbing a reference distribution, while imposing a
stationarity condition for time-homogeneous models or a Markovian condition for
time-inhomogeneous models. The bounds are the solutions to optimization
problems, for which we derive a computationally tractable dual formulation. We
establish consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic distribution for the
estimator of the bounds. We demonstrate the approach with two applications: an
infinite-horizon dynamic demand model for new cars in the United Kingdom,
Germany, and France, and a finite-horizon dynamic labor supply model for taxi
drivers in New York City. In the car application, perturbed price elasticities
deviate by at most 15.24% from the reference elasticities, while perturbed
estimates of consumer surplus from an additional $3,000 electric vehicle
subsidy vary by up to 102.75%. In the labor supply application, the perturbed
Frisch labor supply elasticity deviates by at most 76.83% for weekday drivers
and 42.84% for weekend drivers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要对变量间的空间联系施加先验结构，而本文旨在让数据自身揭示空间依赖关系，无需预设空间权重矩阵的结构。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法估计面板空间自回归模型，包含已知数量的潜在共同因子，通过数据驱动方式自动识别空间权重矩阵。

Result: 蒙特卡洛研究表明该方法计算速度极快，估计的空间权重矩阵和共同因子与真实值高度相似。应用于欧盟地区总增加值增长率的实证分析显示存在明显的国家层面集群，且只有小部分数据变异由与解释变量不相关的潜在冲击解释。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别面板数据中的空间依赖结构，为分析区域经济相互依存关系提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We develop a new Bayesian approach to estimating panel spatial autoregressive
models with a known number of latent common factors, where N, the number of
cross-sectional units, is much larger than T, the number of time periods.
Without imposing any a priori structures on the spatial linkages between
variables, we let the data speak for themselves. Extensive Monte Carlo studies
show that our method is super-fast and our estimated spatial weights matrices
and common factors strongly resemble their true counterparts. As an
illustration, we examine the spatial interdependence of regional gross value
added (GVA) growth rates across the European Union (EU). In addition to
revealing the clear presence of predominant country-level clusters, our results
indicate that only a small portion of the variation in the data is explained by
the latent shocks that are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables.

Motivation: 大气扩散理论在理想假设下预测污染指数衰减，但这些假设在实践中常被违反，需要更灵活的方法来准确估计空间边界。

Method: 建立弱平滑性和单调性条件下的非参数识别，提出基于核的估计器与数据驱动带宽选择，推导渐近理论进行推断。

Result: 非参数方法在10公里处减少2.8个百分点误差，100公里处减少3.7个百分点；参数方法系统性地低估近源浓度而高估长距离衰减；COVID-19自然实验验证了时间敏感性。

Conclusion: 灵活的数据驱动空间方法在环境政策应用中显著优于限制性参数假设。

Abstract: This paper develops a nonparametric framework for identifying and estimating
spatial boundaries of treatment effects in settings with geographic spillovers.
While atmospheric dispersion theory predicts exponential decay of pollution
under idealized assumptions, these assumptions -- steady winds, homogeneous
atmospheres, flat terrain -- are systematically violated in practice. I
establish nonparametric identification of spatial boundaries under weak
smoothness and monotonicity conditions, propose a kernel-based estimator with
data-driven bandwidth selection, and derive asymptotic theory for inference.
Using 42 million satellite observations of NO$_2$ concentrations near coal
plants (2019-2021), I find that nonparametric kernel regression reduces
prediction errors by 1.0 percentage point on average compared to parametric
exponential decay assumptions, with largest improvements at policy-relevant
distances: 2.8 percentage points at 10 km (near-source impacts) and 3.7
percentage points at 100 km (long-range transport). Parametric methods
systematically underestimate near-source concentrations while overestimating
long-range decay. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural experiment
validating the framework's temporal sensitivity: NO$_2$ concentrations dropped
4.6\% in 2020, then recovered 5.7\% in 2021. These results demonstrate that
flexible, data-driven spatial methods substantially outperform restrictive
parametric assumptions in environmental policy applications.

Motivation: 虽然面板数据中的分组模式研究已受到广泛关注，但关于如何检验这些模式存在的方法却很少。本文旨在填补这一空白，利用现有的斜率同质性检验工具来检测分组模式。

Method: 采用现有的面板数据斜率同质性检验框架，在双重局部备择假设序列下进行分析，其中斜率被分为主导组和剩余组，剩余组规模和斜率差异随着样本量增加以特定速率缩小。

Result: 蒙特卡洛研究证实了理论发现，验证了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有的斜率同质性检验工具可以有效地用于检测面板数据中的分组模式，但需要注意其在不同条件下的优势和局限性。

Abstract: While the literature on grouped patterns in panel data analysis has received
significant attention, little to no results are available on testing for their
presence. We propose using existing tools for testing slope homogeneity in
panels for this purpose. We highlight the key advantages and limitations of the
available testing frameworks under a sequence of doubly local alternatives,
where slopes are divided into dominant and remainder groups, with the size of
the remainder groups and the slopes differences shrinking at a certain rate as
the sample size increases. A Monte Carlo study corroborate our theoretical
findings.

### [207] [Nonparametric Identification of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from Bank Branch Consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13148)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发非参数框架识别处理效应的空间边界，无需参数函数形式限制。应用于银行分行开业和生存分析，发现贷款申请量随距离衰减但审批率不变，以及高收入地区分行关闭更多的反直觉模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数方法可能强加虚假的空间模式，需要灵活的非参数方法来检测复杂的空间模式，挑战关于银行荒漠的简单化叙述。

Method: 使用数据驱动带宽选择的局部线性回归，灵活估计空间衰减模式并检测处理效应边界。通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证方法性能。

Result: 分行邻近显著影响贷款申请量（每10英里下降8.5%）但不影响审批率；高收入地区经历更多分行关闭，这反映了在过度银行化的富裕城市区域战略整合冗余分行。

Conclusion: 灵活的非参数方法对于检测参数模型会遗漏的复杂空间模式是必要的，揭示了空间整合决策背后的组织复杂性，挑战了关于银行荒漠的简单化叙述。

Abstract: I develop a nonparametric framework for identifying spatial boundaries of
treatment effects without imposing parametric functional form restrictions. The
method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to
flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect
boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach
exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when
none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial
patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020,
matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209
census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects
loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates,
consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit
decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital
transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area
income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom.
This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant
branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against
poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and
competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch
density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings
demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting
complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge
simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational
complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.

*Federico Crippa*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了Tukey模型来研究双边互动中的互补性，建立了互动函数灵活性与匹配网络密度之间的识别权衡，开发了基于循环的估计方法，并提供了互补性检验的实证应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双边互动模型，其中结果取决于两种不同类型代理的潜在特征，重点关注互补性在互动中的作用。

Method: 引入Tukey模型捕捉互补性，提出基于循环的估计方法，构建互补性检验，并进行实证说明。

Result: Tukey模型在温和条件下可识别，而更灵活的扩展需要密集网络；提出的估计器在稀疏网络下仍具有一致性和渐近正态性；实证显示模型能恢复经济上有意义的互补性。

Conclusion: Tukey模型为研究双边互动中的互补性提供了实用的识别和估计框架，即使在稀疏网络条件下也能有效工作。

Abstract: This paper studies a class of models for two-sided interactions, where
outcomes depend on latent characteristics of two distinct agent types. Models
in this class have two core elements: the matching network, which records which
agent pairs interact, and the interaction function, which maps latent
characteristics of these agents to outcomes and determines the role of
complementarities. I introduce the Tukey model, which captures
complementarities with a single interaction parameter, along with two
extensions that allow richer complementarity patterns. First, I establish an
identification trade-off between the flexibility of the interaction function
and the density of the matching network: the Tukey model is identified under
mild conditions, whereas the more flexible extensions require dense networks
that are rarely observed in applications. Second, I propose a cycle-based
estimator for the Tukey interaction parameter and show that it is consistent
and asymptotically normal even when the network is sparse. Third, I use its
asymptotic distribution to construct a formal test of no complementarities.
Finally, an empirical illustration shows that the Tukey model recovers
economically meaningful complementarities.

### [209] [Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: A Continuous Functional Framework from Navier-Stokes Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14409)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程的动态空间处理效应边界理论框架，将处理强度定义为时空连续函数，建立了处理效应的标度律，并通过卫星观测数据验证了方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散处理效应估计方法无法充分捕捉空间处理效应的传播动态和边界演化，需要建立连续函数框架来统一分析处理效应的传播机制和累积暴露模式。

Method: 基于Navier-Stokes偏微分方程建立连续函数框架，利用Kummer合流超几何函数和修正贝塞尔函数的精确自相似解，建立处理效应的标度律τ(d,t)=t^(-α)f(d/t^β)，并通过4200万TROPOMI卫星观测数据和蒙特卡洛模拟进行验证。

Result: 实证验证显示NO2污染呈现强指数空间衰减(κs=0.004/km，R²=0.35)，可检测边界达572km。蒙特卡洛模拟表明在边界检测和假阳性避免方面优于离散参数方法(94% vs 27%正确拒绝)。区域异质性分析验证了诊断能力。

Conclusion: 连续函数视角统一了空间计量经济学与数学物理，为环境经济学、银行和医疗等领域的边界检测、暴露量化和政策评估提供了理论基础方法。

Abstract: I develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for dynamic spatial treatment
effect boundaries using continuous functional definitions grounded in
Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment
effect estimators, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as a
continuous function $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous
analysis of propagation dynamics, boundary evolution, and cumulative exposure
patterns. Building on exact self-similar solutions expressible through Kummer
confluent hypergeometric and modified Bessel functions, I establish that
treatment effects follow scaling laws $\tau(d, t) = t^{-\alpha} f(d/t^\beta)$
where exponents characterize diffusion mechanisms. Empirical validation using
42 million TROPOMI satellite observations of NO$_2$ pollution from U.S.
coal-fired power plants demonstrates strong exponential spatial decay
($\kappa_s = 0.004$ per km, $R^2 = 0.35$) with detectable boundaries at 572 km.
Monte Carlo simulations confirm superior performance over discrete parametric
methods in boundary detection and false positive avoidance (94\% vs 27\%
correct rejection). Regional heterogeneity analysis validates diagnostic
capability: positive decay parameters within 100 km confirm coal plant
dominance; negative parameters beyond 100 km correctly signal when urban
sources dominate. The continuous functional perspective unifies spatial
econometrics with mathematical physics, providing theoretically grounded
methods for boundary detection, exposure quantification, and policy evaluation
across environmental economics, banking, and healthcare applications.

*Shovon Sengupta,Sunny Kumar Singh,Tanujit Chakraborty*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展的Sims Zha贝叶斯VAR模型(SZBVARx)，通过整合领域知识驱动的收缩方法和四种基于新闻的不确定性冲击，改进了宏观经济预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAR模型在高维环境下容易过拟合，而阈值VAR难以处理时变依赖关系和复杂参数结构。面对地缘政治动荡、政策反转和金融市场波动，需要更稳健的预测方法。

Method: 扩展SZBVAR模型，加入外生变量和四种不确定性冲击（经济政策不确定性、地缘政治风险、美国股市波动性、美国货币政策不确定性），结合小波相干分析和非线性局部投影方法。

Result: 在12个月和24个月预测期内，SZBVARx在G7数据上优于14个基准模型，包括传统VAR和领先的机器学习模型，并通过多种统计测试验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SZBVARx为G7政策制定者提供了一个透明、校准良好的工具，用于在普遍不确定性环境下进行现代宏观经济预测和风险管理。

Abstract: Accurate macroeconomic forecasting has become harder amid geopolitical
disruptions, policy reversals, and volatile financial markets. Conventional
vector autoregressions (VARs) overfit in high dimensional settings, while
threshold VARs struggle with time varying interdependencies and complex
parameter structures. We address these limitations by extending the Sims Zha
Bayesian VAR with exogenous variables (SZBVARx) to incorporate domain-informed
shrinkage and four newspaper based uncertainty shocks such as economic policy
uncertainty, geopolitical risk, US equity market volatility, and US monetary
policy uncertainty. The framework improves structural interpretability,
mitigates dimensionality, and imposes empirically guided regularization. Using
G7 data, we study spillovers from uncertainty shocks to five core variables
(unemployment, real broad effective exchange rates, short term rates, oil
prices, and CPI inflation), combining wavelet coherence (time frequency
dynamics) with nonlinear local projections (state dependent impulse responses).
Out-of-sample results at 12 and 24 month horizons show that SZBVARx outperforms
14 benchmarks, including classical VARs and leading machine learning models, as
confirmed by Murphy difference diagrams, multivariate Diebold Mariano tests,
and Giacomini White predictability tests. Credible Bayesian prediction
intervals deliver robust uncertainty quantification for scenario analysis and
risk management. The proposed SZBVARx offers G7 policymakers a transparent,
well calibrated tool for modern macroeconomic forecasting under pervasive
uncertainty.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了基于纳维-斯托克斯偏微分方程的连续函数框架来分析空间处理效应，将处理强度建模为时空连续函数，能够分析边界演化、空间梯度和累积暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散处理参数方法无法充分捕捉空间效应的连续性和动态演化，需要开发能够分析边界演变和空间梯度的连续框架。

Method: 使用纳维-斯托克斯偏微分方程构建连续函数框架，将处理强度建模为时空连续函数τ(x,t)，通过32,520个美国邮政编码数据进行实证验证。

Result: 医疗可及性呈现指数空间衰减(κ=0.002837/km)，检测到37.1km边界；模型选择强烈支持对数衰减而非指数衰减(ΔAIC>10,000)；老年人群距离效应强2-13倍；教育梯度显著。

Conclusion: 连续函数框架提供了传统双重差分方法不具备的预测能力(d*(t)=ξ*√t)、参数敏感性和诊断测试，可应用于环境经济学、银行和医疗政策等领域。

Abstract: I develop a continuous functional framework for spatial treatment effects
grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete
treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as
continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous
analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure.
Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential
spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 =
0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully
diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate
diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly
signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$
stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education
gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential
($\Delta \text{AIC} > 10,000$), representing a middle ground between
exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics,
banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides
predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity
($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional
difference-in-differences approaches.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的实验设计框架，用于在需要结合实验和观察证据来估计更广泛政策效应（如外部有效性和一般均衡效应）时，优化实验参数选择、样本分配和估计器权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当实验估计不足以推断更广泛政策问题时，研究者需要结合实验和观察证据，但观察证据可能存在未知偏差，需要系统的方法来权衡偏差和方差。

Method: 开发了一个极小化最大比例遗憾目标，评估候选设计相对于知道偏差的预言机，产生透明的偏差-方差权衡，不需要预设偏差界限，仅依赖于估计器精度和估计量对参数的敏感性信息。

Result: 框架通过两个应用案例展示：(i) 设计小规模现金转移实验来估计一般均衡效应；(ii) 优化小额信贷干预的地点选择。

Conclusion: 该框架为在需要结合实验和观察证据的复杂政策评估场景中，提供了系统化的实验设计方法，能够有效处理观察证据的潜在偏差问题。

Abstract: Experiments deliver credible but often localized effects, tied to specific
sites, populations, or mechanisms. When such estimates are insufficient to
extrapolate effects for broader policy questions, such as external validity and
general-equilibrium (GE) effects, researchers combine trials with external
evidence from reduced-form or structural observational estimates, or prior
experiments. We develop a unified framework for designing experiments in this
setting: the researcher selects which parameters to identify experimentally
from a feasible set (which treatment arms and/or individuals to include in the
experiment), allocates sample size, and specifies how to weight experimental
and observational estimators. Because observational inputs may be biased in
ways unknown ex ante, we develop a minimax proportional regret objective that
evaluates any candidate design relative to an oracle that knows the bias and
jointly chooses the design and estimator. This yields a transparent
bias-variance trade-off that requires no prespecified bias bound and depends
only on information about the precision of the estimators and the estimand's
sensitivity to the underlying parameters. We illustrate the framework by (i)
designing small-scale cash transfer experiments aimed at estimating GE effects
and (ii) optimizing site selection for microfinance interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果效应或结构模型中，感兴趣的参数依赖于回归函数。使用机器学习方法估计的回归函数直接代入识别方程可能因一阶段偏差而导致性能不佳。

Method: 开发了直接去偏机器学习框架，通过最小化已知和未知nuisance参数计算的Neyman正交得分之间的差异来估计nuisance参数（回归函数和Riesz表示器），使用Bregman散度衡量差异。

Result: 该框架统一了多种方法：平方损失产生Riesz回归，KL散度产生熵平衡，特定情况下自动获得协变量平衡性质。

Conclusion: 提出的直接去偏机器学习框架提供了一个统一的端到端算法，能够有效减少一阶段偏差，并在特定情况下自动实现协变量平衡。

Abstract: We develop a direct debiased machine learning framework comprising Neyman
targeted estimation and generalized Riesz regression. Our framework unifies
Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing,
targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. In
many problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters of
interest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functions
estimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yield
poor performance because of first-stage bias. To reduce such bias, debiased
machine learning employs Neyman orthogonal estimating equations. Debiased
machine learning typically requires estimation of the Riesz representer and the
regression function. For this problem, we develop a direct debiased machine
learning framework with an end-to-end algorithm. We formulate estimation of the
nuisance parameters, the regression function and the Riesz representer, as
minimizing the discrepancy between Neyman orthogonal scores computed with known
and unknown nuisance parameters, which we refer to as Neyman targeted
estimation. Neyman targeted estimation includes Riesz representer estimation,
and we measure discrepancies using the Bregman divergence. The Bregman
divergence encompasses various loss functions as special cases, where the
squared loss yields Riesz regression and the Kullback-Leibler divergence yields
entropy balancing. We refer to this Riesz representer estimation as generalized
Riesz regression. Neyman targeted estimation also yields TMLE as a special case
for regression function estimation. Furthermore, for specific pairs of models
and Riesz representer estimation methods, we can automatically obtain the
covariate balancing property without explicitly solving the covariate balancing
objective.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了面板向量自回归(PVAR)的同期因果解释，指出解释取决于原因变量的分布，可从平均处理效应到平均因果响应。在无残差自相关假设下，PVAR可识别处理组的平均处理效应，特别适用于稀疏处理情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中的方法如交错DiD或LP-DiD在假设条件上存在局限，PVAR方法通过在残差而非结果变量上设定假设，为评估干预对结果变量创新成分的影响提供了新工具。

Method: 基于面板向量自回归框架，引入无残差自相关假设，将某些单位视为控制组，从而识别处理组的平均处理效应。该方法特别适用于稀疏处理情况。

Result: 通过美国每周频率的自然灾害对经济活动影响的实证分析，验证了该方法的有效性，能够捕捉干预对结果变量创新成分的影响。

Conclusion: PVAR方法为因果推断提供了新的视角，但需要关注SUTVA假设可能因干扰而违反的问题，并讨论了相应的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper discusses the different contemporaneous causal interpretations of
Panel Vector Autoregressions (PVAR). I show that the interpretation of PVARs
depends on the distribution of the causing variable, and can range from average
treatment effects, to average causal responses, to a combination of the two. If
the researcher is willing to postulate a no residual autocorrelation
assumption, and some units can be thought of as controls, PVAR can identify
average treatment effects on the treated. This method complements the toolkits
already present in the literature, such as staggered-DiD, or LP-DiD, as it
formulates assumptions in the residuals, and not in the outcome variables. Such
a method features a notable advantage: it allows units to be ``sparsely''
treated, capturing the impact of interventions on the innovation component of
the outcome variables. I provide an example related to the evaluation of the
effects of natural disasters economic activity at the weekly frequency in the
US.I conclude by discussing solutions to potential violations of the SUTVA
assumption arising from interference.

Motivation: 传统监控方法无法弥合技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性之间的差距，即时支付系统需要处理数百万交易且要求零停机。

Method: 基于连续ISO 20022消息交换的处理时间计算特征工程，创建系统状态的紧凑表示，并应用异常检测技术。

Result: 在TARGET即时支付结算系统上的实验评估表明，该方法能有效检测多种异常模式，提供可解释的解释，显著减少调查时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将特征映射到不同的处理阶段，区分内部和外部支付系统问题，弥合了分布式系统中交易状态分散的观测性差距。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

<details>

Motivation: 低精度训练的Transformer会出现前向误差放大问题，需要理论分析来预测误差增长的位置和时机，并提供可操作的诊断工具。

Method: 开发了模块化的一阶理论，为自注意力机制推导出包含三个诊断指标的逐层误差边界，并引入精度和宽度感知的LayerNorm指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪不同精度间的误差失配，时间序列最大软敏感度可作为早期预警信号，基于LayerNorm指标的微调能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的无量纲诊断工具，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)方法，通过直接优化层谱来改善神经网络训练条件，显著降低条件数并提升测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中因条件数过大导致的优化不稳定和性能下降问题，实现优化驱动的谱预处理。

Method: 使用Chebyshev矩正则化损失函数，联合控制谱边界（通过对数条件代理）和内部形状（通过Chebyshev矩），采用解耦的带帽混合规则来保持任务梯度。

Result: 在对抗性κ-应力设置中，相比普通训练，CMR在5个epoch内将平均层条件数降低了约10^3倍（从约3.9×10^3降至约3.4），增加了平均梯度幅度，并将测试精度从约10%恢复到约86%。

Conclusion: CMR证明了直接引导模型朝向良好条件区域的可行性，为稳定、准确的学习提供了有效的谱预处理方法。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，发现阿片类药物剂量和手术部位是重要影响因素，存在性别差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误吸显著影响手术患者发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以便及时采取预防措施

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826名术后误吸患者，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种机器学习模型，并采用增强逆概率加权进行因果分析

Result: 模型AUROC达0.86，敏感度77.3%。最大日阿片剂量、住院时间和患者年龄是最重要预测因子。男性误吸风险是女性的1.5倍，且阿片剂量高出27%

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测术后误吸风险，阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响风险，性别差异需要进一步研究

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

*Shifeng Xu,Yanzhu Liu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种统计测量预测误差的方法和方差减少引导（VRG）技术，通过搜索新的采样轨迹来减少扩散模型中的预测误差积累，提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差，这些误差会随着采样步骤累积并降低生成质量，需要一种无需模型微调或修改的方法来缓解这个问题。

Method: 提出VRG方法，统计测量预测误差，在预定义采样轨迹的基础上搜索具有相同步数但质量更高的新轨迹，适用于条件和非条件生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提高扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的技术，能够减少扩散模型采样过程中的预测误差积累，提升生成结果的质量，且无需修改模型架构或进行微调。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

TL;DR: 提出PCC-MJO深度学习框架作为通用后处理器，可将MJO预报技巧期延长2-8天，有效缓解"海洋大陆障碍"问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球极端天气气候的重要驱动因子，但业务动力模式的预报技巧通常仅限于3-4周，需要改进预报能力

Method: 两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后使用针对预报技巧优化的LSTM细化MJO的RMM指数

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个业务预报时，统一框架将技巧预报范围（双变量相关>0.5）一致延长2-8天，有效缓解海洋大陆障碍

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，突破次季节预报中长期存在的障碍

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

TL;DR: MARS-M是一种结合了矩阵预条件优化器Muon和方差缩减技术MARS的新优化器，在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中表现优于Muon，收敛速度从$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$提升到$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）在LLM预训练中能显著加速。为了结合两者的优势，开发了MARS-M优化器。

Method: 将MARS中的方差缩减技术与Muon优化器集成，创建新的MARS-M优化器。

Result: 在标准正则条件下，MARS-M以$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$的速率收敛到一阶驻点，优于Muon的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$速率。在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M始终产生更低的损失并在各种下游基准测试中表现更好。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预条件和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实证上都表现出优于Muon的性能，为大规模神经网络训练提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

Result: 实现了首个稳定、加速的超过10,000时间步的模拟，在未见边界条件下鲁棒泛化，并扩展到3D流动。速度提升达4.98倍，热场相对误差约1E-3，低幅速度动态误差低于1E-2 ms-1。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场雾短期预测中机器学习模型依赖地理位置特定特征、难以跨站点迁移的问题，探索通过编码基本热力学和辐射过程来实现地理可迁移性。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)，基于圣地亚哥(SCEL)2002-2009年数据训练，采用无坐标(位置无关)特征集，在2010-2012年保留集和三个不同机场进行严格的零样本测试。

Result: 模型在相距11650公里的不同机场(智利、美国、英国)和不同雾类型(辐射雾、平流雾、海雾)上都取得了0.923-0.947的AUC值，表现出良好的地理迁移能力。

Conclusion: 基于物理信息的无坐标特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预报工具，模型学习到了可迁移的物理关系而非站点特定模式。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

Motivation: 高维数据集的激增需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型，传统深度学习方法缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策敏感应用中的部署。

Method: 使用分层注意力机制、降维技术和解释驱动损失函数，通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，通过原型表示提供全局模型解释。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上达到94.3%的分类准确率，超越了SHAP和LIME等传统后处理可解释方法，有效识别了生物学相关的癌症生物标志物。

Conclusion: HAIN通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，推进了精准医学和监管合规透明AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据对象，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘领域的长期挑战。本文旨在研究新提出的多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)相对于广泛使用的动态时间规整(DTW)的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用MDD和DTW两种方法进行对比分析，MDD通过多尺度时间序列相似性评估并避免点对点对齐。通过模拟实验和UCR档案中的95个数据集测试假设，并将两种方法应用于实际分类任务。

Result: 在许多场景下，MDD显著优于DTW，性能提升明显。通过详细分析MDD解决的具体性能差距，并在实际分类任务中验证了MDD相比DTW的显著改进。

Conclusion: MDD在多尺度时间序列相似性度量方面具有明显优势，避免了DTW的点对点对齐限制，在实际应用中展现出更好的实用价值。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布常常偏斜且存在不可预测的异常值，导致GRPO等基于组相对方法在优势计算时出现失真和噪声增加。

Method: GAPO为每个提示自适应寻找无异常值的最高密度区间，使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值进行优势计算，保持即插即用和高效率。

Result: 在9个指令调优LLM（3B-14B）和包含51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务的大规模数据集上验证，相比GRPO及其变体DAPO在精确匹配准确率上取得一致提升。

Conclusion: GAPO能够鲁棒处理偏斜分布，在代码编辑的强化学习后训练中表现优于现有方法，且代码已公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法为密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致性能恢复不理想。剪枝引起的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性恢复这些信息可以显著提升模型性能。

Method: RestoreLCC通过对比激活编辑探测关键注意力头，从激活差异中提取丢失组件，并将其注入剪枝后的头部进行补偿。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面均优于现有最优基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的方法，能有效恢复剪枝LLM的性能，同时保持其低成本和高效率特性。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优越，尽管在ROUGE-L得分上比直接视觉到语言模型低3.5%。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

TL;DR: 提出GP-MIA，一种基于高斯过程元建模的高效可解释成员推理攻击方法，无需影子模型或大量查询，仅使用训练后指标即可区分训练集成员与非成员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法通常依赖影子模型或大量查询访问，实用性受限，存在严重的隐私风险。

Method: 使用单个训练模型的训练后指标（准确率、熵、数据集统计量）和可选敏感特征（梯度、NTK度量），训练高斯过程分类器来区分成员与非成员，并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成数据、真实世界欺诈检测数据、CIFAR-10和WikiText-2上的实验表明，GP-MIA实现了高准确率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GP-MIA为现有成员推理攻击提供了实用的替代方案，具有高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

TL;DR: 本文首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报，提出SynCast方法，采用两阶段训练框架解决确定性模型过度平滑和概率模型性能波动的问题，在冲突指标间实现协同改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型过度平滑难以捕捉极端事件、概率模型性能波动、以及多个评估指标之间存在冲突（如CSI和FAR的权衡）等挑战。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用Diffusion-SPO两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段专注于降低FAR，训练模型抑制误报；第二阶段在保持FAR对齐的基础上进一步优化CSI。

Result: 该方法能够渐进对齐冲突指标，在多个评估指标上实现一致的优越性能。

Conclusion: 偏好优化能够有效解决降水临近预报中多个冲突指标间的权衡问题，实现协同改进。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

TL;DR: TowerVision是一个基于多语言文本模型Tower+构建的多语言视觉语言模型家族，在图像-文本和视频-文本任务上表现出色，特别是在文化相关任务和多模态翻译方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型大多以英语为中心设计，限制了其在多语言环境中的有效性，需要开发专门的多语言视觉语言模型。

Method: 通过分析多语言设计选择（如训练数据组成、编码器选择和文本骨干网络），基于Tower+多语言文本模型构建TowerVision模型，并发布VisionBlocks高质量视觉语言数据集。

Result: TowerVision在多个多模态多语言基准测试中取得竞争性性能，在ALM-Bench、Multi30K和ViMUL-Bench上超越了基于更大数据集训练的现有方法。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的大语言模型并非总是最佳初始化选择。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Motivation: 传统DEIM方法在投影基降阶模型中虽然能有效近似非线性项，但其固定的插值点限制了在复杂时变动力系统中的适应性。

Method: 开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，允许神经网络动态选择插值点；并将DEIM作为可解释分析工具，用于检查预训练NODE模型在二维涡旋合并问题中学到的动力学。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可以作为模型降阶工具，还可以作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经网络微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在无外部反馈情况下进行递归自我评估时，是否真的能实现有效的反思性推理，还是仅仅停留在表面上的重新表述。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用三个模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在四种任务类型上进行十次迭代，比较无基础自我批判和最小基础干预两种条件。

Result: 无基础运行的均值信息变化从早期迭代的0.193下降到后期迭代的0.087（下降55%），而有基础干预的运行在干预后信息变化反弹28%并保持非零方差。

Conclusion: 生成式推理中的自我修正存在结构性限制，没有与独立验证者或环境的信息交换，递归推理会趋向认知停滞状态。最小基础干预作为耗散耦合，能重新引入信息流动。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Motivation: 旨在为具有基础深度学习知识的读者提供扩散模型的概念性和数学基础理解，追溯其起源并展示不同表述如何从共同数学思想中产生。

Method: 扩散模型通过定义前向过程逐步将数据破坏为噪声，学习反向过程将噪声转换回数据。采用三种互补视角：变分视角（逐步去噪）、基于分数的视角（学习数据分布梯度）、基于流的视角（学习速度场）。

Result: 建立了扩散模型的统一数学框架，表明不同视角共享共同骨干：时间依赖的速度场，其流动将简单先验传输到数据分布。采样相当于求解将噪声演化为数据的微分方程。

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一个强大的生成建模框架，通过连续轨迹将噪声转换为数据，为可控生成、高效采样和直接映射学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Conclusion: 该框架支持符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改等治理约束，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的线性注意力前向和后向传播方法，配合高度优化的CUDA实现，速度比现有最佳方法快3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的常规注意力机制时间复杂度为O(N²D)，线性注意力虽然理论上有O(ND²)的线性复杂度，但实际效率落后于理论。

Method: 开发了新的线性注意力前向和后向传播算法，并实现了高度优化的CUDA实现。

Result: 在单层和端到端设置中验证了改进，训练了14亿参数的语言模型，在主要推理基准测试中表现出与常规注意力相似的表达能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了线性注意力的实际效率，使其在保持表达能力的同时达到理论上的线性复杂度优势。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除低置信度token来解决并行采样中的条件独立性和高置信度预测之间的冲突，在保持准确性的同时实现更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型(MDMs)相比自回归模型(ARMs)可以实现并行token采样，从而获得更快的推理速度。但并行采样面临两个冲突需求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，而更新应优先考虑高置信度预测，但高置信度预测往往相互依赖。

Method: PUNT通过识别token依赖关系，从冲突组中移除低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集，通过近似条件独立性测试确保改进的并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT相比基线方法(包括顺序生成)实现了高达16%的准确率提升，尤其在生成长序列时表现优异，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出分层生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，表现出类似规划的生成过程，有助于强对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP) 是一种用于高维分段连续函数代理建模的新方法，通过在跳跃高斯过程中添加局部线性投影层来克服传统方法在高维输入空间中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跳跃高斯过程在高维输入空间中存在局限性，需要一种能够捕捉局部子空间结构并处理分段连续关系的方法。

Method: DJGP 在跳跃高斯过程中添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，并在投影矩阵上放置高斯过程先验以控制模型复杂度。投影后的输入通过跳跃高斯过程建模分段连续关系。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP 相比现有方法具有更优的预测准确性和更可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: DJGP 通过结合局部线性投影和跳跃高斯过程，有效解决了高维分段连续函数的建模问题，提供了优越的预测性能和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: RLVR训练会导致模型能力退化，作者提出RECAP方法通过动态目标重加权来保护通用知识，在保持推理能力的同时防止基础技能遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练虽然提升了数学和多模态推理能力，但会导致模型在感知和忠实性等基础能力上的性能下降，现有正则化方法无法保证广泛知识的保留。

Method: 提出RECAP方法，使用动态目标重加权机制，基于收敛和不稳定性信号在线调整训练焦点，从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B和7B模型上的实验表明，该方法有效保护了通用能力，同时通过更灵活的任务奖励权衡提升了推理能力。

Conclusion: RECAP是一种端到端的重放策略，无需额外模型或大量调参即可应用于现有RLVR流程，有效解决了能力退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法通常使用单一的最小自由能结构来表示分子，但这种方法无法充分反映热力学平衡下的低能构象集合。实验偏差（如PCR扩增或测序噪声）会掩盖真实的适配体-配体亲和力。

Method: 引入热力学参数化的指数族随机图嵌入，将分子建模为玻尔兹曼加权的相互作用图集合，而不是单一图结构。

Result: 该方法在SELEX数据集上实现了稳健的群落检测，并能提供子图级解释，即使在存在观测偏差的情况下也能识别适配体-配体亲和力。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于识别低丰度的适配体候选物进行进一步实验评估，为存在实验偏差的生物化学数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为只有时序差分方法能够实现经验拼接，但在函数逼近设置中轨迹永不交叉，且蒙特卡洛方法是否具有隐式拼接能力尚不明确。本文旨在实证研究这一传统观点在函数逼近设置下是否成立。

Method: 使用不同容量的神经网络作为价值函数逼近器，比较蒙特卡洛方法和时序差分方法在经验拼接能力上的表现。

Result: 实证证明蒙特卡洛方法也能实现经验拼接。虽然时序差分方法表现略好，但差距远小于小网络与大网络之间的差距。增加批评者容量能有效减少两种方法的泛化差距。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，传统的时序差分归纳偏置对拼接的必要性可能降低，有时甚至收益递减。拼接这种RL特有的泛化形式可能通过规模而非专门算法实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但在实践中，生成文本的重复会导致碰撞和结构化依赖，损害第一类错误控制并使标准分析失效。

Method: 引入统计框架，通过分层两区划捕获结构依赖，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但单元内允许依赖的最小分组。使用最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印，框架产生闭式最优规则。解释了为何丢弃重复统计量通常能提高性能，并表明除非退化，否则必须处理单元内依赖。理论和实验都证实了在严格第一类错误控制下检测能力的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),

sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure

this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest

Conclusion: WA作为与TCC最小化一致的评估指标，为分类器比较和参数优化提供了更合适的标准，同时澄清了类别重平衡技术的适用场景。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Result: 在安全控制任务中，K-DAREK比KAN集成快4倍、计算效率高10倍，比GP可扩展性高8.6倍，比之前的DAREK安全50%。

Conclusion: K-DAREK是一种高效、可解释且具有不确定性量化的函数逼近方法，特别适用于动态系统中的算子估计和系统建模。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence
clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how
different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a
principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly
effective choice.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了线性最优传输（LOT）框架，用于将单细胞技术生成的不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间中，同时保留分布结构，实现了预测性能、可解释性和生成建模的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术生成高维细胞点云，但每个患者由不规则点云而非简单向量表示，难以直接量化和比较个体间的生物学差异。非线性方法如核和神经网络虽能实现预测准确性，但作为黑箱提供很少生物学可解释性。

Method: 采用线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间中，保留最优传输几何结构，形成任何两个患者之间的配准，实现细胞分布的直接比较。

Result: LOT实现了：（i）COVID-19患者状态的准确且可解释分类，分类器权重可映射回驱动预测的特定标记和空间区域；（ii）患者来源类器官的合成数据生成，利用LOT嵌入的线性性，LOT重心产生代表组合条件或样本的平均细胞谱，支持药物相互作用测试。

Conclusion: LOT作为一个统一框架，弥合了预测性能、可解释性和生成建模之间的差距，通过将异质点云转换为可直接追溯到原始数据的结构化嵌入，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Conclusion: OLLA为带约束采样提供高效框架，能同时处理等式和不等式约束，避免投影步骤，具有理论保证和良好实证性能

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Motivation: GNN在图形结构数据学习上具有高精度，但存在高计算和资源成本问题，需要研究神经网络压缩方法来减小模型尺寸同时保持合理精度。

Method: 使用三种剪枝方法和三种量化方法，在三个图数据集(Cora、Proteins、BBBP)上对不同的GNN模型进行实验，包括图分类、节点分类和链接预测任务。

Result: 非结构化细粒度和全局剪枝能显著减小模型尺寸50%，并在微调后保持或提高精度。量化方法在不同数据集上对准确率、推理时间和模型尺寸产生不同影响。

Conclusion: 剪枝和量化是有效的GNN压缩技术，非结构化剪枝在保持性能的同时显著减小模型尺寸，量化效果因数据集而异。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Conclusion: DGPFM方法成功解决了函数空间映射学习中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，为函数数据分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了通用、理论可靠且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow是数据受限领域中生成和分类的有效策略，对隐私保护增强、鲁棒泛化和可信医疗AI具有直接益处。

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real

unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing

  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提升了天气预报准确性，还通过预训练权重大幅降低了训练成本和环境影响，对机器学习可持续发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于动态图神经网络(Dynamic GNN)的数据驱动方法，用于生理药代动力学(PBPK)建模，相比传统ODE方法和基线MLP、LSTM模型，在药物浓度预测方面取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PBPK建模基于常微分方程，具有强烈的简化假设，限制了其对非线性生理相互作用的适应性。需要探索数据驱动的替代方法来提高预测准确性。

Method: 提出了动态图神经网络(Dynamic GNN)，将生理连接建模为器官间的循环消息传递过程。同时实现了多层感知器(MLP)和长短期记忆网络(LSTM)作为基线模型。

Result: Dynamic GNN在所有模型中表现最佳，R²为0.9342，RMSE为0.0159，MAE为0.0116。MLP基线R²为0.8705，LSTM为0.8059。

Conclusion: 明确建模器官相互作用的时空依赖性能够实现更准确和可泛化的药物浓度预测。Dynamic GNN为传统PBPK公式提供了可扩展、无方程的替代方案，在临床前和临床研究中具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

TL;DR: 提出AniDS框架，通过各向异性变分自编码器改进3D分子去噪预训练，解决了现有方法假设原子运动为各向同性和同方差性的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐标去噪方法依赖于过度简化的分子动力学假设，认为原子运动是各向同性和同方差性的，这与实际分子系统的方向性和结构变异性不符。

Method: 引入结构感知的各向异性噪声生成器，能够产生原子特定的全协方差矩阵，这些协方差来自原子间相互作用对各向同性基底的各向异性修正。

Result: 在MD17和OC22基准测试中，AniDS优于先前的各向同性和同方差去噪模型及其他领先方法，在力预测精度上分别实现了8.9%和6.2%的平均相对改进。

Conclusion: AniDS能够自适应地抑制沿键合方向的噪声，与物理化学原理一致，为3D分子预训练提供了更准确的去噪框架。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过隐式梯度手术有效解决了机器遗忘中的效用保持问题，在计算效率和性能权衡方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Motivation: NCO模型虽然性能优异，但其学习到的表示和决策原理仍是一个黑盒，这阻碍了学术研究和实际部署，需要更深入的洞察。

Method: 通过多种探测任务分析NCO模型表示，并引入新的Coefficient Significance Probing(CS-Probing)工具来检查探测过程中的系数和统计显著性。

Result: 发现NCO模型编码了解决方案构建所需的低层信息，同时捕获了促进更好决策的高层知识。CS-Probing揭示了主流NCO模型对其学习表示施加了不同的归纳偏置，发现了与模型泛化相关的直接证据，并识别了与特定知识相关的关键嵌入维度。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了探测作为分析NCO模型内部机制的有前景工具，为NCO社区揭示了重要见解，通过少量代码修改可以改进模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

TL;DR: TN-SHAP使用张量网络替代模型，将Shapley值的O(2^n)联盟枚举复杂度降低为少量评估，实现高效的特征交互分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值和交互指数计算需要枚举所有特征联盟，复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征场景下计算不可行。

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，使联盟量成为系数张量的线性探测。用少量目标评估替代穷举联盟扫描来提取k阶Shapley交互。

Result: 在UCI数据集上，方法在保持精度的同时比KernelSHAP-IQ快25-1000倍，评估次数减少数个数量级。

Conclusion: TN-SHAP为Shapley交互分析提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Result: 数千次顺序编辑实验显示，NMKE在保持高编辑成功率和模型通用能力方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度神经元编辑和动态掩码策略，有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的攻击，现有研究缺乏对能够完全控制模型训练过程的恶意参与者的系统分析。

Method: 提出独裁者客户端概念，设计具体攻击策略，理论分析单/多独裁者客户端在不同协作模式下的影响，并在CV和NLP基准上进行实证评估。

Result: 独裁者客户端能够成功消除其他客户端的贡献，多独裁者场景下的协作、独立行动或背叛行为都会对全局模型收敛产生显著影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习系统需要更强的防御机制来应对独裁者客户端这类能够完全控制训练过程的恶意攻击者。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度D的上界并提供了下界，证明了双Lipschitz失真与n的二次方相关且与d无关，同时给出了失真度的下界Ω(√n)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图表征学习中，需要保证输出对节点排列的不变性。基于排序的嵌入方法β_A虽然已知在足够大的D下是单射且满足双Lipschitz条件，但存在两个关键问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，且缺乏双Lipschitz常数的估计。

Method: 研究排序嵌入β_A: X ↦ ↓(XA)，其中↓表示矩阵的列排序。通过构造特定的矩阵A来分析嵌入的单射性和双Lipschitz性质，并考虑通过线性投影降低输出维度的变体。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界并提供了下界；构造了使β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n二次相关且与d无关的矩阵A；证明了失真度至少为Ω(√n)；对降维变体也得到了类似结果。

Conclusion: 该研究在排序嵌入的两个关键问题上取得了实质性进展：明确了最优嵌入维度的界限，并建立了双Lipschitz失真的精确估计，为图表征学习提供了理论保障。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Result: 通过精确比特计数和率失真分析评估，EPC始终优于预测掩码(PM)基线，在显著更低的比特率下提供更优的保真度，更高效地利用了模型的内在知识。

Conclusion: EPC在有损文本压缩中表现出色，通过利用语言模型的预测能力实现了高效的率失真权衡，为基于语言模型的有损压缩提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

TL;DR: 层剪枝会严重损害大语言模型的测试时扩展能力，即使只剪枝1-2层也会导致长链推理性能急剧下降，而标准微调方法无法恢复这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法在通用知识任务上表现良好，但其对长链推理这种更脆弱但关键能力的影响尚未被充分探索。

Method: 通过测试时扩展的视角研究层剪枝对长链推理的影响，进行大量实验分析剪枝对推理能力的影响机制。

Result: 剪枝即使1-2层也会严重损害测试时扩展能力，在长推理基准上性能急剧下降，而知识密集型任务性能保持稳定。标准微调无法恢复受损的测试时扩展能力。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型LLMs存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略并开发能保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

TL;DR: LUNA是一个自监督的脑电图基础模型，通过将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，解决了电极布局异构性问题，在多个下游任务中表现出色，同时大幅降低了计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑电图数据中电极布局异构性问题，传统方法难以在不同电极配置间泛化，限制了大规模模型构建。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，下游transformer块仅在此潜在表示上操作，使用掩码补丁重建目标进行预训练。

Result: 在TUAR和TUSL等基准测试中达到最先进性能（如TUAR上AUROC为0.921），计算量减少300倍，GPU内存使用减少高达10倍，且在不同电极配置下性能一致。

Conclusion: LUNA成功解决了EEG电极布局异构性问题，为构建可扩展的脑电图基础模型提供了有效方案，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为认知深度学习的新范式，通过随机集神经网络(RS-NN)方法量化认知不确定性，使机器学习模型能够识别自身知识的局限性，避免在不确定性高时做出过度自信的预测。


<details>

Motivation: 机器学习在安全关键领域的部署受到限制，因为现有模型无法有效管理不确定性，在面对分布外数据、对抗性扰动或环境变化时会产生过度自信的不可靠预测。

Method: 开发了随机集神经网络(RS-NN)，利用随机集理论预测类别集合上的置信函数，通过相关置信集的宽度捕捉认知不确定性程度，并将其应用于大语言模型和自主赛车天气分类。

Result: 广泛实验验证，将认知意识整合到深度学习中不仅减轻了过度自信预测相关的风险，还为人工智能范式转变奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 真正的智能涉及识别和管理自身知识的局限性，'知道何时不知道'的能力应成为稳健可靠系统的标志。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Motivation: 识别影响巴西基础教育学生表现的因素，为制定有效公共政策提供依据。

Method: 整合学生社会经济特征、教师专业档案、学校指标和校长管理档案四个数据源，使用随机森林等集成算法，并应用SHAP进行可解释AI分析。

Result: 随机森林模型达到90.2%准确率和96.7% AUC，学校平均社会经济水平是最主要预测因子。

Conclusion: 学业表现是系统性现象，与学校生态系统密切相关，需要关注学校间差异以促进教育公平。

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于同质性的测试时图结构转换方法GrapHoST，通过在测试时调整图结构（增加同质性图或减少异质性图的同质性）来提升预训练GNN模型的鲁棒性和性能，无需模型重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，导致预训练模型性能下降。研究发现通过调整测试图结构可以显著改善模型鲁棒性。

Method: 开发同质性预测器来判别测试边，根据预测的同质性分数置信度进行自适应的测试时图结构转换。

Result: 在9个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，GrapHoST在各种测试时数据质量问题下均取得最先进性能，提升幅度最高达10.92%。

Conclusion: 测试时图结构转换是提升预训练GNN模型鲁棒性的有效方法，GrapHoST方法在不同类型图上都能显著改善性能。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at
https://github.com/YanJiangJerry/GrapHoST.

TL;DR: 开发了MASER预测模型，使用LASSO逻辑回归预测代谢功能障碍相关脂肪肝病，在保持可解释性的同时实现了竞争性性能（AUROC 0.84），并通过公平性后处理减少了种族和民族亚组间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是常见的慢性肝病。早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可复现的预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集（包括前10个SHAP排名特征）。应用机会均等后处理方法减少种族和民族亚组间的真阳性率差异。

Result: 训练数据59,492人，验证数据24,198人，测试数据25,188人。选择前10个特征的LASSO逻辑回归模型。公平性调整前：AUROC 0.84，准确率78%，敏感性72%，特异性79%，F1分数0.617。调整后：准确率81%，特异性94%，敏感性41%，F1分数0.515。

Conclusion: MASER预测模型在MASLD预测中实现了竞争性性能，与先前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。该方法表明可解释模型可以在多样化患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

Result: 内部验证显示模型对33个实验室指标有强预测性能(AUC>0.65)，59个指标中等性能(0.55-0.65)，16个指标性能有限(<0.55)。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效AI驱动解决方案，确立了实时非侵入式实验室值估计的可行性范围。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点状态随时间变化，监控器需要跟踪状态但查询有固定成本，因此需要在预测不确定时查询以平衡成本与准确性。

Method: 使用贪婪策略在预测损失低于查询成本时预测，否则查询；分析其在马尔可夫设置下的性能；针对未知转移概率提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习变体。

Result: 贪婪策略在一般情况下是次优的且竞争比无界，但在相同分布转移概率条件下接近最优；学习变体在预测-查询权衡中表现良好且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 贪婪策略在特定条件下有效，提出的学习算法在未知转移概率情况下能有效平衡查询成本与预测准确性。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

Motivation: 当前LLM可解释性研究主要关注通过代理模块发现特征，但很少系统比较这些学习特征是否比原始模型参数中的特征具有更好的特性。

Method: 重新评估前馈层作为键值记忆存储的特征向量，使用现代可解释性基准进行广泛评估，比较SAE和FF的特征质量。

Result: SAE和FF表现出相似的可解释性范围，SAE在某些方面有微小改进，但在某些方面FF甚至比SAE表现更好，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: SAE相对于直接解释FF特征向量的优势受到质疑，FF键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Conclusion: 提出的四步部分贝叶斯框架能够有效量化本构模型发现中的不确定性，无需先验选择，适用于线性和非线性模型发现。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新审视推理忠实度的方法论工具，帮助识别何时可以信任推理链，何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open
and collaborative research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了平滑梯度上升（SGA）方法来解决LLM遗忘中的梯度上升（GA）不稳定性问题，通过在遗忘数据与构造的正常数据之间进行可调节的平滑处理，实现更稳定的遗忘同时更好地保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM遗忘旨在以低成本使模型忘记危险/不需要的知识，同时尽可能保持模型效用。现有方法中，梯度上升（GA）虽然直接但存在严重不稳定性，会导致模型效用急剧下降。

Method: 提出平滑梯度上升（SGA）方法，将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调节的平滑率结合，从仅学习遗忘数据扩展到同时学习遗忘和正常数据。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上持续优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升机制有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现了更稳定的LLM遗忘。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出用康威生命游戏替代dropout进行正则化，通过动态单元失活和空间模式演化来提高神经网络泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统dropout技术存在静态性和缺乏可解释性的局限，需要更动态、自适应的正则化方法。

Method: 将神经网络单元表示为生命游戏网格中的细胞，应用游戏规则动态失活单元，让空间模式根据训练数据自适应演化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法与传统dropout性能相当，同时通过可视化演化模式提供网络行为洞察。

Conclusion: 生命游戏驱动的动态正则化是有效的dropout替代方案，适用于深层架构，并能增强不同dropout技术的性能。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Motivation: 在线平台用户行为不断变化，导致模型性能随时间下降（数据漂移）。传统持续学习方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，而回放方法受限于缓冲区大小。

Method: 提出增强式回放持续学习框架，利用外部知识库进行数据增强，克服缓冲区大小限制，整合多种策略评估外部知识在持续学习中的作用。

Result: 在三个异常行为分类数据集上的实验表明，基于增强的方法优于基线回放方法，有效提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 外部知识增强能有效提升回放式持续学习性能，为解决数据漂移和灾难性遗忘问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Motivation: 研究在流式设置下使用有限精度计算进行PCA的问题，旨在理解量化分辨率对主成分估计精度的影响，为低精度流式PCA提供理论基础。

Method: 采用Oja算法进行流式PCA，在线性和非线性随机量化方案下对权重向量和更新进行无偏随机量化，在温和的矩和谱间隙假设下分析性能。

Result: 建立了量化分辨率的信息论下界，证明批处理版本在两种量化方案下都能达到该下界（至多对数因子），在非线性量化设置下实现了近乎维度无关的量化误差。

Conclusion: 低精度流式PCA方法在理论上是可行的，通过适当的量化策略可以接近标准Oja算法的性能，为资源受限环境下的流式PCA提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

TL;DR: SmartMixed是一种两阶段训练策略，允许网络学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持推理时的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数神经网络架构仍依赖固定、统一的激活函数，但不同神经元可能需要不同的激活函数来优化性能。

Method: 第一阶段：神经元通过可微分硬混合机制从候选池（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh、Leaky ReLU、ELU、SELU）中选择激活函数；第二阶段：根据学习到的选择固定每个神经元的激活函数。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的评估显示，不同层的神经元对激活函数有不同偏好，揭示了神经网络架构中的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed策略能够有效学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持计算效率，支持继续训练和优化的向量化操作。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图提示方法主要关注特征导向的提示，忽视了拓扑导向提示的潜力，导致性能次优。本研究旨在探索图拓扑在提示学习中的重要作用。

Method: 将拓扑导向提示重新定义为多跳局部子图中的边重连问题，通过重参数化将其松弛到连续概率空间，同时保证紧密松弛和保持图稀疏性。

Result: 在5个图数据集和4种预训练策略下的大量实验表明，GraphTOP在多个节点分类数据集上优于6个基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphTOP框架有效证明了拓扑导向提示在适应预训练GNN模型中的重要性，为图提示学习提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GradLite是一种内存高效优化器，通过低秩Jacobian近似和误差反馈校正技术，在丢弃中间激活的情况下实现高效训练，减少50%内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需要精确梯度，导致大语言模型全微调时内存消耗巨大。现有解决方案要么改变模型架构，要么以计算换内存，但优化器本身未被改进。

Method: 使用低秩Jacobian近似降低反向传播误差信号的维度，结合误差反馈校正技术积累和补偿近似误差，保持收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析显示GradLite保持无偏梯度估计和有界方差，实证显示减少50%优化器状态和激活内存消耗，在推理、多语言和对话基准上达到或优于基线性能。

Conclusion: GradLite是一种向后兼容的优化器，无需架构改变即可显著降低内存消耗，同时保持训练效果。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了比多个基线方法更好的权衡。

Conclusion: CORGII是第一个使用离散token映射到高效倒排列表的稠密图表示索引器，为图检索任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量训练数据，在可控性和泛化性方面存在局限，需要开发数据效率更高、更可控的3D生成方法。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化对齐SDF解码器，然后在对齐权重空间中求解参数约束的混合问题，并使用线性度不匹配检测几何有效性。

Result: LAMP仅需100个样本即可实现边界内可控插值，支持超出训练范围100%参数差异的安全外推，在物理性能优化方面表现优异，显著优于条件自编码器和DNI基线。

Conclusion: LAMP推进了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

Conclusion: 通过人类分区监督的可扩展监督框架能够有效解决前沿AI系统评估和训练中的人类监督瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

TL;DR: 本文分析了连续扩散在离散数据上表现不佳的原因，提出了token可识别性分析框架，揭示了离散身份腐蚀和连续秩退化两种机制的时间不协调问题，并提出了CANDI混合框架来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法。这种差距与直觉相悖，因为连续扩散学习到的分数函数能够实现多个位置的联合演化。本文旨在理解这种性能差距的根本原因。

Method: 提出了token可识别性分析框架，识别出高斯噪声通过离散身份腐蚀和连续秩退化两种机制破坏离散数据。为解决时间不协调问题，提出了CANDI混合框架，将离散和连续腐蚀解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，并证明CANDI成功避免了这一问题。在可控生成任务中，CANDI通过简单梯度加法实现了基于分类器的引导；在文本生成任务中，CANDI在低NFE下优于掩码扩散，证明了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，通过解耦离散和连续腐蚀机制，成功解决了时间不协调问题，为离散数据上的连续扩散方法提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，通过分治策略减少递归次数，实现动态规划。

Result: 在极具挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL算法通过分治范式有效解决了离线GCRL中的值学习问题，在减少偏差累积和方差方面表现出色，特别适用于长轨迹场景。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RIDGE框架，通过联合去噪图输入和监督目标来提高有符号图神经网络的鲁棒性，扩展了图信息瓶颈理论以处理输入和目标空间中的噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的有符号图存在噪声，现有研究缺乏理论指导下的鲁棒SGNN方法，需要同时处理输入数据和监督目标中的噪声问题。

Method: 基于图信息瓶颈理论，提出RIDGE框架，通过重参数化机制和变分近似实现输入数据和监督目标的联合去噪，形成可处理的优化目标函数。

Result: 在四个主流有符号图数据集上的实验表明，RIDGE显著提高了流行SGNN模型在不同噪声水平下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDGE通过扩展的图信息瓶颈理论有效解决了有符号图中输入和目标空间的噪声问题，为鲁棒有符号图学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SDC-GBB框架，通过分支定界方法解决约束聚类问题，能处理大规模数据集并保证全局最优性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了约束聚类的实用性

Method: 将必须链接样本压缩为基于质心的伪样本，通过几何规则修剪不能链接，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能处理20万样本的不能链接约束和150万样本的必须链接约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免现成启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

TL;DR: 提出随机搜索神经网络(RSNNs)替代随机游走神经网络(RWNNs)，通过在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖，显著降低采样复杂度，并在分子和蛋白质基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走神经网络在现实采样约束下无法捕获小图的全局结构，因为节点和边覆盖不完整，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络，每个随机搜索保证完整的节点覆盖，与通用序列模型结合时成为通用逼近器。

Result: 在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖，相比RWNNs所需的O(|V|)次游走大幅降低采样复杂度；在分子和蛋白质基准测试中始终优于RWNNs，使用最多16倍更少的采样序列实现相当或更优性能。

Conclusion: RSNNs为基于随机游走的方法提供了理论和实践上的进步，为稀疏图学习提供了高效且表达力强的框架。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

TL;DR: IsoNet++是一种早期交互图神经网络，通过跨图消息传递、惰性对齐更新和节点对伙伴交互等创新技术，显著提升了子图匹配的检索性能。

Motivation: 现有的子图同构检索方法如IsoNet采用后期交互模型，独立计算图嵌入后再进行对齐。IsoNet++旨在通过早期交互机制更有效地捕捉图间结构关系，提升匹配精度。

Method: 1) 在输入图之间进行跨图消息传递；2) 多轮惰性对齐更新，每轮基于当前对齐状态重新运行GNN；3) 引入节点对伙伴交互概念，考虑节点对而非单个节点作为潜在伙伴。

Result: 实验表明对齐在多轮中逐步优化，在多个数据集上取得了比现有方法显著更好的检索性能，所有三个创新技术都对精度提升有贡献。

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、惰性对齐更新和节点对伙伴交互的创新设计，有效提升了子图匹配的检索准确性。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/structlearning/isonetpp.

TL;DR: 本文提出FAPO方法，通过识别和惩罚有缺陷的正向推理轨迹，解决强化学习中LLM推理能力优化的问题，提高推理的可靠性和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中，模型会将包含错误推理模式（如猜测答案、跳跃推理）但得到正确答案的轨迹视为正向信号，导致模型学习不可靠的推理模式，限制了后期推理能力的提升。

Method: 提出FAPO方法，包含参数自由的奖励惩罚机制，在预热阶段利用有缺陷轨迹作为捷径，在精炼阶段转向可靠推理；引入生成式奖励模型GenRM，通过过程级奖励精确定位推理错误。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加计算开销。

Conclusion: FAPO通过有缺陷感知的策略优化，平衡了早期能力提升和后期推理可靠性，为LLM推理能力优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Motivation: 随着技术进步，从不确定性源（如不确定传感器或机器学习模型）捕获的过程日志越来越多，这些随机日志包含概率信息，需要可靠的随机轨迹恢复方法来理解系统过程。

Method: 基于扩散去噪概率模型(DDPM)的深度学习方法，利用过程知识（隐式发现模型或显式注入过程知识到训练阶段）通过去噪来恢复轨迹。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法达到最先进性能，比现有方法提升高达25%，在高噪声水平下具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的DDPM方法在随机轨迹恢复任务中表现出色，特别是在高噪声环境下，为理解不确定过程系统提供了可靠手段。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法需要事先知道时间范围长度T，或者使用性能较差的加倍技巧，限制了实际应用。需要开发无需先验知识的随时算法。

Method: 使用时变Lyapunov函数来跟踪约束违反，而非固定Lyapunov函数。引入新的分析技术来处理时变Lyapunov函数带来的挑战。

Result: 算法对任意t≥1实现了O(√t)遗憾和Õ(√t)累积约束违反界，并扩展到动态遗憾设置和乐观设置。

Conclusion: 提出的随时在线算法在无需先验知识的情况下实现了最优性能，并通过数值实验验证了实用性。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Conclusion: 提出的动态调整插值参数方法能有效提升半监督学习性能

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实工业系统中多元时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）导致学习模式失真，以及复杂深度模型过拟合污染数据且推理延迟高，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出CLEANet框架：1）污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），通过自适应重构加权策略和聚类引导的对比学习减轻污染样本影响；2）轻量级共轭MLP，解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系，避免过拟合并提高计算效率。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法，F1分数提升高达73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%。将CRTF集成到三个先进模型中，平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多元时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有强泛化能力和实际部署价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Result: 在真实世界基准测试中，RS-Pool相比现有池化方法，在面对最先进对抗攻击时提供了更好的鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 池化操作在图神经网络的对抗鲁棒性中扮演关键角色，RS-Pool方法通过理论分析和实验验证证明了其在提升图分类任务鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Result: M-LCB确保整体遗憾界为Õ(√(KT/M) + (K/M)^(1-α)T^α)，其中α为专家内部遗憾指数

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过正交基和过完备框架替代传统数据增强，有效提升了自监督学习的性能，特别是在时序任务中表现出色

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Result: 

Conclusion: 流匹配在生成建模中的成功启发了价值估计的生成范式，FlowCritic为价值分布建模提供了新思路

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型需要准确预测和透明推理，但缺乏大规模专家级数据集来捕捉具有精确视觉基础的逐步推理过程。

Method: 构建S-Chain数据集，包含专家标注的医学图像、边界框和结构化视觉链式思维，明确链接视觉区域与推理步骤。使用该数据集对医学和通用VLMs进行基准测试，并研究其与检索增强生成的协同作用。

Conclusion: S-Chain为基于视觉的医学推理建立了新基准，为更可信和可解释的医学VLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

Conclusion: Centrum是首个实现无分布性的自动调优器，首次将梯度提升集成与共形推断无缝融合在贝叶斯优化中，显著提升了DBMS自动调优的实用性

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的模糊集设计为分布鲁棒优化提供了有效且可解的解决方案，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

Motivation: 现有方法在修剪Transformer层时通常需要重新训练，且不能保证任务性能的提升。TALE旨在通过直接优化任务特定性能来实现无需重新训练的层修剪，同时提高准确性和效率。

Method: TALE在推理时通过评估任务特定验证性能来选择性移除Transformer层。该方法分析各层对任务性能的贡献，识别并移除那些可能降低任务相关表示的瓶颈层。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在所有基准测试中一致提高了准确性并减少了计算成本。在微调过程中应用TALE还能带来额外的性能提升。

Conclusion: TALE提供了一种无需重新训练的有效层修剪方法，能够生成更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时为Transformer可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，静态缩放因子γ难以适应输入数据和分布变化的广泛变异性，限制了模型性能提升，特别是在大语言模型常见的零样本场景中。

Method: 提出SeeDNorm动态归一化层，基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数，保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化，同时保持RMSNorm在反向传播中根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中验证了有效性，引入极少参数且对模型效率影响可忽略，性能始终优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等常用归一化层。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态调整缩放系数有效解决了静态归一化的局限性，在保持效率的同时显著提升了模型性能，特别是在零样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

Conclusion: 图推荐中的归纳迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

*Soham Pahari,Sandeep Chand Kumain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络的混合预测框架，用于印度大城市的空气质量指数预测，在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等污染物上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气污染严重，污染物水平突然飙升给及时干预带来挑战。由于同时存在线性趋势、季节性变化和波动性非线性模式，准确预测空气质量指数具有难度。

Method: 使用LOESS分解将AQI序列分为趋势、季节性和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块（多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络与残差门控注意力机制）捕捉残差中的多尺度波动性。通过UAMMO优化器调整模型超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年中央污染控制委员会的AQI数据集上，该方法在所有污染物（PM2.5、O3、CO、NOx）和三个主要城市中均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²得分高于0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架在应对突然污染事件方面表现出鲁棒性和敏感性，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

*Jingxin Zhan,Yuze Han,Zhihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在随机多臂老虎机问题中的最后迭代收敛速率，证明了使用1/2-Tsallis-INF算法的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法的收敛分析对机器学习理论至关重要，其中最后迭代收敛特别重要，因为它捕捉了学习者的实际决策。然而在多臂老虎机中，现有分析主要关注遗憾阶数，最后迭代收敛速率研究较少，特别是对于广泛研究的FTRL算法。

Method: 使用与BOBW FTRL算法1/2-Tsallis-INF相关的正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i定义的Bregman散度，分析最优臂点质量与算法在第t次迭代获得的臂集概率分布之间的散度衰减速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，部分证实了对数遗憾应该对应t^{-1}最后迭代收敛速率的直觉。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了BOBW FTRL算法在多臂老虎机问题中的最后迭代收敛速率，为理解这类算法的收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

TL;DR: LOGAN将GAN训练与逻辑约束结合，通过有界深度的Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé博弈来验证生成样本的逻辑正确性，在模拟和真实神经网络训练中均取得高属性满足率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合GAN的生成能力和逻辑验证，确保生成样本满足特定逻辑属性，同时提供可解释的失败原因和可控的生成过程。

Method: 使用深度k的EF博弈，判别器作为对手寻找逻辑故障，生成器作为构建者生成与目标理论T在k轮内匹配的样本，结合逻辑损失函数进行训练。

Result: 模拟验证达到92%-98%属性满足率，真实神经网络GAN训练在挑战性属性上提升5%-14%，连通性属性达到98%满足率。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一种紧凑、可复现的逻辑有界生成方法，具有可解释的失败、经过验证的有效性以及可控的生成参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单细胞RNA测序数据的潜在即插即用扩散框架，通过分离观测空间和去噪空间来提高聚类准确性。该方法使用Gibbs采样在潜在空间进行去噪，同时在原始观测空间重新引入噪声来引导过程，确保去噪轨迹忠实于原始数据结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据存在测量噪声和生物变异性，导致在标准潜在空间中不同细胞类型的数据可能投影得很接近，使得准确聚类变得困难。

Method: 引入潜在即插即用扩散框架，分离观测空间和去噪空间。使用新颖的Gibbs采样程序：在低维潜在空间应用学习的扩散先验进行去噪，同时在原始高维观测空间重新引入噪声来引导过程。

Result: 在合成数据和真实单细胞基因组数据上评估鲁棒性。在合成数据上，在不同噪声水平和数据集偏移下提高了聚类准确性。在真实单细胞数据上，得到的细胞簇具有更好的生物一致性，簇边界与已知细胞类型标记和发育轨迹更吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法通过输入空间引导的独特设计，提供了自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和可泛化去噪三个关键优势，显著提高了单细胞RNA测序数据的聚类准确性和生物可解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

*Divyesh Savaliya,Marius E. Yamakou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个物理信息机器学习框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振(SISR)是慢-快可激发系统中仅由噪声驱动产生相干振荡的现象，无需外部周期性强迫或接近分岔点。需要开发数据高效且可解释的替代模型来模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性。

Method: 基于噪声增强状态预测器架构的物理信息神经网络(PINN)，将控制随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入网络。复合损失函数整合了数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN准确预测了尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖性，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在精度和泛化性上有显著提升，同时计算需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Motivation: 现有离散扩散模型使用仅解码器架构，需要在每个去噪步骤调用完整网络，计算成本高。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，编码器表示干净令牌，轻量级解码器迭代优化噪声序列，并支持块扩散模型的快速训练。

Result: 在摘要、翻译和数学推理任务上实现了生成质量和推理吞吐量之间的优越权衡。

Conclusion: E2D2框架通过专门的编码器-解码器架构和训练采样算法，显著提升了离散扩散模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

TL;DR: RLPD-GX是一个混合离线-在线强化学习框架，通过将策略优化与安全执行解耦来解决分布偏移问题。奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，而基于投影的守护器保证规则一致执行和安全值备份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习(O2O RL)结合了样本效率和鲁棒探索的优势，但由于离线与在线数据之间的分布偏移而存在不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出解耦框架：奖励寻求学习器自由探索 + 投影守护器保证安全执行；动态课程学习逐步扩展时间视野和退火离线-在线数据混合；证明守护贝尔曼算子的收缩性质。

Result: 在Atari-100k上实现标准化平均得分3.02（比先前混合方法提高45%），具有更强的安全性和稳定性；在安全关键和长视野任务中表现一致优异。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为鲁棒O2O RL提供了一个简单而有原则的途径，为强化学习中探索与安全的协调提供了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，无法满足公共卫生预警系统的长期预测需求

Method: 结合动态时间规整进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构增强气象特征，针对稀疏网络优化的可扩展设计

Result: 在8个监测站多年小时数据上验证，24小时预测R2=0.91，首次实现稳定10天预测（240小时R2=0.73），性能优于现有深度学习方法

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合资源受限的城市环境部署，解决了关键预警系统需求

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来一些研究将基础模型的表示重新用于表型发现，但缺乏严格验证，可能导致表面逼真但临床不连贯的嵌入。

Method: 在HIV抗逆转录病毒治疗和急性低血压数据集上训练了两个自回归模型（LSTM和简化Transformer），训练时添加随机访视间隔，测试序列保持完整，通过患者轨迹合成评估分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两个模型都能复现特征分布，但无法保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练能产生局部逼真性但临床相关性有限。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了领域特定评估的必要性，并支持在微调或部署前使用轨迹合成作为实用探针。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态联邦学习框架PEPSY，通过可学习的客户端嵌入控制来解决现实世界中数据不完整和异构的问题，在严重数据不完整情况下实现高达36.45%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态联邦学习面临数据不完整和异构的挑战，导致局部特征表示不对齐，限制了模型聚合的效果。现有方法假设要么模态集不同但输入特征完整，要么共享模态集但有缺失特征，而本文考虑更一般和现实的设置：每个客户端观察不同的模态子集，并且每个模态内也可能有缺失特征。

Method: 提出基于可学习客户端嵌入控制的局部自适应表示联邦学习框架。这些嵌入编码每个客户端的数据缺失模式，作为重新配置信号，将全局聚合表示与每个客户端的局部上下文对齐。嵌入控制可以在具有相似数据缺失模式的客户端间进行算法聚合，以增强重新配置信号在适应全局表示时的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个具有不同客户端数据缺失模式的多模态联邦学习基准测试中，该方法在严重数据不完整情况下实现了高达36.45%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的PEPSY框架通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据不完整和异构问题，理论分析和实验结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF方法复杂且不稳定，需要寻找更简单有效的LLM对齐方法

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计的偏好优化(MMPO)，最大化偏好文本输出的边际对数似然，使用偏好对作为近似样本

Result: 在135M到8B参数模型上验证，MMPO对超参数β更稳定，在保持竞争性偏好对齐的同时更好地保留基础模型的语言能力

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了改进性能，为LLM对齐提供了更简单稳定的替代方案

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子图匹配在知识图谱问答、分子设计等多个领域都很重要，现有神经方法只占据了设计空间中的少数孤立区域，大部分区域尚未被探索。

Method: 将现有系统重构为统一的图匹配网络设计空间，探索了基于注意力vs软排列的交互方式、节点对齐vs边对齐、以及最终评分网络的形式等关键维度。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，在该设计空间中明智且此前未被探索的选择组合能带来显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究不仅获得了更好的性能，还揭示了有价值的见解，为神经图表示和交互建立了通用的设计原则。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Method: 引入Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs)概念，分析不同网络架构的输出几何特征，通过合成数据和标准图像基准进行验证。

Result: SADs形成了与架构输出几何对齐的自适应基，能够可靠地捕捉细粒度模型行为，并与Wasserstein度量衡量的下游性能相关。

Conclusion: 该工作为解释和预测生成模型的方向性偏置提供了新的视角，SADs可在训练前预测分数模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要在高维空间中生成更接近真实数据的反事实解释，同时处理现实世界中的约束条件（如不可变特征和分类特征）。

Method: 使用离散化方法，通过二分搜索找到决策边界上的多个离散点，然后在这些点中寻找最近的可行的反事实解释。

Result: 在四个不同维度的数据集上，该方法在L2范数距离上比现有方法减少了5%到50%，且能处理现实约束条件。

Conclusion: SSBA算法提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近可行的反事实解释，并在运行时间上优于基于网格的方法。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Conclusion: 示例与组合步骤的对齐对于语言模型的上下文组合能力至关重要，改进的探测任务方法验证了这一见解。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Diffuse to Detect (DTD)框架，通过单步扩散过程预测噪声模式，实现快速精确的异常检测，避免了重建误差。该方法结合图神经网络建模传感器关系，能有效捕捉时空异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在复杂高维数据（如无人机传感器读数）中存在灵敏度有限、可扩展性不足以及无法捕捉复杂依赖关系的问题，难以满足操作安全需求。

Method: DTD框架创新性地将扩散模型用于异常检测，采用单步扩散过程预测噪声模式。通过图神经网络将传感器关系建模为动态图，捕捉空间和时间异常。采用双分支架构，结合参数化神经网络能量评分和非参数统计方法。

Conclusion: DTD的通用性和适应性使其成为安全关键应用（包括工业监控等）的变革性解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为GSPO算法的重要性权重提供信息论解释，帮助理解其经验特性（如对数域方差减少和混合专家模型训练稳定性）。

Method: 通过数学推导建立GSPO序列级权重与困惑度比率、交叉熵变化的等价关系，并在数学推理任务上进行受控实验验证。

Result: 验证了数学等价关系的正确性，并证实了方差预测，为GSPO算法的信息论解释提供了实证支持。

Conclusion: GSPO算法通过困惑度比率加权策略梯度更新，这一信息论视角有助于解释其经验特性，包括方差减少和训练稳定性。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 持续学习对LLMs适应知识增长至关重要，但缺乏统计可靠性保证，特别是在持续领域预训练场景中，传统共形预测面临分布偏移和预测集过大的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应拒绝和非交换共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，能够准确预测在不同预训练预算下的领域适应损失，并在多语言设置中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，限制了其预测在不同tokens-per-parameter（PTPP）下训练模型的适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发了PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，能够在未见过的PTPP值下预测适应损失。

Result: 在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）中，使用早期阶段（PTPP={15,31}）训练的PTPP感知公式能够准确预测PTPP=279时的目标损失，并在多个指标上优于PTPP不可知的基线方法。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能够预测适应性能，还能在实际应用中规划重放比例和适应token预算，在计算限制下满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

Motivation: 辅助学习需要人工标注辅助任务，这需要大量人力和领域专业知识。现有元学习方法使用双级优化，但计算成本高且代码复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，RL代理为每个训练数据点选择辅助标签，当选择能提升主任务性能时获得奖励。同时实验学习每个数据点的辅助损失权重策略。

Result: 在20超类CIFAR100问题上，RL方法优于人工标注辅助任务，与主流双级优化技术表现相当。权重学习方法显著超越所有基准，如VGG16架构达到80.9%测试准确率，而人工标注方法为75.53%。

Conclusion: 证明了RL是动态生成辅助任务的可行方法，并且可以同时学习辅助任务标签和每样本权重，获得强劲结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）对城市稳定性和公平性的挑战，需要整合物理灾害建模与社会公平的决策支持系统。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合（IoT、无人机、卫星）和强化学习自适应权重调整，结合公平风险分析和前瞻性干预策略。

Result: 在部分传感器失效情况下，H-RDT能保持稳定的室内温度预测（约31-33°C）；前瞻性干预措施可将人口加权热风险降低11-13%，尾部风险降低7-17%，过热时间减少达9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为实际城市实施提供了可转移的基础框架，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能相结合，推动数字城市韧性向自适应、学习型和公平中心的决策支持发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过汉克尔奇异值正则化来压缩状态空间模型的方法，使模型在保持高精度的同时实现高达10倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络在长序列任务中表现良好，但训练后压缩困难。作者希望通过正则化汉克尔奇异值来获得可压缩的模型。

Method: 开发了一种高效计算汉克尔奇异值的算法，利用状态空间模型参数化中系统矩阵的块对角结构，在训练迭代中实现可扩展的正则化。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化的状态空间层比标准状态空间层压缩率高10倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 汉克尔奇异值正则化是压缩状态空间模型的有效方法，能够显著提高模型压缩率而不损失性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA)方法，将流形几何融入核对齐任务，相比传统CKA方法更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CKA方法不考虑底层流形结构，依赖多种启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致。

Method: 提出MKA方法，将流形几何纳入核对齐框架，并建立了理论框架。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界示例上的实证评估表明，MKA比现有方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 流形感知的核对齐为衡量表示提供了更鲁棒的基础，在表示学习中有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建完全可定制和自适应的系统，避免依赖单一预训练模型，实现从图像直接翻译文本的可行性验证。

Method: 使用U-Net检测图像文本区域，Tesseract提取源文本，自定义Transformer模型在多语言平行语料库上进行翻译。

Result: 在文本检测精度、文本识别质量和BLEU评分翻译性能方面表现出有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 验证了自定义构建系统直接从图像翻译文本的可行性，展示了端到端多语言翻译流水线的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SARNet框架，通过结合现代时序卷积网络和尖峰感知检测，提升剩余使用寿命预测的准确性和可解释性，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有剩余使用寿命预测模型在故障起始点附近表现脆弱、对工程师不透明的问题，如短时高能量尖峰被平滑或误读、固定阈值降低敏感性、缺乏物理解释等。

Method: 基于现代时序卷积网络预测退化敏感指标，采用自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠的随机森林-轻量梯度提升回归器生成最终RUL预测。

Result: 在事件触发协议下的基准数据集上，SARNet相比近期基线方法持续降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），同时保持轻量、鲁棒且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet框架通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，有效提升了剩余使用寿命预测的准确性和实用性，为系统可靠性增强和维护风险降低提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现增强大型语言模型的推理能力会因果性地增加工具幻觉，这种效应与训练方法无关且难以缓解，揭示了当前推理增强方法在可靠性与能力之间的根本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有观察表明更强的推理能力往往伴随着更多的幻觉，但缺乏系统研究来确认推理增强本身是否导致工具幻觉。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验研究推理增强与工具幻觉的因果关系，评估不同缓解策略。

Result: 推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果比例关系，该效应超越过拟合且方法无关，缓解策略显示可靠性与能力之间存在根本权衡。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法固有地放大工具幻觉，需要开发能同时优化能力和可靠性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型无法有效捕获并发预测token间的依赖关系，导致在token依赖重要时生成质量下降。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜变量，通过变分推理显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集、数独谜题和文本数据集上的实验表明，VMD成功学习到了传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系，提高了生成质量和全局一致性。

Conclusion: 将变分推理集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，能够增强生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)在数据不平衡情况下的泛化性能，发现相比传统梯度下降(GD)，SpecGD能更均衡地学习数据的所有主成分，从而在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究其泛化特性，特别是在什么情况下它们能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用数据不平衡作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中进行理论分析。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，SpecGD能均衡学习数据的所有主成分，而GD优先学习主导主成分。SpecGD在训练早期就展现出更好的平衡准确率，且这种优势在深度线性模型中被放大。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据底层成分的更均衡学习，实现了更好的泛化性能，这一发现在多种不平衡数据集上得到了验证。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

TL;DR: 提出QoSMGAA架构，通过多阶注意力机制和对抗神经网络提升QoS预测精度，在稀疏和噪声数据环境下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息，在极端数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能较差。

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本捕获高阶交互。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在复杂噪声网络服务环境中具有强实用性，适用于服务选择和推荐场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有等变模型主要针对旋转等简单对称性，无法处理科学领域中常见的更广泛的一般线性变换群GL(n)对称性，需要开发能够处理这类复杂对称性的新架构。

Method: 引入ReLNs架构，包含新颖的伴随不变双线性层，能够稳定地实现李代数特征和矩阵值输入的等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Result: 在sl(3)和sp(4)对称性的代数基准测试中优于现有方法；在洛伦兹等变粒子物理任务中取得竞争性结果；在3D无人机状态估计中显著提高轨迹精度。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 本文证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，比传统认为的1更紧，并展示了这一更紧常数对鲁棒性和收敛性理论结果的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的理论分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够紧，限制了理论分析的精度。

Method: 通过数学分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下的Lipschitz常数，并验证其在p=1和p=∞时达到1/2，在p∈(1,∞)时严格小于1/2但极限为1/2。

Result: 证明了softmax函数具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，这一更紧的常数直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。

Conclusion: 本文首次对softmax的Lipschitz连续性进行了全面的范数统一分析，证明了其Lipschitz常数为1/2，这一发现对机器学习理论和实践具有重要意义。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在孤立学习关系元知识时无法捕捉跨任务共享的关系模式，且难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Result: 在三个KG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在物联网入侵检测系统中面临严重类别不平衡、非IID数据分布和高通信开销的挑战，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型），结合双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数，服务器使用归一化梯度聚合。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD数据集上的实验表明，Sentinel显著优于现有联邦学习方法，在极端数据异构情况下建立新的性能基准，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel框架有效解决了联邦入侵检测系统中的关键挑战，实现了深度本地适应与高效全局共识的平衡，同时保护客户端隐私并降低通信成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Conclusion: 所提出的草图算法在实际数据集上表现出轻量级和低误差的特点，为大规模动态数据流处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

*Christos Thrampoulidis,Sadegh Mahdavi,Wenlong Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了两种看似不同的Pass@K目标策略梯度优化方法（直接REINFORCE和优势塑造技术）实际上是等价的，通过逆向工程和正向推导建立了它们之间的理论联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和强化学习中Pass@K目标优化的两种不同方法，揭示它们之间的内在联系，为RLVR策略梯度优化提供统一的理论视角。

Method: 通过逆向工程分析现有优势塑造算法，发现它们隐式优化代理奖励；同时从代理奖励目标出发，推导出新的优势塑造方法。

Result: 证明直接REINFORCE方法和优势塑造技术是同一枚硬币的两面，建立了它们之间的等价关系，并提供了推导新方法的简单方法。

Conclusion: 为RLVR策略梯度优化提供了统一的理论框架，证明了两种方法的等价性，并扩展了优化视角到Pass@K之外的应用场景。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在离散状态空间中从未归一化密度采样的挑战，特别是在无需目标分布样本或计算配分函数的情况下进行采样。

Method: 基于连续时间马尔可夫链的正向均匀扩散核，提出目标具体评分恒等式，通过蒙特卡洛估计具体评分，并用神经网络近似具体评分，开发了自归一化和无偏两种TCSIS算法。

Result: 在统计物理问题中验证了TCSIS方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种有效的离散状态空间采样方法，无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算，在统计物理应用中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

TL;DR: 神经网络算子仅使用低精度数值求解器数据训练，却能超越训练数据的精度限制，在长时间推演中达到比训练求解器更高的精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点——神经网络模拟器的精度受限于训练数据的保真度，探索神经网络能否超越其训练数据源的限制

Method: 理论分析模拟器归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性之间的相互作用，并在多种PDE上使用标准神经网络架构进行实证验证

Result: 发现神经网络模拟器能够隐式学习比训练数据更正则化的动力学，具有更有利的误差累积特性，在某些操作机制下可能超越训练数据源

Conclusion: 需要重新评估模拟器基准测试方法，神经网络模拟器在特定操作机制下可能实现比训练源更高的物理保真度

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

TL;DR: 提出了感知-决策交错Transformer（PDiT）架构，通过在单个Transformer中交替感知和决策层，让决策反馈动态优化感知特征，并结合对比损失对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉场景特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构将感知（如CNN视觉编码器）与决策（策略网络）分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要内容，这种分离效率低下。

Method: 实现PDiT架构，在Transformer中交替感知和决策层；集成受CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉场景特征。

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中评估PDiT编码器，相比标准PPO基线获得更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主代理的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了低延迟、节能的边缘推理，适合长期边缘操作，为智能家居手势识别提供了可行的部署方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

Conclusion: 预测基准测试不仅是评估实践，更是机器学习中概念和理论推理的关键场所，需要明确的构建效度条件来支持科学推断。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

Result: 实验结果显示SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子相似性显著提高了数据生成效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Conclusion: 提出的插值算法能有效降低计算成本，并为参数化图族提供了新的应用可能性。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

*Qi Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GCAO算法，通过群体驱动的引力优化机制解决高维非均匀分布数据聚类问题，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在处理高维和非均匀分布数据时，低密度边界样本容易受到邻近簇干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体；结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑构建有效的引力相互作用；使用群体作为基本运动单元，实施引力收缩策略。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上实验表明，GCAO优于11种代表性聚类方法，在NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC指标上分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持簇完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

*Félix Chavelli,Paul Boniol,Michaël Thomazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标WARI和SMS，解决了现有指标在评估分割质量方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用点基指标如ARI，这些方法无法捕捉分割段的质量、忽略错误性质且可解释性有限。

Method: 开发了WARI（加权调整兰德指数）考虑分割错误的位置，以及SMS（状态匹配分数）这种细粒度指标，能够识别并评分四种基本分割错误类型并允许错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上经验验证表明，WARI和SMS不仅提供更准确的分割质量评估，还能揭示传统指标无法获取的错误来源和类型等洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS解决了时间序列分割评估的关键限制，提供了更全面和可解释的性能评估框架。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

*Xinhai Wang,Shu Yang,Liangyu Wang,Lin Zhang,Huanyi Xie,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PAHQ的新方法，通过逐注意力头量化来加速自动电路发现，在保持分析忠实度的同时显著降低计算时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动电路发现方法在大型语言模型中存在计算效率低下和内存需求过高的问题，而现有的加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度。

Method: PAHQ方法通过优化每个单独补丁操作的效率，利用激活补丁与混合精度量化之间的基本对齐关系，仅对研究的组件保持高精度，同时安全地降低网络中其他部分的精度。

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗减少高达30%，同时保持忠实度。该方法无需训练即可与现有的基于边缘的电路发现技术集成。

Conclusion: PAHQ为加速机制可解释性方法提供了一条实用且新颖的途径，通过修改注意力计算机制实现了高效的电路发现。

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个统一的多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输表示对齐和条件图生成融合方法，有效解决蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声关系图问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异质的内在信号（如序列和结构）和噪声的外在上下文（如蛋白质相互作用和GO注释），但存在跨模态分布不匹配和噪声关系图阻碍有效融合的问题。

Method: 提出DAMPE框架，包含两个核心机制：1）基于最优传输的表示对齐，建立不同模态内在嵌入空间的对应关系；2）基于条件图生成的信息融合方法，通过条件编码器融合对齐的内在嵌入来重建图。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配DPFunc等最先进方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013 pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007 pp。消融研究显示OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064 pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111 pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著增强了蛋白质功能预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

### [401] [Learning from Frustration: Torsor CNNs on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23288)
*Daiyuan Li,Shreya Arya,Robert Ghrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Torsor CNNs框架，用于在具有局部对称性的图上学习，通过边势编码相邻坐标系之间的群值变换，与群同步问题等价，提供局部等变卷积层和几何正则化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变神经网络依赖单一全局对称性，无法处理具有局部对称性的领域，需要能够处理图上局部对称性的框架。

Method: 引入边势（群值变换）编码局部对称性，构建Torsor卷积层和frustration损失，该框架在任意图上运行，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构。

Result: 建立了该框架的数学基础，证明其与群同步问题的等价性，并在多视角3D识别中验证了适用性。

Conclusion: Torsor CNN框架统一并推广了多种架构，为处理局部对称性提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

TL;DR: MIO是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于从动态系统的多个观测轨迹中推断符号常微分方程(ODEs)。它结合多实例学习和符号回归，利用重复观测学习更通用的动态表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的符号回归方法通常只使用单个观测轨迹，未能充分利用同一系统的多个观测实例。MIO旨在通过多实例学习更好地利用重复观测数据，提高动态系统建模的泛化能力。

Method: 结合多实例学习和基于Transformer的符号回归，研究不同的实例聚合策略（如简单均值聚合），在1到4维系统上评估模型性能。

Result: MIO在不同噪声水平下始终优于现有基线方法，即使是简单的均值聚合也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: MIO通过多实例学习方法有效提升了符号ODE推断的性能，证明了利用多个观测轨迹可以学习到更鲁棒和通用的动态系统表示。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能耗高且不太可能在大脑中实现，预测编码作为更高效的脑启发算法具有替代潜力，但深层PC网络仍难以训练。

Method: 采用优化理论方法分析PC学习动态，将其理解为近似信任域方法；研究PC如何利用高阶信息；基于推理动态研究提出μPC参数化方法。

Result: 证明PC学习动态可理解为使用二阶信息的近似信任域方法；PC能利用任意高阶信息，学习景观比损失景观更良性；μPC首次实现100+层网络稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PC网络推理和学习动态的基本理解，但PC要与BP竞争需要未来硬件协同设计研究。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Motivation: 确保自动驾驶车辆传感器数据的可靠性，在实时应用中平衡检测精度和计算成本，保障车辆安全运行。

Method: 结合强化指数移动平均(REMA)进行异常值检测，多级滑动窗口(MS-SW)捕获短期和长期模式，使用轻量级门控循环单元(GRU)模型检测和分类异常类型，并包含数据恢复模块。

Result: 异常数据F1分数97.6%，正常数据F1分数99.4%，能够高精度分类不同异常类型，恢复模块能准确修复受损传感器数据，在检测精度和计算成本之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: GRAD是自动驾驶系统中可靠高效的实时异常检测解决方案，能够保证车辆安全运行且计算开销最小。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决S-LoRA在多设备设置中存在的通信开销问题，特别是在实际部署中可能较大的通信延迟。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，设计无需额外通信的LoRA适配器分片策略，与基础模型的张量并行执行良好对齐。

Result: 在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B获得最高1.79倍端到端加速，参数效率为0.87倍；Llama-3.1-8B获得最高1.63倍端到端加速，参数效率为0.86倍。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA在保持与标准LoRA相似参数效率的同时，显著提升了多GPU环境下的服务性能，是高效的LoRA适配器服务解决方案。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习Sigmoid算子的乘法更新近端梯度算法(SSO-PGA)，用于解决传统PGA在非负逆问题中的不稳定收敛和负值问题，并通过展开为深度网络结合优化可解释性和深度学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法(PGA)在图像重建等逆问题中经常产生不稳定收敛和次优解，违反关键的非负约束，梯度下降步骤是问题的根源，会引入负值并导致对超参数高度敏感。

Method: 用可学习的基于Sigmoid的算子替代梯度下降步骤，将传统的减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制实施非负性和有界性；增加滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将优化算法展开为深度网络。

Result: 广泛的数值和真实世界实验表明，该方法显著超越了传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保了优越的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的SSO-PGA方法通过乘法更新机制有效解决了传统PGA的非负约束问题，在保持优化可解释性的同时提升了深度学习的表达能力，在逆问题中表现出色。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,
generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery
tasks.

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接优化max@k指标的方法，解决了RLVR在数学和编程领域微调过程中可能损害模型探索能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在单次生成问题解决中表现出色，但强化学习微调过程可能会降低模型生成多样性，导致在Best-of-N采样中性能下降。

Method: 推导了max@k指标的无偏策略梯度估计，并扩展到离策略更新以提高样本效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在离策略场景下有效优化了max@k指标，使模型与Best-of-N推理策略保持一致。

Conclusion: 提出的目标函数能够有效解决RLVR微调中的探索能力下降问题，优化max@k性能。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

*Youngjun Choi,Joonseong Kang,Sungjun Lim,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Eigen-Value (EV)框架，一种用于OOD鲁棒性数据评估的即插即用方法，仅使用ID数据子集，通过特征值谱分析估计域差异，无需额外训练循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据评估方法基于ID损失，在OOD场景下泛化能力差，而OOD感知方法计算成本高，难以实际部署。

Method: 使用ID数据协方差矩阵的特征值比率来谱近似域差异，通过扰动理论估计每个数据点对该差异的边际贡献，并将其作为附加项集成到基于ID损失的方法中。

Result: EV在真实数据集上实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排名，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为具有域偏移的大规模场景提供了OOD鲁棒数据评估的高效路径，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究在数据受已知分布随机噪声污染时，如何为(k,z)-聚类构建核心集，提出了一种新的替代误差度量方法，能在噪声环境下提供更紧密的聚类成本保证和更小的核心集规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统核心集构建方法假设输入数据是准确的，但在实际应用中数据常受噪声污染。当真实底层数据集不可观测时，评估核心集质量变得困难，需要研究在噪声环境下有效的核心集构建方法。

Method: 提出一种新的替代误差度量方法，该方法独立于噪声分布定义，但能够提供与真实聚类成本相关的近似保证。基于此度量设计核心集构建算法，并在数据和噪声的温和假设下，通过强制执行ε边界来获得更小的核心集。

Result: 理论证明新方法相比传统度量方法，核心集规模最多可减少poly(k)倍，其中n是数据集大小。在真实世界数据集上的实验验证了理论发现，展示了方法的实际优势。

Conclusion: 新提出的替代误差度量方法在噪声环境下能够提供更紧密的聚类成本保证，同时显著减小核心集规模，为噪声数据聚类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: In this work, we study out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning
from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the
generalization problem in meta-reinforcement learning and establish
corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

Conclusion: SNN为概率预测提供了一个连贯、可处理的框架，将点估计提升到基于物理启发的振幅分布。

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用移动用户的地理信息来改进联邦学习，因为不同地理区域的用户数据和行为模式存在差异，需要适应性的模型训练方法。

Method: 将移动设备数据映射到地理区域，每个区域训练一个FL模型；使用分层随机图建模区域间数据相关性；通过MCMC采样选择区域进行梯度融合；采用自注意力权重的随机梯度融合过程。

Result: 在6个国家的心率预测数据集上验证，SGFusion训练的模型收敛且有上界期望误差，在所有国家都显著提升了模型效用，且不影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理信息的概率性梯度融合，有效提升了联邦学习模型的性能，实现了知识在相似区域间的智能共享。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Motivation: 现有的图提示方法主要关注提升下游任务性能，但忽视了预训练GNN模型在适应过程中可能产生的公平性问题，因为下游图数据本身在节点属性和图结构上存在偏见。

Method: 设计自适应特征校正模块学习定制化属性提示来抑制敏感信息；提出自适应消息校准模块生成结构提示来调整邻居节点信息流；联合优化两个提示模块来适应预训练GNN并增强公平性。

Result: 在四个数据集和四种预训练策略上的实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务上优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: ADPrompt框架能有效缓解预训练GNN在下游任务中的公平性问题，通过双重提示机制在保持模型效用的同时提升公平性。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度坍塌和分布不均匀问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Motivation: 深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs在训练过程中面临严重的不稳定性问题，限制了其在多个PDE问题中的应用。

Method: 提出了基础无关的Glorot-like初始化方案来保持激活方差，并设计了Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs)架构来缓解深度KANs的发散问题。

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs在稳定性和准确性上显著优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级。

Conclusion: RGA KANs能够成功穿越所有训练阶段，在cPIKANs停滞的扩散阶段仍能保持稳定，为深度物理信息KANs提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

TL;DR: 提出DFNMF方法，一种端到端的深度非负三因子分解，用于公平图聚类，通过单一参数λ平衡公平性与效用性，实现接近线性的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平图聚类方法存在刚性约束或多阶段流程限制，缺乏权衡控制、可解释性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用深度非负三因子分解，直接优化聚类分配，使用软统计奇偶正则化器，通过稀疏友好的交替更新进行优化。

Result: 在合成和真实网络上，DFNMF在保持相似模块性的同时实现了显著更高的群体平衡，在帕累托前沿上优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: DFNMF提供了一种有效且可扩展的公平图聚类解决方案，通过单一参数实现公平性与效用的灵活平衡。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Seq-MADAC框架，通过考虑多参数间的内在依赖关系来解决动态算法配置问题，使用顺序优势分解网络利用动作顺序信息，在合成函数和多目标优化算法配置中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多复杂算法存在多参数间的内在依赖关系（如先确定算子类型再确定算子参数），但现有方法未考虑这种依赖关系，导致结果次优。

Method: 提出顺序多智能体动态算法配置框架，采用顺序优势分解网络，通过顺序优势分解利用动作顺序信息。

Result: 从合成函数到多目标优化算法配置的实验表明，Seq-MADAC优于最先进的多智能体强化学习方法，并在问题类别间展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为广泛依赖感知的自动化算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

*Zhongyi Yu,Jianqiu Wu,Zhenghao Wu,Shuhan Zhong,Weifeng Su,Chul-Ho Lee,Weipeng Zhuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAMI是一个处理时序图链接预测中异质性问题的框架，通过log时间编码函数和链接历史聚合来改进现有方法，在13个经典数据集和3个TGB数据集上均提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序交互中天然存在异质性，如少数节点对产生大部分交互事件、交互间隔时间不均等，这导致时序信息编码无效和间歇性交互节点对的过去交互被遗忘的问题。现有方法未考虑这种异质性。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含两个组件：log时间编码函数(LTE)将交互间隔转换为更平衡的分布，链接历史聚合(LHA)防止目标节点对的历史交互被遗忘。现有最先进的时序图神经网络可无缝集成到TAMI中。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新时序图基准数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下均能持续提升底层模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI通过有效处理时序交互中的异质性，显著改进了时序图链接预测的性能，特别是在不频繁交互节点对的预测上表现优异。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

*Cheol Woo Kim,Shresth Verma,Mauricio Tec,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PRO方法，通过轻量级的分布鲁棒优化来解决DPO对噪声敏感和容易过拟合的问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法虽然流行但容易受到数据噪声影响并导致过拟合，现有的DRO方法又存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 基于DPO框架，采用轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，避免不必要的保守性，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务上的实验表明，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体能持续提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，在保持DPO简洁性的同时解决了其噪声敏感性问题，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

### [429] [Beliefs about Bots: How Employers Plan for AI in White-Collar Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21959)
*Eduard Brüll,Samuel Mäurer,Davud Rostam-Afschar*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 通过随机信息干预实验发现，德国税务顾问公司普遍低估了工作的自动化风险。提供相关信息会提高风险感知，但短期内不影响招聘计划，而是提升生产率和财务预期，导致公司内部不平等加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究雇主如何根据自动化风险调整预期，特别是在高技能白领工作中，了解企业是否系统性地低估自动化风险及其对劳动力市场的影响。

Method: 在德国税务顾问中进行随机信息干预实验，比较信息提供前后雇主对自动化风险的认知、招聘计划、生产率和工资预期等变化。

Result: 信息干预提高了雇主对自动化风险的感知，特别是对常规密集型工作；短期内招聘计划不变，但生产率和财务预期上升，工资调整有限；雇主预期在法律科技、合规和AI交互方面会出现新任务，培训和技术采用意愿增强。

Conclusion: 企业系统性地低估自动化风险，信息干预能改变风险认知但不影响短期招聘，反而通过提高生产率和财务预期加剧公司内部不平等，同时促进对新技能和技术的适应。

Abstract: We provide experimental evidence on how employers adjust expectations to
automation risk in high-skill, white-collar work. Using a randomized
information intervention among tax advisors in Germany, we show that firms
systematically underestimate automatability. Information provision raises risk
perceptions, especially for routine-intensive roles. Yet, it leaves short-run
hiring plans unchanged. Instead, updated beliefs increase productivity and
financial expectations with minor wage adjustments, implying within-firm
inequality like limited rent-sharing. Employers also anticipate new tasks in
legal tech, compliance, and AI interaction, and report higher training and
adoption intentions.

TL;DR: 研究发现大城市工资增长更快主要不是因为城市本身，而是由于企业和同事的构成差异以及更快的职业流动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么大城市工资增长更快，检验传统认为的城市人力资本溢出效应的观点。

Method: 使用法国行政数据，通过控制企业和同事构成、分析工作转换率等方法分解城市工资增长溢价。

Result: 80%的城市工资增长溢价在控制企业和同事构成后消失；当关注同一工作的工人时，94.1%的溢价消失，剩余效应统计上不显著。

Conclusion: 城市工资动态主要反映企业和工人的分类筛选以及工作流动速度，而非城市本身产生的人力资本溢出效应。

Abstract: Why do wages grow faster in bigger cities? We use French administrative data
to decompose the urban wage growth premium and find that the answer has
surprisingly little to do with cities themselves. While we document
substantially faster wage growth in larger cities, 80% of the premium
disappears after controlling for the composition of firms and coworkers. We
also document significantly higher job-to-job transition rates in larger
cities, suggesting workers climb the job ladder faster. Most strikingly, when
we focus on workers who remain in the same job -- eliminating the job ladder
mechanism -- the urban wage growth premium falls by 94.1% after accounting for
firms and coworkers. The residual effect is statistically indistinguishable
from zero. These results challenge the view that cities generate human capital
spillovers ``in the air,'' suggesting instead that urban wage dynamics reflect
the sorting of firms and workers and the pace of job mobility.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 使用合成控制法评估2025年1月加州Altadena野火对房价的因果影响，发现显著负面效应且随时间加剧，六个月平均月损失32,125美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估野火灾害对社区房价的因果影响，为火灾频发地区的财务风险提供实证证据。

Method: 采用合成控制法(SCM)，通过加权平均相似城市构建'合成'Altadena作为反事实对照组，假设对捐赠池无溢出效应。

Result: 野火导致房价显著负面效应，随时间加剧。基于稳健后/前处理RMSPE比率在10%水平显著(p=0.0508)，但基于平均后处理差距不显著(p=0.3220)。

Conclusion: 火灾频发地区面临重大财务风险，SCM方法在评估灾害相关经济损失方面有效。

Abstract: This study uses the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to estimate the causal
impact of a January 2025 wildfire on housing prices in Altadena, California. We
construct a 'synthetic' Altadena from a weighted average of peer cities to
serve as a counterfactual; this approach assumes no spillover effects on the
donor pool. The results reveal a substantial negative price effect that
intensifies over time. Over the six months following the event, we estimate an
average monthly loss of $32,125. The statistical evidence for this effect is
nuanced. Based on the robust post-to-pre-treatment RMSPE ratio, the result is
statistically significant at the 10% level (p = 0.0508). In contrast, the
effect is not statistically significant when measured by the average
post-treatment gap (p = 0.3220). This analysis highlights the significant
financial risks faced by communities in fire-prone regions and demonstrates
SCM's effectiveness in evaluating disaster-related economic damages.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个合成AI脆弱性指数(AIVI)，用于评估基础模型生产上游价值链的系统性风险，重点关注计算、数据、人才、资本和能源五个关键输入要素的供应脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型(FMs)的快速发展驱动着当前AI生态系统，但由于数据限制，评估这个快速演进行业的脆弱性具有挑战性。需要一种方法来量化AI核心生产引擎的系统性风险。

Method: 将基础模型产出建模为计算、数据、人才、资本和能源五个输入的函数，使用加权几何平均法聚合各子指数，并采用理论或经验基准进行归一化处理。

Result: 识别出关键脆弱性包括：计算集中度、数据稀缺性和法律风险、人才瓶颈、资本密集度和战略依赖，以及不断增长的能源需求。

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，但这个初步指数旨在量化AI核心生产引擎的系统性风险，并间接揭示下游价值链的风险。

Abstract: The rapid ascent of Foundation Models (FMs), enabled by the Transformer
architecture, drives the current AI ecosystem. Characterized by large-scale
training and downstream adaptability, FMs (as GPT family) have achieved massive
public adoption, fueling a turbulent market shaped by platform economics and
intense investment. Assessing the vulnerability of this fast-evolving industry
is critical yet challenging due to data limitations. This paper proposes a
synthetic AI Vulnerability Index (AIVI) focusing on the upstream value chain
for FM production, prioritizing publicly available data. We model FM output as
a function of five inputs: Compute, Data, Talent, Capital, and Energy,
hypothesizing that supply vulnerability in any input threatens the industry.
Key vulnerabilities include compute concentration, data scarcity and legal
risks, talent bottlenecks, capital intensity and strategic dependencies, as
well as escalating energy demands. Acknowledging imperfect input
substitutability, we propose a weighted geometrical average of aggregate
subindexes, normalized using theoretical or empirical benchmarks. Despite
limitations and room for improvement, this preliminary index aims to quantify
systemic risks in AI's core production engine, and implicitly shed a light on
the risks for downstream value chain.
